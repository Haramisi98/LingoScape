What's all this about?~|~translationMissing
Martin Holt~|~translationMissing
Ah, hello and welcome. I'm Martin Holt, leader of Kourend's Royal Society. This is our little protest against the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
Pleased to meet you, I'm [player name]. So, what's wrong with the Council?~|~translationMissing
Now there's a question! I have a better one. What's right with the Council?~|~translationMissing
I bet you didn't know that the Council was originally only temporary. After the last King died, they were only supposed to rule until his daughter came of age.~|~translationMissing
However, according to the Council, the King's daughter went mad. Such a wonderful convenience for them of course. With her out of the picture, the Council became permanent.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. What else don't you like about the Council?~|~translationMissing
Democracy! That's meant to be the big thing for the Council. Funny thing is, although they're meant to be elected by the people, the same four people have won every single election. Little odd, no?~|~translationMissing
That is a bit suspicious, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Oh my friend, suspicious is the dish of the day whenever the Council is around. And what I've just told you barely scratches the surface. Things have been getting even worse recently.~|~translationMissing
Start the quest A Kingdom Divided?~|~translationMissing
Yes.~|~translationMissing
How so?~|~translationMissing
Do you know of Councillor Sophia Hughes? Lovely lady. Spends her free time with the Disciples of Yama, a wonderful cult of Zamorakian demon summoners.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Hughes? I was the one who helped imprison her in the first place.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so you're the adventurer who's been cooking up a storm around here. Well you'll be pleased to know your hard work was all for nothing. Councillor Hughes has escaped. Lucky her.~|~translationMissing
Escaped? How?~|~translationMissing
Believe it or not, no one actually knows. The Council is trying to keep it all on the down low of course. Almost like they have something to hide.~|~translationMissing
That's quite the accusation. Do you have proof?~|~translationMissing
Oh, we will soon! Just you give it time. They'll slip up sooner or later.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Rather than just waiting for that to happen, maybe I could investigate her escape.~|~translationMissing
What an interesting idea. I suppose you would be well placed to have a little nosey, considering your history with the Councillor. Though you'd need to get permission, of course.~|~translationMissing
How would I do that?~|~translationMissing
I hear the Kourend Royal Guard are leading the investigation. Commander Lydia Fullore is their leader. You'll find her in the castle.~|~translationMissing
I'll go speak to her.~|~translationMissing
Good luck friend. Your eyes are open now. Don't trust the Council.~|~translationMissing
No.~|~translationMissing
Well, I think I'll stay out of this one. Good luck with your protest.~|~translationMissing
As you wish, but you shouldn't be afraid to open your eyes. If you change your mind, we'll be here.~|~translationMissing
(End of dialogue)~|~translationMissing
Hey there. Remind me, where can I find Commander Fullore?~|~translationMissing
She'll be somewhere in the castle.~|~translationMissing
Thank you.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
Commander Fullore~|~translationMissing
I'm Commander Lydia Fullore, leader of the Kourend Royal Guard.~|~translationMissing
Then you're just the person I'm looking for. I'm [player name]. I hear you're the one to talk to about the recent escape of Councillor Hughes.~|~translationMissing
Ah, let me guess, you've been talking to Martin Holt?~|~translationMissing
You know him?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I know him alright. Martin and I have quite the history.~|~translationMissing
Really? He didn't mention it.~|~translationMissing
He wouldn't. He has a very selective memory. I imagine he also didn't mention that he used to work for the Council that he hates so much.~|~translationMissing
No... that's not something that ever came up.~|~translationMissing
Well I imagine his Royal Society friends wouldn't make so much of him if they knew where his loyalties used to lie.~|~translationMissing
So I'm guessing you don't agree with his views on the Council.~|~translationMissing
Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if I did. Martin is always quick to point out the failings of the Council, but he conveniently forgets about all the good they've done.~|~translationMissing
Like?~|~translationMissing
You know that smell in Port Piscarilius?~|~translationMissing
It is a bit ripe there.~|~translationMissing
Imagine that but ten times worse. That's what it was like before the Council had a new sewage system installed. The entire kingdom is now cleaner and safer because of them.~|~translationMissing
Not only that, but without the Council, you wouldn't even be stood here. It was under them that trade with your lands to the east was established.~|~translationMissing
Without those trade routes, you would have no easy way of getting here.~|~translationMissing
I could go on, but I have more urgent things to attend to.~|~translationMissing
Like the escape of Councillor Hughes?~|~translationMissing
Well, since it's clearly no secret, yes. The former Councillor is a dangerous individual, so I want her back in a cell as soon as possible.~|~translationMissing
You know, I might be able to help you with that. In case you didn't know, I was the one who helped catch her in the first place.~|~translationMissing
So, this is what Martin has put you up to! Well, no thank you. The last thing I need is one of his people getting in the way.~|~translationMissing
I'm not one of his people! I barely know him. I'm just a willing adventurer who wants to help.~|~translationMissing
Think about it. However this investigation goes, you'll be seen as biased towards the Council. I'm a neutral third party with no ties to the Councillor or the protesters. I'm in an ideal position to help out here.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... you do have the experience. And I can't deny, the fact that you have the support of the protesters could be useful.~|~translationMissing
This whole situation with Councillor Hughes has caused enough civil unrest. We certainly don't need it to get any worse.~|~translationMissing
Alright, you can help. But for the duration of this investigation, you're working for me. What I say goes, is that clear?~|~translationMissing
Crystal clear. Where do we start?~|~translationMissing
Right now we don't have any leads on where Councillor Hughes might have gone. I'm heading over to her home to see if there's anything there that can help us. You should join me.~|~translationMissing
Let's get going.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. The player and Commander Fullore approach Kingstown, and are stopped by Tomas Lawry and Captain Ginea.~|~translationMissing
Tomas Lawry~|~translationMissing
Commander Fullore! How wonderful to see you.~|~translationMissing
Tomas! What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Why, I'm here about Sophia Hughes of course! As the person who discovered her corruption in the first place, I was an obvious choice to lead the investigation into her disappearance.~|~translationMissing
But that wasn't you! I did all the work!~|~translationMissing
Ah, and hello again, my financially challenged friend! Of course, the capture of Sophia Hughes wouldn't have been possible without your minor contributions.~|~translationMissing
The Kourend Royal Guard are conducting the investigation, Tomas. Your presence is not needed.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's just the thing. Councillor Andrews was so impressed with my work, he put me in charge of this investigation.~|~translationMissing
That is not his call to make! I'm in charge of Council security. This investigation is mine to lead!~|~translationMissing
He is head of the Council. If he wants to make that call, he can.~|~translationMissing
Regardless...~|~translationMissing
Look, I can see you're very passionate, which is wonderful. Tell you what, as you're so eager, I'll allow you both to help me in my investigation.~|~translationMissing
Do join me inside when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Captain Ginea. I'm guessing Lord Shayzien sent you.~|~translationMissing
Captain Ginea~|~translationMissing
He did. He's keen to see this Hughes business sorted quickly.~|~translationMissing
He's not alone there, but he doesn't need to worry. We have things under control.~|~translationMissing
Forgive me Commander, but it doesn't seem like you do. Hughes escaped from right under your nose, and now Councillor Andrews is putting his faith in Lawry over you.~|~translationMissing
While this may be Council business, Lord Shayzien is responsible for dealing with both internal and external threats. He wants to be sure that Hughes won't be an issue.~|~translationMissing
You have my word. She'll be back in a cell before the day is out.~|~translationMissing
I hope you're right. There's already a lot of doubt in the Council these days. It would be rather embarrassing for them if the Shayzien Army had to step in.~|~translationMissing
For someone who supports the Council so much, you don't seem very happy about Councillor Andrews' decision.~|~translationMissing
I can support the Council while not agreeing with every choice they make.~|~translationMissing
I feel like you're not totally being honest with me.~|~translationMissing
Would that be so wrong? I hardly know you.~|~translationMissing
Here's some advice for you~|~translationMissing
focus on the investigation. Leave the politics to the experts.~|~translationMissing
Fine. I guess we'd better get started.~|~translationMissing
Cutscene ends, and the player is now in front of Councillor Hughes' house.~|~translationMissing
Have a look around the house and see if you can find any hints on where Councillor Hughes might have gone. I'll ask around out here and see if anyone's seen anything suspicious.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good.~|~translationMissing
Good luck. Don't let Lawry get in your way.~|~translationMissing
I just need to do something first.~|~translationMissing
Okay, just let me know when you're ready to depart.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to head over to Councillor Hughes' home?~|~translationMissing
(Same as above)~|~translationMissing
Hello again. I hope things are going well.~|~translationMissing
Not too bad thanks.~|~translationMissing
Well, keep up the good work. After all, it would be very awkward for our friends on the Council if you caught Sophia Hughes again.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Your desire to help out with my investigation is to be commended, but you really shouldn't worry. I'll have the former Councillor back in a cell in no time.~|~translationMissing
So you already have some leads?~|~translationMissing
Not just yet. It won't be long though. Not with my resourcefulness!~|~translationMissing
Yeah... second only to your humility.~|~translationMissing
How very kind of you. I should tell you though, a skillset like mine isn't gained over night. If you wish to become like me, it will take a lot of hard work.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep that in mind. Anyway, I should get back to work.~|~translationMissing
I've found something that might be useful.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes? What is it?~|~translationMissing
Looks like the Councillor might be hiding out at Mount Quidamortem.~|~translationMissing
Mount Quidamortem? That's quite the trek.~|~translationMissing
I could go if you like?~|~translationMissing
How very kind of you, but no need. This is my investigation, and I will handle it.~|~translationMissing
Tomas departs for Mount Quidamortem.~|~translationMissing
Sucker.~|~translationMissing
If you say so.~|~translationMissing
I think I know where Councillor Hughes has gone.~|~translationMissing
Where?~|~translationMissing
The Farming Guild.~|~translationMissing
Huh, not where I'd have expected. But maybe that's the point.~|~translationMissing
If you think that's where she is, I'd recommend you go and check it out. I'll keep an eye on things here.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Where abouts is it?~|~translationMissing
North of the River Molch, west of here.~|~translationMissing
Thanks.~|~translationMissing
The Deeper Lode.~|~translationMissing
Seems a risky place for her to go. I'd have thought she'd pick somewhere quieter.~|~translationMissing
If you're sure though, I'd recommend you go and scout it out. I'll keep an eye on things here.~|~translationMissing
It's the pub in Lovakengj, north west of here.~|~translationMissing
The Little Shop of Horace.~|~translationMissing
You don't think Horace is helping her, do you?~|~translationMissing
Well we can't make any assumptions.~|~translationMissing
True. If that's where you think she is, I suggest you go and check it out. I'll keep an eye on things here.~|~translationMissing
It's the general store in Hosidius, south east of here.~|~translationMissing
The Chasm of Fire.~|~translationMissing
That's where most of her cultist friends spend their time, seems a bit obvious.~|~translationMissing
I guess it could still be worth a look. If you think she's there, you should go and scout it out. I'll keep an eye on things here.~|~translationMissing
On the outskirts of Shayzien, west of here.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't know.~|~translationMissing
Well, keep looking around. There must be something here that can help us.~|~translationMissing
What was the date when Councillor Hughes escaped?~|~translationMissing
It was two days ago, on the 26th of Fentuary.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... If she escaped two days ago, why are we only searching her house now?~|~translationMissing
The start of the investigation was... delayed. I can't say any more.~|~translationMissing
Hmm...~|~translationMissing
(Shows other options)~|~translationMissing
Did you know there's a demon upstairs?~|~translationMissing
A demon? Well I guess the Disciples of Yama are known for that sort of thing. Still, that's going to be a nightmare to deal with. Can it get out?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so.~|~translationMissing
Good. Do your best to avoid it and we'll worry about it later.~|~translationMissing
What should I be doing?~|~translationMissing
Have a look around the house and see if you can find any hints on where Councillor Hughes might have gone. I'll ask around out here and see if anyone's noticed anything suspicious.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good. I'll let you know if I find anything.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'm looking for Sophia Hughes.~|~translationMissing
Sergeant~|~translationMissing
Sophia Hughes? The councillor?~|~translationMissing
That's right. I think she might have come here at some point.~|~translationMissing
Well, if she did it wasn't recently. We'd have noticed a councillor.~|~translationMissing
I see. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Horace~|~translationMissing
Hello, I'm Horace. Welcome to my shop. Would you like to buy or sell something?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Who are you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Okay, let's trade.~|~translationMissing
Had any councillors shop here recently?~|~translationMissing
Not as far as I can recall. Councillor Hughes used to order things from time to time, before she was arrested. None of the others have ever shopped here though.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, fair enough.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No, I'm fine.~|~translationMissing
Disciple of Yama~|~translationMissing
Welcome. Have you come to give your soul to the Chasm?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Uh, I believe I'm still using it.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Sophia Hughes.~|~translationMissing
You are not alone in that, but you will not find her here.~|~translationMissing
She's one of your lot though, right? This seems like a good place for her to hide.~|~translationMissing
You are welcome to go in and check. You will find nothing. Sophia Hughes no longer has a place here.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, if you say so.~|~translationMissing
Fuggy~|~translationMissing
Hello, human. What's your pleasure today?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Let's see what you've got.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I don't want to talk about my pleasure.~|~translationMissing
Had any councillors stay here recently?~|~translationMissing
Councillors? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
I'm investigating the disappearance of Councillor Sophia Hughes. I have reason to believe she rented a bed here.~|~translationMissing
A disappearing councillor? That's a new one. We don't really get many humans renting beds here. The only one recently was a woman who stayed here last night, but she didn't look much like a councillor.~|~translationMissing
She could have been in disguise. Do you know where this woman is now?~|~translationMissing
Well she left not long before you got here. I didn't really speak to her but I did hear her mention something about catching a ship at Port Piscarilius.~|~translationMissing
A ship? She's trying to escape! Do you know which ship?~|~translationMissing
Well let's see now...~|~translationMissing
The ground shakes.~|~translationMissing
Blimy! That was a good one!~|~translationMissing
What on Gielinor was that?~|~translationMissing
Ah, not from around here are you? That was an earthquake. We get them here from time to time. I think they come from that volcano to the west, but I'm no expert.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, what were we on about?~|~translationMissing
The Councillor.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the Councillor. I seem to recall her mentioning Veos. It must be his ship she's taking.~|~translationMissing
I need to get there quick. Thank you for the help.~|~translationMissing
Not a problem. Good luck with your search.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you heard any rumours here?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm alright, thank you.~|~translationMissing
So about the Councillor.~|~translationMissing
You again? I've already told you everything. The woman mentioned Veos over at Port Piscarilius. She must be catching his ship.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. I need to get there quickly.~|~translationMissing
Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Err, where's Veos?~|~translationMissing
Cabin Boy Herbert~|~translationMissing
Your guess is as good as mine. He was here until that earthquake. Then he suddenly just wandered off, like he was in some sort of trance.~|~translationMissing
But what about his ship?~|~translationMissing
I guess I'll have to look after it until he comes back. I hope he won't be long. I'm not really cut out for this kind of thing.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you take me somewhere?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a councillor.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
I believe Councillor Sophia Hughes is planning to board this ship. I need to find her.~|~translationMissing
The one that got arrested? If she wants to board the ship she'll need to do it soon. We're nearly ready to cast off. I guess you could wait around and see if she shows up.~|~translationMissing
Not a bad idea. I think I'll do just that.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. Commander Fullore arrives at the port.~|~translationMissing
Heard you were out here. Thought I'd come see how things are going.~|~translationMissing
Not spying on me are you?~|~translationMissing
Spying is a strong word. I just like to keep an eye on people I've not worked with before. Especially in a situation as delicate as this one.~|~translationMissing
That's one way of putting it.~|~translationMissing
So, what of Hughes?~|~translationMissing
She booked passage on this ship, but she's not arrived yet. If she's coming, it will be soon.~|~translationMissing
And we'll be here when she does. Not bad.~|~translationMissing
Starting to trust me now?~|~translationMissing
Don't get ahead of yourself.~|~translationMissing
Ah, looks like we might have a visitor.~|~translationMissing
Sophia Hughes arrives at the port. The music track Confrontation plays.~|~translationMissing
Sophia Hughes. Going somewhere?~|~translationMissing
Sophia Hughes~|~translationMissing
You! This is all your doing!~|~translationMissing
The only person to blame is yourself. When you play with fire, you get burnt.~|~translationMissing
It's over, Sophia. You should come quietly.~|~translationMissing
Commander Fullore! He would send you, wouldn't he? The little lapdog of Councillor Andrews!~|~translationMissing
He knew, you know! They all did. They were more than happy with my work while it was secret. But now they betray me without a second thought, just to protect themselves!~|~translationMissing
You'd think they'd have some loyalty after all we did! After what we did to him. After what we did to his girl! We were in it together until it no longer suited them!~|~translationMissing
What are you on about? What girl?~|~translationMissing
Don't think I'm coming quietly! I've fought too hard to stop now!~|~translationMissing
Judge of Yama, hear my voice! I call upon you to bring justice to the unworthy! Cleanse them in a sea of fire! Cleanse them in a sea of blood!~|~translationMissing
Sophia Hughes casts a spell.~|~translationMissing
Demonic Voice~|~translationMissing
Sophia Hughes. You have called upon me. Those that oppose you will be judged in the name of Yama.~|~translationMissing
But know this, Sophia Hughes. Those that call upon the Judge must first be judged themselves.~|~translationMissing
You have betrayed the trust of Yama, Sophia Hughes. You have used his generosity to your own advantage. For this, your life is forfeit.~|~translationMissing
What? No!~|~translationMissing
Come. Serve your master one last time. Bathe yourself in a sea of fire. Bathe yourself in a sea of blood.~|~translationMissing
No... Wait!~|~translationMissing
Sophia Hughes is burnt to a crisp, and in her place the Judge of Yama appears before the player and Commander Fullore.~|~translationMissing
Judge of Yama~|~translationMissing
And so the justice of Yama has been brought upon Sophia Hughes, as it will be brought upon all who wrong him.~|~translationMissing
Lydia Fullore, [player name]. You have been declared enemies of Yama. Your actions have endangered the work of his children. For this, your lives are forfeit.~|~translationMissing
Hey! You can't just show up and start incinerating people. That's not how justice works. How about you clear off, before I make you!~|~translationMissing
[player name]. You have challenged the Judge of Yama. Your guilt will be determined through combat.~|~translationMissing
Should you succeed, you will be free of your sins. Should you fail, you will be bathed in fire. You will be bathed in blood.~|~translationMissing
Now, in the name of Yama, let us begin.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Well, good luck.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Andrews~|~translationMissing
Here he is, the hero of the hour. On behalf of the Council, and indeed all of Kourend, thank you for dealing with this messy situation.~|~translationMissing
It was nothing.~|~translationMissing
You're far too humble. You've done so much for our kingdom in your short time here. Rest assured, we have noticed. In fact, I consider you a firm friend of the Council.~|~translationMissing
Have you managed to work out how Councillor Hughes escaped?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. You need not worry though, we'll get to the bottom of it. That said, I do have another ask of you... if you don't mind.~|~translationMissing
What is it?~|~translationMissing
Commander Fullore tells me you've had dealings with Martin Holt and his group.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure about dealings, but we've met.~|~translationMissing
Well regardless, your handling of the situation with Sophia Hughes seems to have had quite an impact on them.~|~translationMissing
Well, I am quite impactful. So, what is this ask?~|~translationMissing
This recent situation has been most unfortunate. People are angry, I understand that. That said, Sophia Hughes has been dealt with. It's time for Martin Holt and his protestors to go home.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. You want me to convince them.~|~translationMissing
It would be greatly appreciated. Civil unrest is of no benefit to anyone. We'd all be better off putting this behind us.~|~translationMissing
Now, I must be off. Plenty of work to do. Good luck with Martin and his friends.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Andrews leaves.~|~translationMissing
So what now?~|~translationMissing
We're looking into how Sophia Hughes might have escaped. I'll let you know if we find anything.~|~translationMissing
You know that's not what I mean.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure what you're on about. Now, I'm sorry, but I need to get to work.~|~translationMissing
Commander Fullore begins to leave.~|~translationMissing
*whispers* Meet me just south of the castle.~|~translationMissing
So?~|~translationMissing
Councillor Hughes was a deranged cultist.~|~translationMissing
And yet?~|~translationMissing
I don't know...~|~translationMissing
Do you not know? Or do you just not want to admit it? The man and the girl she spoke of. What did she mean?~|~translationMissing
Ever since King Kharedst IV died, there have been those who have questioned his death. People like Martin.~|~translationMissing
It was all just wild speculation, though. The King was old, and he died of an illness. It happens all the time.~|~translationMissing
The man Councillor Hughes mentioned. It could have been the King she was referring to.~|~translationMissing
Maybe. Or maybe it was someone else.~|~translationMissing
And the girl she mentioned? The King had a daughter.~|~translationMissing
Rose. She was meant to take the throne after him, but she was too young. His advisors took over until she came of age.~|~translationMissing
The Council. It never went that way though, did it? She never took the throne. Martin said they declared her mad.~|~translationMissing
Grief can do a lot to someone. Rose and her father were very close.~|~translationMissing
Listen to us! Are we really considering this? The Council rule Kourend. They have done so successfully for 20 years now.~|~translationMissing
What happened to Rose in the end? Where did she go?~|~translationMissing
After what happened, public life was no place for her. The Council arranged for her to move away so she could escape all of that.~|~translationMissing
So where is she now?~|~translationMissing
Look, I'm the commander of the Kourend Royal Guard. My duty is to the Council.~|~translationMissing
As commander of the 'Royal Guard' your duty is surely to royalty, not to some Council.~|~translationMissing
What kind of person would I be if I betrayed them?~|~translationMissing
What kind of person would you be if you followed them blindly, even when all the evidence says not to?~|~translationMissing
I...~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but I can't.~|~translationMissing
Oh come on...~|~translationMissing
I can't! But you can.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Andrews may have been all nice to you, but he's furious with me. He's blamed me for what happened in Port Piscarilius. I have no hope of doing anything now without him knowing.~|~translationMissing
But you, on the other hand... You're just some adventurer as far as they're concerned. They won't be keeping an eye on you.~|~translationMissing
But where would I start?~|~translationMissing
Rose. If she's still alive, then she's the key to the truth. You have to find her.~|~translationMissing
How?~|~translationMissing
I'm going to hate myself for this, but I know someone who could help.~|~translationMissing
Martin. He's leader of Kourend's Royal Society. He knows more about the last royal family than anyone. If anyone can help you find Rose, it's him.~|~translationMissing
Now, I need to get back inside, before someone finds out I'm missing.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Lydia. I know this can't be easy for you.~|~translationMissing
I really need to go. Speak to Martin, and good luck.~|~translationMissing
Commander Fullore heads back into the castle.~|~translationMissing
Hello.~|~translationMissing
No time to talk I'm afraid. Didn't Councillor Andrews want you to speak to Martin Holt about his protest?~|~translationMissing
Hello again, friend. Isn't it a wonderful day? Sophia Hughes has been dealt with and our wonderfully corrupt Council are out rowing without a paddle. Keep up the good work!~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, friend. Excellent work with Sophia Hughes!~|~translationMissing
Hello Martin. I see your protest is growing.~|~translationMissing
Indeed it is, friend. Would you believe it that apparently some councillor went and summoned a demon in Port Piscarilius? That made a lot of people angry.~|~translationMissing
It seems the guards have also taken interest.~|~translationMissing
No doubt sent by the Council to keep an eye on us. We've got them scared now.~|~translationMissing
Maybe they think things will get violent?~|~translationMissing
And yet they're the ones with the weapons. Interesting, huh?~|~translationMissing
Anyway, what can I do for you, friend?~|~translationMissing
There's something important we need to talk about.~|~translationMissing
Something important? Is it about the Council?~|~translationMissing
It is.~|~translationMissing
Well, what is it? If you have news on the Council, we must let the people know at once.~|~translationMissing
This one needs to stay between you and me.~|~translationMissing
The people have a right to know, my friend.~|~translationMissing
They do. But if what I've discovered is true, we can't let the Council realise we know until we have definitive proof.~|~translationMissing
I see. This sounds serious. What have you learnt?~|~translationMissing
When I confronted Sophia Hughes, she spoke of things the Council did to a man and his daughter.~|~translationMissing
A man and his daughter? Surely this can't mean...~|~translationMissing
Kharedst IV. The last King of Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
I knew it! I knew the Council were involved in his death!~|~translationMissing
Like I said, we have no proof. The dying words of a cultist are not going to be enough to convince many. We need real proof.~|~translationMissing
And this is why you came to me? You have a plan?~|~translationMissing
The King's daughter, Rose. If we can find her, we might be able to find out what happened.~|~translationMissing
But my friend, no one knows where Rose is! Some don't even think she's alive any more. Sadly, most people have just forgotten her completely.~|~translationMissing
But you haven't! You must have some idea of where they might have taken her.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. However, I wonder if Rose herself might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Err... What?~|~translationMissing
The Council didn't declare Rose mad right away. It wasn't until a few weeks after her father died that she was moved away.~|~translationMissing
But how does that help us?~|~translationMissing
Rose was well known for being a good writer, even at her young age. She documented everything she did. She even wrote her father's memoirs for him.~|~translationMissing
If something happened in those few weeks, maybe she wrote about it.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I understand now. That does make sense.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not used the secret page on Kharedst's memoirs~|~translationMissing
You know, I actually ended up acquiring her father's memoirs myself.~|~translationMissing
You did? Interesting. The memoirs were auctioned off recently, along with a lot of other royal possessions.~|~translationMissing
The auction was a request from the King before he died. He wanted the money to go towards helping the poor of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
If the player has used the secret page on Kharedst's memoirs~|~translationMissing
You know, I actually ended up acquiring her father's memoirs myself. There was an interesting page hidden in the book. It suggested that something bad happened to whoever wrote it.~|~translationMissing
And you're only mentioning this now? You had proof that something happened to Rose, and you did nothing with it?~|~translationMissing
Well it wasn't really proof of anything. It gave no details on what actually happened, and no leads to follow. It wasn't even clear if Rose wrote it.~|~translationMissing
Even still, something like that might have been worth bringing up.~|~translationMissing
Well, now you know. I don't see how it helps us, though.~|~translationMissing
The memoirs were auctioned off recently, along with a lot of other royal possessions. The auction was a request from the King before he died. He wanted the money to go towards helping the poor of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
The King's been dead for years. How come the auction only happened recently?~|~translationMissing
For that you can thank our Council friends. They blocked it for years. They said Rose's things should not be included, as the original request only covered her father's possessions.~|~translationMissing
I did wonder if they had more malicious motivations, and now you've confirmed it. They clearly didn't want anyone getting their hands on Rose's writings.~|~translationMissing
Were there any other writings, apart from the memoirs?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Rose's personal diary. It went to the Library Historical Archive. I hear they have it on display there.~|~translationMissing
So I need to go to the Archive and get that diary.~|~translationMissing
The Archive isn't the Library. You can't just borrow things. I doubt they'll let you take it.~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I wasn't actually planning on asking.~|~translationMissing
A [man/woman] who knows what needs to be done. I respect that. Talk to Archeio in the Arceuus Library. He can take you to the Archive. Come back once you have the diary and we'll discuss our next steps.~|~translationMissing
What do I need to be doing?~|~translationMissing
Rose's personal diary is on display in the Library Historical Archive. We need to aquire it. Talk to Archeio in the Arceuus Library. He can take you to the Archive.~|~translationMissing
Istoria~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the Library Historical Archive.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What is this place?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do you do here?~|~translationMissing
I have a question about Rose.~|~translationMissing
Rose? The princess?~|~translationMissing
That's right.~|~translationMissing
Ah, poor girl. Her tale is such a tragic one. What would you like to know?~|~translationMissing
I heard her diary was on display here. I was wondering if I could read it.~|~translationMissing
You are correct that we have her diary. It's in the display case on the eastern wall. That said, I'm afraid I can't let you read it.~|~translationMissing
The diary is here to be preserved. However, we do not feel it appropriate to let people read the private thoughts of a young girl.~|~translationMissing
I see. Fair enough.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How do I get out of here?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, friend. Any luck with that diary?~|~translationMissing
You give Rose's diary to Martin.~|~translationMissing
Good work. Now, let's see if this diary has anything for us...~|~translationMissing
Martin looks through the diary.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Doesn't look to be anything obvious, but that's not suprising. Anything too in your face would have been found by the Council long ago.~|~translationMissing
The hidden page from the King's memoirs was hidden inside the book cover.~|~translationMissing
Let's see if the same trick has been used here.~|~translationMissing
Let's try this...~|~translationMissing
Martin cuts open the cover of the diary and a note falls out.~|~translationMissing
And what do we have here?~|~translationMissing
Martin reads the note.~|~translationMissing
Very interesting. See what you make of this.~|~translationMissing
Martin gives you the note.~|~translationMissing
Well?~|~translationMissing
It's a riddle.~|~translationMissing
That it is. It seems to be describing a location. If we find that location, maybe we'll find something of use.~|~translationMissing
We should split up. The Council could be watching us, and I don't want to make anything too obvious. Let's see who can solve this thing first.~|~translationMissing
Alright. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
We should split up and try to solve the riddle. I'll regroup with you at wherever it leads us.~|~translationMissing
Well here we are.~|~translationMissing
You think this is definitely it?~|~translationMissing
Forthos was the seat of the Hosidius family before it was destroyed in the War of the Five Houses. 'A seat of power, lost in a war of pride.'~|~translationMissing
Anyway, looks like I won this one. What's my prize?~|~translationMissing
I don't think there is one.~|~translationMissing
Pah, that's where you're wrong my friend. This could lead us to the ultimate prize. This could lead us to the truth behind the delightful Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
You really do hate them don't you? You know, Lydia told me you worked for them once.~|~translationMissing
Is that a problem?~|~translationMissing
Just interesting. You went from working for them to being their biggest opponent. What changed?~|~translationMissing
I opened my eyes. When I worked for the Council, I was young and naive. But over time, I came to see the truth.~|~translationMissing
The tipping point came a couple of years ago. I was helping to manage the treasury at the time. We had a big donation come in from a private businessman. Lovely chap.~|~translationMissing
He was ever so noble. Something eating away at his conscience, no doubt. He wanted the money to go towards improved education in Port Piscarilius. He felt it would help with the crime levels there.~|~translationMissing
That was of course a big no-go for the Council. Helping the people? No chance! Instead, they used only a small amount for that. They spent the rest on castle renovations.~|~translationMissing
They claimed the increase in castle tourism would make more money in the long run. A load of tosh! I knew it was just for them.~|~translationMissing
I walked out that same day. Soon after, I founded Kourend's Royal Society. We've been a bane for the Council ever since.~|~translationMissing
Why not mention this before?~|~translationMissing
Wasn't really important. I'm sure Lydia didn't tell you everything about herself either. We were together once, you know. But she was ever loyal to the Council.~|~translationMissing
In the end she decided I wasn't her type, and went off with that Captain Ginea instead. Of course, that didn't work out either. One day she'll stop blaming her problems on everyone else.~|~translationMissing
Is this relevant?~|~translationMissing
Nope. And neither is my history with the Council. Now, let's crack on. Rose led us here for a reason. There must be something hidden nearby.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about Rose?~|~translationMissing
She was born to King Kharedst IV as his first and only child. Her mother died when she was very young, so her father mostly looked after her on his own. The two were very close.~|~translationMissing
She was only 11 when her father died. Even at that age, she had already proven that she was smart, capable and caring. She'd have made a good queen, but the Council put a stop to that.~|~translationMissing
She was 11 when the King died? How old would that make her now?~|~translationMissing
31.~|~translationMissing
31? So wherever she is, she's spent most of her life there. If she's still alive of course.~|~translationMissing
You'd hope that even the Council wouldn't go as far as to kill her, but that's probably wishful thinking. They're as evil as they come.~|~translationMissing
What happens when we find Rose?~|~translationMissing
Hopefully she can give us the truth about her father's death.~|~translationMissing
Okay, but say the Council are guilty? What happens then?~|~translationMissing
Oh they're guilty my friend, make no mistake. We just need proof. Once we have it, we can use it to have them removed from power.~|~translationMissing
After that, Rose can take her rightful place on the throne.~|~translationMissing
And if she's incapable of doing that?~|~translationMissing
Let's cross that bridge if we get to it.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Kourend's Royal Society.~|~translationMissing
The throne of Kourend has sat empty for far too long. After all, what is a kingdom without a king? That was the question I asked myself when I created the society.~|~translationMissing
You see, I'd grown tired of our wonderful Council and their dishonourable ways. I wanted a return to how things used to be. Turns out I wasn't alone.~|~translationMissing
Kourend's Royal Society offers a place for likeminded individuals to share and debate their views without fear of being judged.~|~translationMissing
It's not just about debate though is it? You're trying to spread your views to others with your protests.~|~translationMissing
We know the Council to be corrupt. We feel it only right that all of Kourend know that. The people have a right to the truth.~|~translationMissing
It's interesting that you focus on power for the people but desire a monarchy. Surely a democracy would be more fitting?~|~translationMissing
Democracy is just a fa?ade, my friend. The Council! They're meant to be a democracy! It's all a load of rubbish. Democracy is just a way of pretending the people have power.~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but I don't see how you fix that with a king or queen.~|~translationMissing
Kings and queens are raised from birth to rule. They know how to do it right. Under a king or queen, this kingdom would flourish.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Song of the Elves~|~translationMissing
I can't say I'm convinced.~|~translationMissing
Even with a monarchy, the people still hold the power. Sometimes it just takes them time to realise it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Song of the Elves~|~translationMissing
King Lathas of Kandarin was raised from birth to rule. I'm not sure he did a great job.~|~translationMissing
And what happened to him in the end?~|~translationMissing
The people had him executed.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! Even with a monarchy, the people still hold the power. Sometimes it just takes them time to realise it.~|~translationMissing
I'll get searching.~|~translationMissing
Found anything yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet.~|~translationMissing
Keep looking.~|~translationMissing
You could help, you know.~|~translationMissing
I'll have you know I am helping. I'm looking here.~|~translationMissing
You've been looking there for a while now.~|~translationMissing
I'm being thorough.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do you know about Rose?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What happens when we find Rose?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about Kourend's Royal Society.~|~translationMissing
I'll be back later.~|~translationMissing
Yes! I've found another note.~|~translationMissing
Well what does it say?~|~translationMissing
'Out in a land that's frozen to the bone. A village of statues, not made of stone.'~|~translationMissing
Another riddle. Well, same again then. Let's split up and see if we can find where it leads.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll see you soon.~|~translationMissing
We should split up and try to solve the next riddle. I'll regroup with you at wherever it leads us.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you made it. Welcome to Kourend's top holiday destination. Here you'll find all sorts of fun things like cold, cold and cold.~|~translationMissing
You can say that again. I'm guessing this panel is what we're after.~|~translationMissing
Looks like it. Problem is, it's locked and...~|~translationMissing
Hang on, do you hear that?~|~translationMissing
Assassin~|~translationMissing
Martin Holt. You have been marked for death.~|~translationMissing
Crikey! Are you alright?~|~translationMissing
I'm fine.~|~translationMissing
So now the Council are sending assassins after us. They've got some nerve.~|~translationMissing
We don't know it was the Council.~|~translationMissing
Who else would it be?~|~translationMissing
The assassin only named you. Surely the Council would want me gone as well if they knew what we were doing.~|~translationMissing
Yes, a good point. They clearly don't know what we're doing yet. This must be about the protests instead. They wanted to silence me!~|~translationMissing
Again, we don't know that.~|~translationMissing
It's the only logical explanation. The Council are running scared. They can feel their grip on Kourend loosening and are desperately trying to stop that.~|~translationMissing
Well, Council or otherwise, the assassin is dealt with. Now we need to get this panel open and get out of here.~|~translationMissing
Very true. I tried to open the panel before you arrived, but it needs a key. Perhaps it's hidden nearby.~|~translationMissing
I'll have a look around.~|~translationMissing
Any luck?~|~translationMissing
The panel had another note behind it.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. What does this one say?~|~translationMissing
'Hearty drinks are a sailor's friend. Where one long journey comes to an end.'~|~translationMissing
Another one. I wonder how many there are.~|~translationMissing
Only one way to find out, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Let's split up again. Be careful though. Who knows if the Council will send another assassin.~|~translationMissing
We should split up and try to solve the next riddle. I'll regroup with you at wherever it leads us. Be careful though. Who knows if the Council will send another assassin.~|~translationMissing
Now this is more like it! A nice temperature and a good source of beer. Not to mention the fact that the Council wouldn't dare send an assassin somewhere so built up. Even they're not that stupid.~|~translationMissing
Rose certainly went all out. I wonder how she managed it?~|~translationMissing
Apparently Rose and her father would often make riddles for each other. I'm guessing she was quite fond of them.~|~translationMissing
Even so, I wonder how she set it all up?~|~translationMissing
Never underestimate a child, my friend. I remember a gang of thieves a few years back that used them heavily. The kids could get places the adults couldn't. No one ever suspected them either.~|~translationMissing
They were such a problem that the Council had to get Lord Shayzien to send some soldiers in to deal with them. Lydia was one of them. This was before she joined the Royal Guard.~|~translationMissing
What happened?~|~translationMissing
The Council had them all thrown in prison, even the children. Lydia was distraught. Still, it didn't stop her joining the Royal Guard. She was always blind to the truth.~|~translationMissing
So were you, once. You said that yourself.~|~translationMissing
True, but at least I realised in the end.~|~translationMissing
You know, it was Lydia who sent me to talk to you about all of this in the first place.~|~translationMissing
So maybe she's not as bad as you say.~|~translationMissing
Maybe. Anyway, we have a clue to find. Time to get searching.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. The player looks out on the balcony.~|~translationMissing
Uh oh.~|~translationMissing
Tomas Lawry and two guards appear before Martin.~|~translationMissing
Martin Holt.~|~translationMissing
Tomas Lawry! Backbone of the Kourend Council!~|~translationMissing
How very kind of you.~|~translationMissing
Of course, it's a shame the Council are totally spineless.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. What are you doing here Martin?~|~translationMissing
I'm here for a drink of course. This is a pub, you know. Lovely place to sit back and relax. You should try it some time.~|~translationMissing
This would be easier if you told the truth.~|~translationMissing
I am telling the truth. Is it illegal to go to the pub now?~|~translationMissing
For you, I'm afraid it is. Martin Holt, I am arresting you for inciting violence against the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
Inciting violence? You must be joking! All I've done is express my valid concerns. There is no law against that!~|~translationMissing
You have encouraged people to take up arms against the rightful rulers of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
I have given the people a voice! You cannot silence us all!~|~translationMissing
The people can express their concerns through the proper channels. Now, I must ask that you come with us at once.~|~translationMissing
And if I refuse?~|~translationMissing
Come now, Martin. Let's not go there. You know how it ends.~|~translationMissing
Fine! But the people will not stand for this. I will not be responsible for what happens now!~|~translationMissing
Looks like I'm on my own now.~|~translationMissing
Oh my.~|~translationMissing
Err... Hello.~|~translationMissing
Can you hear me?~|~translationMissing
Rose?~|~translationMissing
A man appears from a cell gate further in the basement.~|~translationMissing
Man~|~translationMissing
What the... Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I could ask you the same question.~|~translationMissing
This place is private! You're not welcome here!~|~translationMissing
Well here's the thing~|~translationMissing
I don't actually care.~|~translationMissing
I came here looking for someone, and I think this woman here might be that someone. If she is, you're in a whole different world of trouble.~|~translationMissing
So tell me, who are you?~|~translationMissing
My god...~|~translationMissing
You're looking for Rose, aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Is this her?~|~translationMissing
It... Yes, this is her.~|~translationMissing
And you are?~|~translationMissing
I'm Councillor Liam Orson, of the Kourend Council. But please, you have to understand...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd very much like to understand. Why are you here with Kourend's missing princess? And why is she just lying there like that?~|~translationMissing
I suggest you explain everything. You should probably do it fast, as well.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Orson~|~translationMissing
I don't know where to begin.~|~translationMissing
How about with her father. How did he die?~|~translationMissing
There was something wrong with him.~|~translationMissing
You expect me to believe that?~|~translationMissing
It's the truth!~|~translationMissing
He was always a fan of antiques. One day he bought some old flask from a stall in Lovakengj. He began drinking from the flask wherever he went, and it started to change him.~|~translationMissing
Change him?~|~translationMissing
The flask was cursed. Some dark magic. He stopped being himself. Started saying things. Things he would do to people. To the citizens!~|~translationMissing
We did what we had to...~|~translationMissing
You killed him. You killed him and took his throne for yourselves.~|~translationMissing
No... We never wanted the throne. The throne was always meant for Rose.~|~translationMissing
Well that clearly didn't happen.~|~translationMissing
She was never meant to be involved. We were just going to look after things until she was ready. But she found out what we did.~|~translationMissing
So you did this to her?~|~translationMissing
We didn't want to hurt her, but we couldn't risk her telling anyone. This was the only way.~|~translationMissing
Well, you failed. She got the word out. It took 20 years, but thanks to her, your rule is at an end.~|~translationMissing
So, what happens now?~|~translationMissing
That's not for me to decide. There's someone who needs to see this.~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to black, and Commander Fullore arrives at the basement.~|~translationMissing
Is it... Is it really her?~|~translationMissing
I think so.~|~translationMissing
And you say she's not aware of... anything?~|~translationMissing
Doesn't look like it.~|~translationMissing
What a mess.~|~translationMissing
What of the Councillor? Where is he?~|~translationMissing
I locked him in the other room. Didn't want him running off. I'll get him.~|~translationMissing
The player opens the cell gates.~|~translationMissing
You can come out now.~|~translationMissing
Councillor.~|~translationMissing
Commander.~|~translationMissing
Liam... tell me it isn't true.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry Lydia.~|~translationMissing
I defended you! I defended all of you! And all this time, you've been lying!~|~translationMissing
I swear to you, we did it for the people.~|~translationMissing
Don't give me that!~|~translationMissing
Look at her! Look at what you did to her! She was a child, Liam!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry.~|~translationMissing
What did you do to her? Why is she like this?~|~translationMissing
We didn't want to kill her. She didn't deserve that. The mage gave us a potion. He said it would stop her revealing the truth.~|~translationMissing
Mage? What mage?~|~translationMissing
There was an Arceuus mage. He was an expert in curses, and he realised what was happening. He gave us the poison for the King.~|~translationMissing
Would have been nice for you to mention this earlier! Who was this mage?~|~translationMissing
He never told us his name.~|~translationMissing
And you trusted him? Are you serious? Some random mage comes along and tells you to poison the King and you just... do it?~|~translationMissing
Everything the mage said was true. The King was cursed. We could see it.~|~translationMissing
Did it ever cross your mind that maybe this mage was the one that cursed him in the first place? How do you know he wasn't just using you?~|~translationMissing
Of course it crossed our minds, but we didn't have a choice. The King was deteriorating by the hour.~|~translationMissing
You could have gone to Lord Arceuus! You could have gone to Lord Shayzien! You could have gone to anyone apart from some random mage!~|~translationMissing
This mage. Have you met him since?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Rose's condition...~|~translationMissing
You mean the condition you gave her?~|~translationMissing
Her condition has no cure, but it can be kept in check with regular treatment. He meets with me and gives me the potions she needs.~|~translationMissing
How do you know it's not the potions that are doing this to her?~|~translationMissing
I've done my research. The potions are safe, and she can't live without them.~|~translationMissing
Where is this mage?~|~translationMissing
We meet outside Molch. I think he lives in the temple there, with the lizardmen.~|~translationMissing
This mage. We need to find out who he is.~|~translationMissing
I'll go to Molch. If he's there, I'll find him.~|~translationMissing
Cutscene ends.~|~translationMissing
Good luck out there. I'll keep an eye on this... I don't even have a word for him.~|~translationMissing
Try not to kill him.~|~translationMissing
I'll do my best.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing?~|~translationMissing
I'd rather not talk about it. We have work to focus on. There'll be plenty of time to contemplate later.~|~translationMissing
How are things back at the castle?~|~translationMissing
Terrible. I take it you heard about Martin?~|~translationMissing
The arrest? I was there.~|~translationMissing
Such a stupid move. I told Councillor Andrews not to do it, but he listened to Lawry instead. Now the protestors are even angrier.~|~translationMissing
At this rate, it's only a matter of time before things get violent. I even had Councillor Unkar moved to the castle for his own safety.~|~translationMissing
Not that he deserves safety! What a mess this is.~|~translationMissing
I'd better be off.~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello there.~|~translationMissing
I have a question for you.~|~translationMissing
What do you know of this mage?~|~translationMissing
Very little. It was David... Sorry, Councillor Andrews, who he contacted first. The rest of us didn't meet him until much later.~|~translationMissing
He was an expert in old curses. He could see what was wrong with the King. He told Councillor Andrews and offered his help.~|~translationMissing
By then, it was already too late. The King had deteriorated too much. There was only one solution.~|~translationMissing
I don't know if that's true.~|~translationMissing
You weren't there. You didn't see what was happening to him. There was no time to consider other options. We did what we had to do.~|~translationMissing
If you say so. You said he lives in Molch?~|~translationMissing
That's right. In the temple, I think.~|~translationMissing
A mysterious mage with no name who lives with some lizardmen. He sure sounds like an upstanding citizen with nothing suspicious about him at all.~|~translationMissing
You're not funny. Do you think we'd have worked with him if we knew all of that? We didn't find out about the lizardman connection until much later. By then, the deed had already been done.~|~translationMissing
I'm suprised you'd even care about lizardman. They're pretty tame compared to demon summoning.~|~translationMissing
Sophia wasn't always like that. Before she joined that cult, she was just like the rest of us. The only difference was that she had other beliefs.~|~translationMissing
Zamorakian beliefs aren't particularly welcome in most places.~|~translationMissing
So what? People should be entitled to their beliefs!~|~translationMissing
Sure, but I suspect being entitled to summon demons is more up for debate.~|~translationMissing
Like I said, she wasn't always like that.~|~translationMissing
What happened with Rose?~|~translationMissing
I know you probably don't believe it, but we always meant for her to take the throne.~|~translationMissing
I guess I'd probably have an easier time believing that if she wasn't lying right here instead.~|~translationMissing
She overheard us talking about the King. We couldn't let her tell anyone.~|~translationMissing
But why? If it was really all about her, why would it matter what happened to you?~|~translationMissing
Because without us, who would have been left to rule? We had to do it for the good of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Did you? Or have you lied to yourself so much that you now actually believe it?~|~translationMissing
She was like a daughter to me!~|~translationMissing
So you poisoned her?~|~translationMissing
And I have taken care of her every day since! Without me, she wouldn't even be alive.~|~translationMissing
Is what she has now really much of a life at all?~|~translationMissing
You don't understand...~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I don't know if I want to.~|~translationMissing
Actually, never mind.~|~translationMissing
You need to find out who this mage is.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry. I'll work it out.~|~translationMissing
Kaht B'alam~|~translationMissing
Yesss?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) You can speak!?~|~translationMissing
I have a question about that door over there.~|~translationMissing
Yesss? What about it?~|~translationMissing
Not got any mages hiding behind it have you?~|~translationMissing
Magesss? You know of the Yo'kal ahk?~|~translationMissing
Yo'kal ahk?~|~translationMissing
It isss the name we ussse for the mage you ssspeak of. In your ssspeach, he hasss another name.~|~translationMissing
This mage. Where did he come from?~|~translationMissing
He hasss been here sssince our massster ssstill walked among usss. He wasss sssealed away before, but they releasssed him so he could guide usss.~|~translationMissing
I need to see this mage. How do I get through the door?~|~translationMissing
It is closssed, but there are keysss. We shhhamansss carry them.~|~translationMissing
Well can I have your key?~|~translationMissing
Perhapsss. But why shhhould I help you?~|~translationMissing
I could just kill you instead?~|~translationMissing
And I could shhhout for help. Humansss are not meant to be in thisss temple. Do you think you can sssurvive usss all?~|~translationMissing
Alright. What do you want in return?~|~translationMissing
A trade? Yesss, that worksss well.~|~translationMissing
The mage you ssspeak of. He sssends us to fight the humansss. He sssays we mussst do it for our massster, but he isss long gone.~|~translationMissing
I am done with thisss fighting. I want to ssserve our massster in other waysss.~|~translationMissing
I could help you escape?~|~translationMissing
I am a shhhaman. I need no help from humansss.~|~translationMissing
What, then?~|~translationMissing
The hatching area in the ssswamp, to the sssouth wessst of here. My lassst egg isss there. If I go and it ssstays, it will die in thisss falssse war.~|~translationMissing
So if I bring you this egg, you'll give me the key?~|~translationMissing
Yesss. The egg isss marked with the sssymbol of our massster. Go fassst human.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Why are you down here?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Nevermind, bye.~|~translationMissing
So, about the key to that door...~|~translationMissing
Yesss. I can give you the key, but firssst I need my lassst egg. It'sss at the hatching area in the ssswamp, to the sssouth wessst of here.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll bring you the egg.~|~translationMissing
It isss marked with the sssymbol of our massster. Go fassst human.~|~translationMissing
Yesss. I can give you the key, but firssst I need my lassst egg.~|~translationMissing
I have it here.~|~translationMissing
You give the egg to Kaht B'alam.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, human. You have given usss a chance for a new ssstart. Here isss the key.~|~translationMissing
Kaht B'alam gives you a key.~|~translationMissing
Be cautiousss of the Yo'kal ahk human. He isss very dangerousss.~|~translationMissing
I'll be careful.~|~translationMissing
Ye niauh, human. Perhapsss we will meet again.~|~translationMissing
So, about that door over there...~|~translationMissing
Ussse the key I gave you. That will get you inssside. But be cautiousss of the Yo'kal ahk human. He isss very dangerousss.~|~translationMissing
You hear a conversation taking place in the next room...~|~translationMissing
First Mysterious Voice~|~translationMissing
...actually quite surprised. I thought you of all people would have made more of an effort to find me.~|~translationMissing
Second Mysterious Voice~|~translationMissing
Your greatest achievement was my downfall, my lord. The lizardmen blamed me for your disappearance and sealed me away. I was trapped for centuries.~|~translationMissing
And yet, here you are.~|~translationMissing
I managed to convince their shamans I was on their side. They set me free. I have been trying to find you ever since.~|~translationMissing
Except you were beaten by a treasure hunter.~|~translationMissing
With humble respect, my lord, this treasure hunter is not the one to thank.~|~translationMissing
It was me. I was the one who worked out how to find you. I planted the seeds that eventually led him to you.~|~translationMissing
A proxy? Interesting. I wouldn't have thought you would be one to hide away.~|~translationMissing
The world has changed. Working from the shadows has served me well. And now it has reunited us once more.~|~translationMissing
Yes, the earthquake. That was a considerable amount of dark energy. Something I could not ignore. But to what end?~|~translationMissing
The same end as always, my lord. Quidamortem has been lost to us, but there are other ways to harness the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
I see. And tell me, what of this Council that now rules Kourend? I sense your work at play there.~|~translationMissing
I needed access to the Altar. They were a means to an end.~|~translationMissing
You installed some puppet rulers just to access the Altar? My my, Xamphur, you haven't lost your ambition.~|~translationMissing
Xamphur~|~translationMissing
Never, my lord. I also hoped that access to Kourend would have further uses, but I fear the Council is done.~|~translationMissing
From what I hear, you are likely right. No matter, though. Kourend is of limited use to us.~|~translationMissing
My lord?~|~translationMissing
That kingdom was always a means to an end. A disappointing necessity while we were still shackled.~|~translationMissing
But now, those shackles are gone. I have discovered a new way to achieve our goals, and this time, none will stand in our way.~|~translationMissing
Now, we have much time to make up. Unfortunate, but bearable. Soon time will be of little meaning to us.~|~translationMissing
Ah, but on that note, it seems this conversation is at an end, for we are no longer alone.~|~translationMissing
Deal with your guest Xamphur. We will meet again in the south.~|~translationMissing
It will be done, my lord.~|~translationMissing
The player is forcefully teleported.~|~translationMissing
Veos?~|~translationMissing
Veos teleports away.~|~translationMissing
What the...~|~translationMissing
Xamphur approaches the player.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hi there.~|~translationMissing
So I think I took a wrong turn somewhere. I'll just go now...~|~translationMissing
Go? No I don't think so.~|~translationMissing
You have heard too much. You have seen too much. You won't be going anywhere.~|~translationMissing
Ah. Well in that case... Xamphur, was it? How about you tell me what on Gielinor is going on here?~|~translationMissing
Really? You think this is the part where I tell you everything?~|~translationMissing
No, no, no. This is the part where you die.~|~translationMissing
Really now? You actually thought you could defeat me?~|~translationMissing
The player is knocked out by a powerful lightning spell, and a cutscene begins.~|~translationMissing
First Lizardman~|~translationMissing
What are we sssupposssed to be doing?~|~translationMissing
Second Lizardman~|~translationMissing
The Yo'kal ahk wantsss thisss corpssse removing.~|~translationMissing
Are you sssure it'sss dead?~|~translationMissing
It looksss dead.~|~translationMissing
Eugh...~|~translationMissing
It'sss a zombie! Let'sss get out of here!~|~translationMissing
The lizardmen leave, and the cutscene ends.~|~translationMissing
Huh? What happened?~|~translationMissing
I guess I should have a look around.~|~translationMissing
Among other things, the table is covered in books and notes. One note looks to have been written fairly recently. You decide to give it a read...~|~translationMissing
Councillor Andrews isn't happy. This is the first time I've directly asked him to perform a task for me. Still, he soon calmed down after a little reminder of who gave him the throne. After all, he wouldn't want the others finding out he was in on it from the start. If he plays up again, I might remind him that Rose still lives. It would be a shame if anyone found out about that.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, early readings are looking good. He placed the device right next to the Altar, just as requested. That said, I likely won't have long to acquire and store the energy needed. The device will no doubt interfere with the ascended humans of Arceuus. They will soon realise something is amiss.~|~translationMissing
Once I have the energy needed, I know the perfect place for a little test. There's an old Shayzien General buried near the battlefront. His grave is nice and remote. No one will miss him if he goes for a little walk.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I should tell Lydia about this.~|~translationMissing
You're back.~|~translationMissing
I am. Where's the Councillor?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I didn't kill him. I was sick of looking at him, so I moved him somewhere safe. He won't be going anywhere.~|~translationMissing
Did you find the mage?~|~translationMissing
I did, but he got away. To be honest, he also left me with more questions than answers.~|~translationMissing
His name is Xamphur. I overheard a conversation between him and someone else. They talked about the Council, among other things.~|~translationMissing
The weird thing is, the person he was talking to... I think it was Veos.~|~translationMissing
The treasure hunter?~|~translationMissing
Yes. He disappeared after that earthquake, but I saw him with this mage.~|~translationMissing
The conversation? What was it about?~|~translationMissing
Xamphur called Veos, or whoever it was, his master. It sounded like he had been seeking him out for a long time.~|~translationMissing
They talked about the Council and the Dark Altar. I couldn't make much sense of it, but I managed to look around after they left.~|~translationMissing
From what I found, it seems that Xamphur worked with Councillor Andrews to manipulate the other councillors into killing the King.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Andrews was in on it from the start? That monster.~|~translationMissing
It seems he always wanted the throne. Xamphur offered it to him in return for access to the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
The Dark Altar? Why?~|~translationMissing
Xamphur has been redirecting power from the Altar, but I don't know why. It seems his work is what caused the recent issues in Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
The death? I heard about that.~|~translationMissing
Makes you wonder what else he's been responsible for.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure what any of this means, but it can't be good. We need to do something. But first...~|~translationMissing
What?~|~translationMissing
Rose. What do we do with her?~|~translationMissing
I did some research while you were gone. Liam wasn't lying. The poison they gave her irreversibly destroyed her mind. There is no cure.~|~translationMissing
I suspect Xamphur won't be making her any more potions any time soon. Maybe someone in Arceuus could help?~|~translationMissing
Someone else could make the potions, but all they do is prolong her suffering.~|~translationMissing
What are you saying?~|~translationMissing
This is no life for anyone. The truth is, Rose died long ago. All that's left now is an empty shell.~|~translationMissing
Oh... I think I understand.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, Rose.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins, with the player and Commander Fullore in front of Rose's grave.~|~translationMissing
Back when I was a girl, there was this Shayzien patrol that would go past our house each morning. Every day I would run out to wave at them as they went by.~|~translationMissing
For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to join the army. 'Become a farmer or a chef,' my parents would say to me. 'The army isn't for you.'~|~translationMissing
But I knew what I wanted, and I knew nothing would stop me from getting it.~|~translationMissing
I saw some nasty things while serving the Council. I'd always tell myself that it was necessary.~|~translationMissing
Whenever I thought about giving up, I'd ask myself who I'd be replaced with. Even if things weren't perfect, I was in the best place to improve them.~|~translationMissing
It was all a lie though, wasn't it? It's always been a lie.~|~translationMissing
To think it was Martin who was right all along!~|~translationMissing
We can still make this right. We can still stop the Council.~|~translationMissing
We won't be able to do it alone. The Council still holds the power in Kourend.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure if that's true. The real power is held by the five houses of Kourend. Together, they could replace the Council and take over the kingdom.~|~translationMissing
We'd need to get them all on board.~|~translationMissing
Leave that with me.~|~translationMissing
Alright, you gather the five leaders. Convince them to meet us at Xeric's Lookout, south east of Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
It's where I left Councillor Orson. We won't be disturbed there.~|~translationMissing
Consider it done.~|~translationMissing
It feels wrong, her being out here. She should have had a proper funeral.~|~translationMissing
It's not so bad. It's nice and peaceful. She's finally free from the drama of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
I guess you're right.~|~translationMissing
We'd better get going. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
You too.~|~translationMissing
The cutscene ends.~|~translationMissing
Have you spoken with all the leaders yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm still working on it.~|~translationMissing
Keep at it. We'll need all five of them on board. When you speak to them, tell them to meet us here.~|~translationMissing
The trapdoor is securely locked.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Orson is down there. I'm keeping it locked, just in case.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough.~|~translationMissing
Lord Trobin Arceuus~|~translationMissing
Good day friend.~|~translationMissing
Hello Lord Arceuus. There's something I need your help with.~|~translationMissing
What do you need?~|~translationMissing
We should discuss it in private. It involves the Kourend Council. It's also connected to the recent death here.~|~translationMissing
I see. Then I will come at once. Where shall we meet?~|~translationMissing
Xeric's Lookout.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I will join you there soon.~|~translationMissing
Thank you Lord Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
About the Council...~|~translationMissing
I will join you at Xeric's Lookout soon.~|~translationMissing
Lord Kandur Hosidius~|~translationMissing
Hello there.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius. I need to discuss something with you.~|~translationMissing
We can't talk about it here. I need you to meet me at Xeric's Lookout.~|~translationMissing
Well you have helped me in the past. That said, I can't just go running off to Xeric's Lookout for no reason.~|~translationMissing
It's about the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. Then the day has finally come.~|~translationMissing
There has been discontent with the Council since the day they took control of the kingdom. That was always going to come to a head at some point.~|~translationMissing
It seems that point has now arrived. I will depart for Xeric's Lookout shortly.~|~translationMissing
Will you be departing for Xeric's Lookout soon?~|~translationMissing
I will. But there are a few things I need to prepare first.~|~translationMissing
Lady Vulcana Lovakengj~|~translationMissing
Oh look, it's the human. Hello human.~|~translationMissing
Lady Lovakengj. I need you to join me at Xeric's Lookout. There's something urgent we need to discuss.~|~translationMissing
Urgent?~|~translationMissing
That's right. We can't discuss it here, but it involves the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Well you really should speak to Councillor Unkar. He's part of the Council, you know.~|~translationMissing
That's not quite what I meant. It's not something to discuss with the Council themselves. It's something I need the house leaders for.~|~translationMissing
Oh...~|~translationMissing
So will you come?~|~translationMissing
Come where?~|~translationMissing
To Xeric's Lookout. To discuss this Council business.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the Council business at Xeric's Lookout. I will come at once, but first...~|~translationMissing
Jorra! Bring me a sherry.~|~translationMissing
Jorra~|~translationMissing
Yes Lady Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
So about that Council business...~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes. Come to Xeric's Lookout. I'll be there as soon as I've finished this sherry.~|~translationMissing
Lady Shauna Piscarilius~|~translationMissing
What do you want?~|~translationMissing
I need your help. It's about the Council.~|~translationMissing
Anything to do with that demon you summoned on my docks?~|~translationMissing
That wasn't me! Besides, I'd have thought you'd be happy to see Sophia Hughes dealt with.~|~translationMissing
I'd have preferred it be done without demons being involved. Idiots will be idiots, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Come on then, tell me about this latest Council nonsense.~|~translationMissing
We can't discuss it here. We need to be somewhere more private.~|~translationMissing
Oh I'm sorry. Is my secret hideout in the sewers not private enough for you now?~|~translationMissing
Well... not really. Meet me at Xeric's Lookout. We can talk more there.~|~translationMissing
Fine. But if you waste my time you will seriously regret it.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Whatever you say.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to get off my back? I already said I'll meet you there. Now clear off.~|~translationMissing
There's something urgent I need your help with.~|~translationMissing
Lord Shiro Shayzien~|~translationMissing
What is it, citizen?~|~translationMissing
It involves the Kourend Council, but we can't really discuss it here. Come alone to Xeric's Lookout.~|~translationMissing
Alone?~|~translationMissing
I appreciate it's an unusual request, but yes please. All of Kourend could be at stake here.~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose you have been a friend to Shayzien in the past, and this does sound serious.~|~translationMissing
Very well citizen. I will depart soon.~|~translationMissing
I will depart for Xeric's Lookout soon, citizen. I have a few things I need to do first.~|~translationMissing
Well you did it. It's been a while since I've seen the leaders of all five houses together. They're downstairs waiting.~|~translationMissing
Is the Councillor there as well?~|~translationMissing
He is. I told him about Rose.~|~translationMissing
How did he take it?~|~translationMissing
How do you think?~|~translationMissing
We'd better keep a close eye on him.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Now, let's get down there.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins, with the leaders of the five houses gathered.~|~translationMissing
This is quite the group you've gathered here.~|~translationMissing
Indeed it is my lord, but I assure you, it's for a very good reason.~|~translationMissing
Liam.~|~translationMissing
My lords and ladies, there is something I must make you aware of.~|~translationMissing
It's regarding myself and my fellow councillors. We...~|~translationMissing
Yes?~|~translationMissing
I can't...~|~translationMissing
Yes you can Liam, and you will.~|~translationMissing
Don't you lecture me! You have no right! You killed her!~|~translationMissing
What on Gielinor are you fools on about? Killed who?~|~translationMissing
They call me a murderer, but they killed Rose! I kept her safe!~|~translationMissing
No. You killed Rose. You killed her 20 years ago. It's time to stop hiding and accept the truth.~|~translationMissing
Rose? You speak of the King's daughter. What happened?~|~translationMissing
This coward here killed her, just like he killed her father.~|~translationMissing
We did it for the good of the kingdom...~|~translationMissing
You did it for yourselves!~|~translationMissing
The King was cursed!~|~translationMissing
The King was cursed so that you had an excuse to kill him. It was never about the people, it was only about the throne.~|~translationMissing
That's not true!~|~translationMissing
I have seen proof with my own eyes. If you think overwise, then you have been fooled as well.~|~translationMissing
Could you idiots please stop arguing and give us an explanation!~|~translationMissing
Councillor Andrews plotted to kill the King with a mage called Xamphur. Xamphur cursed the King so that Councillor Andrews had an argument to get the others on board.~|~translationMissing
And then they killed him?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Rose as well.~|~translationMissing
Rose was never meant to get hurt! She overheard us!~|~translationMissing
Rose was smart, but do you really think she just happened to overhear you? I've no doubt Councillor Andrews arranged for that to happen as well.~|~translationMissing
So it's true! I always knew the Council was corrupt, and now we have the proof!~|~translationMissing
So what do we do with this proof?~|~translationMissing
That's why we gathered you all here. The Council needs to be removed from power. You five can make that happen.~|~translationMissing
If the Council are to be removed, they will also have to be replaced.~|~translationMissing
Who should replace them?~|~translationMissing
Could there be another member of the royal family still out there?~|~translationMissing
I doubt it. The Council's plan worked because Rose was the King's only heir.~|~translationMissing
You'd see us go back to a king? The democracy of the Council was false, but democracy is still the answer. Let the people decide!~|~translationMissing
Since when did Lady Piscarilius care for the people? Last I checked, your citizens lived in constant squalor.~|~translationMissing
Don't you lecture me you warmongering fool! I've done more for this kingdom than you'll ever know!~|~translationMissing
Well if you really do care for the people, surely a monarch is perfect. They're crying out for one right now.~|~translationMissing
The royalists do have a lot of support at the moment. But who would this monarch be?~|~translationMissing
I believe I may have an answer to that.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius places the Royal Accord of Twill on the table.~|~translationMissing
What is that?~|~translationMissing
The Royal Accord of Twill.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. This here is the answer to our issue.~|~translationMissing
Once, in a time of great need, the five houses of Kourend took control of this kingdom. Now it falls to us to do so again. It's time for a new accord.~|~translationMissing
You would see us rule together?~|~translationMissing
In a way. Together we would all be responsible for Kourend, but a single individual would rule over the kingdom.~|~translationMissing
A new Royal Accord would require all five us to agree on the contents.~|~translationMissing
Well don't go thinking you're getting me to sign it. I'll have no part in this.~|~translationMissing
Lady Lovakengj, you've been silent on all of this. What are your thoughts?~|~translationMissing
Well... I don't really understand. The Council rule Kourend. We can't just take over.~|~translationMissing
We have to. There is no other option.~|~translationMissing
Goodness... I think I need a sherry.~|~translationMissing
A break might be beneficial to all of us. We have a lot to consider.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. Let's reconvene later.~|~translationMissing
The cutscene ends, and the player and Commander Fullore return to the surface.~|~translationMissing
Well that was fun. What do we do now?~|~translationMissing
This Royal Accord seems like our best bet. A clear document signed by all of them that determines the future of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
For them to all sign it, they all need to agree on the contents. That's not going to be easy.~|~translationMissing
No, but there must be a way. They all seem to have some level of trust in you. Maybe you can convince them.~|~translationMissing
I can give it a go.~|~translationMissing
This could quickly get interesting, but you need to do whatever it takes to get them back at that table. If even one of them walks away, we'll end up with a big problem on our hands.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll go and talk to them all.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of Lord Arceuus?~|~translationMissing
He intrigues me. I find there's a certain level of arrogance when it comes to anyone from Arceuus. Living for a thousand years will do that, I guess.~|~translationMissing
The thing is, he's not like that. He seems to have a lot more humility than the other leaders.~|~translationMissing
Still, I find it hard to trust anyone who's been around that long. Think about what he must have seen and done over the years. He'll have more secrets than the rest of them combined.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of Lady Piscarilius?~|~translationMissing
She's lazy and arrogant. She talks like she cares for the people, but one look at Port Piscarilius shows the truth. She only cares for herself.~|~translationMissing
Maybe there's more to her than meets the eye.~|~translationMissing
You think she really cares?~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't rule it out.~|~translationMissing
Maybe she should start looking after her citizens then. Thoughts and feelings mean nothing when people are suffering.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of Lord Hosidius?~|~translationMissing
He's well-liked by his people, and he does genuinely seem to care for them. The world might be a better place if more leaders were like him.~|~translationMissing
That said, we should still be careful. Everyone has two sides, and he knew exactly what he was doing when he brought out the Royal Accord of Twill.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of Lord Shayzien?~|~translationMissing
I have a lot of respect for him. He's achieved a lot in his short time as a ruler.~|~translationMissing
But?~|~translationMissing
Does there need to be a but?~|~translationMissing
No, but there generally is one.~|~translationMissing
He's a man of war, not peace. You always need to be careful with someone like that. He's also the youngest of all the rulers. Age often brings experience.~|~translationMissing
Often, but not always.~|~translationMissing
True.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of Lady Lovakengj?~|~translationMissing
I think she's the most dangerous of all of them.~|~translationMissing
She seems to be nothing more than a slightly senile dwarf with a love for sherry. If that's true, then she's not the kind of person who should be in charge of anything.~|~translationMissing
But maybe that's not who she really is. Maybe it's all just an act. If that's the case, then she's managed to fool everyone around her.~|~translationMissing
Either way, she's one to keep an eye on.~|~translationMissing
The biggest threat is the one you never see coming.~|~translationMissing
Exactly.~|~translationMissing
I'd better get going.~|~translationMissing
Any luck with the leaders?~|~translationMissing
Keep at it. We need to find a solution that they all agree on.~|~translationMissing
Leave me alone! I have nothing to say to you.~|~translationMissing
Hello Lord Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I was hoping you'd come and speak with me. There is much we need to discuss.~|~translationMissing
About the Council?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly. That revelation is concerning and needs to be addressed. However, I fear we may be facing a much larger issue.~|~translationMissing
When we spoke before, you mentioned that all of this had some connection to the death in Arceuus. Tell me, does that have anything to do with the mage you mentioned?~|~translationMissing
That's right. Xamphur was his name. I discovered his hideout in the Lizardman Temple below Molch.~|~translationMissing
He was the one responsible for the device that was redirecting power from the Dark Altar, but I'm not totally sure what he was using the power for. That recent earthquake was also involved somehow.~|~translationMissing
I see. And did this Xamphur look similar to an Arceuus citizen?~|~translationMissing
He did. How did you know that?~|~translationMissing
Xamphur is not a common name, and yet it is one I have heard before. During the Age of Strife, Xeric himself was assisted by a loyal servant of that same name.~|~translationMissing
You don't think it's the same person do you?~|~translationMissing
Once, we would never have considered it. However, a recent discovery you made yourself means it's a very real possibility.~|~translationMissing
The altar at Quidamortem.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Thanks to that altar, Xeric and his followers had access to the same power that keeps every citizen of Arceuus alive.~|~translationMissing
With that power, they may well have lived much longer than originally believed. It's possible one of them even lives to this day.~|~translationMissing
There's something else as well. When I found Xamphur, he wasn't alone. I think the other person was Veos. The weird thing is, Xamphur spoke as if Veos was his master.~|~translationMissing
This isn't exactly the first odd occurrence when it comes to Veos either. A while back I helped him with some strange client of his.~|~translationMissing
When we were done, this client spoke through Veos himself. The things he said were... strange.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. This is interesting and concerning. Perhaps this client is the one Xamphur considers his master.~|~translationMissing
But if Veos' client is Xamphur's master, and if Xamphur once served Xeric, could that mean...~|~translationMissing
Be careful, friend. Empty speculation will be of little help to us here.~|~translationMissing
But surely it's an option we should consider?~|~translationMissing
Of course. However, if you consider one option too closely, you'll become blind to all other possibilities. What we need here is proof.~|~translationMissing
And how do we get that?~|~translationMissing
My friend, I must ask that you once again to pay a visit to the Tasakaal at Mount Karuulm. With their power, they will be able to determine if this Xamphur is the same one that served Xeric.~|~translationMissing
The power of the Dark Altar leaves traces. If Xamphur's soul inhabits a body created using the Dark Altar, the Tasakaal will be able to determine when that body was formed.~|~translationMissing
Would they not need his body for that?~|~translationMissing
Ideally, but I suspect this will also work.~|~translationMissing
Lord Arceuus shows you the broken device that was redirecting power from the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
Since you destroyed it, we've been researching this device to try and determine the origin. Thanks to you, we now know that it was made by Xamphur.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll take the device to the Tasakaal and see what they can do with it. However, I also need to ask for your support with this new Royal Accord.~|~translationMissing
The Council must be removed and a replacement is needed. I will gladly support the new Royal Accord. But first, we must focus on Xamphur.~|~translationMissing
Lord Arceuus gives you the broken device.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll be back once I've discovered something from the Tasakaal.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Have you spoken with the Tasakaal?~|~translationMissing
Please do so soon. Only they have the power to determine who Xamphur is.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I'm guessing you want to discuss the Royal Accord?~|~translationMissing
That's right. I assume you won't have any issues supporting it, considering it was your idea?~|~translationMissing
It's a messy business, but the Council has to go. That means a replacement is needed. A new Royal Accord is our best hope for a peaceful transition of power.~|~translationMissing
Now, that said, there are some preparations I need to make before we finalise things. Perhaps you could help me with that.~|~translationMissing
Well if it gets things done faster, then I guess so.~|~translationMissing
As with the Royal Accord of Twill, our new accord will see power transferred to the five houses. However, only one of them will rule.~|~translationMissing
The Royal Accord of Twill saw each of the houses take it in turns to do this, but we may want to take a different approach this time.~|~translationMissing
I'm almost certain that Lord Arceuus and Lady Piscarilius will not wish to rule. Lady Lovakengj likely won't either. That leaves myself and Lord Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
And would you be willing to take on that role?~|~translationMissing
Well, that's where my preparations come in. While I can't say I'm too keen on ruling Kourend, I'm not sure if Lord Shayzien is the right man for the job either.~|~translationMissing
How come?~|~translationMissing
Take a look through the pages of Kourend's history and you'll soon see that soldiers do not make for good rulers.~|~translationMissing
As such, before any final decision is made, there's something I'd like to look into when it comes to Lord Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
As you probably won't be too surprised to hear, I have people who keep a close eye on things around Kourend. They let me know of any interesting occurrences that could impact Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
Not too long ago, I was informed that Lord Shayzien went for a private walk in the Kourend Woodland. While there, he stopped off at a small Barbarian Camp.~|~translationMissing
That's an interesting place for him to visit.~|~translationMissing
It is. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, but I'd like to be sure before we make any big decisions.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I can go and take a look around this camp.~|~translationMissing
That would be appreciated. It's directly south of here in the Kourend Woodland.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll let you know if I find anything.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Any luck with that barbarian camp?~|~translationMissing
Very well. Let me know if you discover anything. The camp is directly south of here in the Kourend Woodland.~|~translationMissing
Hello Lady Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's the human. Hello human.~|~translationMissing
I wanted to talk to you about this Royal Accord. Would you be willing to support it?~|~translationMissing
Royal Accord? Hmm...~|~translationMissing
No I don't think so.~|~translationMissing
Why not?~|~translationMissing
Why not what?~|~translationMissing
Why can't you support the new Royal Accord?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the new Royal Accord. Well Councillor Unkar has been a good dwarf his whole life. He can't be involved in any of this.~|~translationMissing
I know it's hard to hear, but I think he is.~|~translationMissing
No, no, no. That's not right at all. You must be getting confused somewhere. Councillor Andrews is the problem.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I know! We can replace Councillor Andrews with Councillor Unkar. What an excellent idea! This calls for a sherry.~|~translationMissing
Lady Lovakengj please, you have to believe me! Councillor Unkar isn't innocent in this.~|~translationMissing
Well you can't go believing Councillor Orson! He's clearly just jealous of Councillor Unkar's success.~|~translationMissing
Okay, well how about I find some proof that Councillor Unkar is involved? Then will you support the Royal Accord?~|~translationMissing
Oh... well I suppose so, but I don't think you'll find any. Councillor Unkar is innocent.~|~translationMissing
Right. Let me chat to Commander Fullore about this.~|~translationMissing
I'm still looking into things with Councillor Unkar. I'll let you know once I find something.~|~translationMissing
Okay human. I'm sure you'll soon see that Councillor Unkar is innocent.~|~translationMissing
We need to talk about this Royal Accord.~|~translationMissing
Don't waste your time. I will never sign that thing.~|~translationMissing
So you'd see the corrupt Council stay in charge?~|~translationMissing
Of course not, you fool. Did you not listen earlier? The people should decide, not us.~|~translationMissing
Well it seems like there's a clear solution to this then.~|~translationMissing
I doubt that.~|~translationMissing
For the Royal Accord to be finalised, we can have the people vote on it. That way, they get the final say.~|~translationMissing
It would still see us return to a single ruler.~|~translationMissing
Only if that's what people want. If they vote no, we come up with an alternative arrangement and let them vote on that instead.~|~translationMissing
Eugh.~|~translationMissing
Come on now. If you do care for the people, this is the best option.~|~translationMissing
Fine. It's still a stupid move, but if there's to be a vote, I might be willing to support it.~|~translationMissing
Might?~|~translationMissing
Yes. First, there's something else we need to discuss.~|~translationMissing
Of course there is.~|~translationMissing
While you've been running around chasing dead princesses and mad mages, you've forgotten what started all of this. You summoned a demon in my home!~|~translationMissing
No... I killed a demon that someone else summoned in your home. You should thank me.~|~translationMissing
Really? Thank you for being as useless as I feared.~|~translationMissing
How about we skip over the insults this time and you just tell me what you want.~|~translationMissing
The Disciples of Yama are a big problem. They need dealing with.~|~translationMissing
Tell Lord Shayzien to send the army in, then. They literally live right on his doorstep.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! They live on his doorstep and he cares more about stupid lizardmen. The man is clearly as incompetent as you.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. So it sounds like you want me to take on this cult singlehandedly? I feel like that won't go well.~|~translationMissing
Of course I don't expect you to take on an entire cult! What you need to do is cut the head off the snake. Remove the influence of their leader and they won't be a problem.~|~translationMissing
So, what? Kill Yama?~|~translationMissing
No. Yama has no presence among his followers. At least, not yet. If you remove their connection to him, he won't be able to communicate with them.~|~translationMissing
I know of a mage in Arceuus who's hopefully not as useless as you or Lord Shayzien. Her name is Mori and she's been investigating the Disciples of Yama. She should be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Woah! Slow down there. How do you know all of this?~|~translationMissing
Because I did some digging. Oddly enough I wasn't going to ignore a corrupt councillor summoning a demon on my docks.~|~translationMissing
You learnt all of this just with a bit of digging? There's something you're not telling me here. Besides, why would you care so much about this compared to everything else going on?~|~translationMissing
This conversation is pointless. If you want my support, this is the price. Now go and talk to Mori. I hear she spends most of her time in the Arceuus Church.~|~translationMissing
Fine. I'll be back later.~|~translationMissing
Have you spoken to Mori yet?~|~translationMissing
From what I hear, she spends most of her time in the Arceuus Church. Now clear off.~|~translationMissing
Ah, there you are citizen. There's something I need to discuss with you.~|~translationMissing
The Royal Accord?~|~translationMissing
Correct, citizen. Once the Council are removed from power, we will need a new ruler. I for one think this Royal Accord is the perfect move.~|~translationMissing
I think we can also agree that when the times comes, I will be a suitable candidate to rule. These are unstable times. My military leadership will put me in a good position to take over.~|~translationMissing
Do you think the other leaders will support that?~|~translationMissing
I've no doubt they'll consider me a strong contender. That said, I expect Lord Hosidius will also be considered. On that note, there's a job I have that would be perfect for one with your skills.~|~translationMissing
Before we come to finalise this Royal Accord, we need to be sure that everyone is in a place where they can pick the right ruler.~|~translationMissing
While Lord Hosidius seems like a good man for the job, I've recently obtained some intelligence that could suggest otherwise. I'd like you to look into this.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius? Interesting... What is this intelligence?~|~translationMissing
Some of my best people have been looking into the disappearance of Phileas Rimor and King Shayzien VII's journal. We now believe we have located both.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... Phileas Rimor?~|~translationMissing
That's right. Is there a problem, citizen?~|~translationMissing
Well... no. Sorry, carry on.~|~translationMissing
Very well... I will personally see to the rescue of Phileas. I need you to recover the journal.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... I thought this was about Lord Hosidius?~|~translationMissing
That it is, citizen. If our intelligence is to be believed, Lord Hosidius is now in possession of the journal.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't make sense! Why would Lord Hosidius want that journal?~|~translationMissing
That I don't know, citizen. Lord Hosidius is meant to be an ally to Shayzien. After all, he's married to my sister.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps this is some plot of his to grow his influence. He may wish to use the journal to discredit my family. Regardless, I need you to retrieve it. Only then will we be able to determine the truth.~|~translationMissing
This is all very odd. Do you know where he keeps the journal?~|~translationMissing
Apparently he has a private office hidden below the Hosidius Vinery. That will likely be where he's keeping it. You'll need to go there, find out how to enter this office and then recover the journal.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll let you know what I find.~|~translationMissing
Hello there citizen. Have you found that journal?~|~translationMissing
It's critical that you do so, as soon as possible. It will likely be in Lord Hosidius' hidden office below the Hosidius Vinery.~|~translationMissing
Kaal-Mej-San~|~translationMissing
The human returns.~|~translationMissing
Kaal-Xil-Dar~|~translationMissing
And needs our help again.~|~translationMissing
How do you know that?~|~translationMissing
Kaal-Ket-Jor~|~translationMissing
It is our place to know.~|~translationMissing
Come human.~|~translationMissing
Tell us what you desire.~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you could take a look at this device and tell me more about the person that made it.~|~translationMissing
Why?~|~translationMissing
Why what?~|~translationMissing
Why should we help?~|~translationMissing
Because this device is the thing that was redirecting power from the Dark Altar. The person who made it was also responsible for the trapped soul that needed freeing.~|~translationMissing
The meddling mortal.~|~translationMissing
You have our attention.~|~translationMissing
And so we shall help you.~|~translationMissing
Hold still.~|~translationMissing
And we will begin.~|~translationMissing
You feel a strange sensation as the Tasakaal magically inspect the device.~|~translationMissing
Many have touched this device.~|~translationMissing
Humans.~|~translationMissing
Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
And two others.~|~translationMissing
Two others?~|~translationMissing
One touched by fire.~|~translationMissing
And one touched by darkness.~|~translationMissing
Darkness? That sounds like Xamphur. Can you tell how old he is?~|~translationMissing
His body was born long ago.~|~translationMissing
In the time of the great betrayer.~|~translationMissing
Great betrayer? Do you mean Xeric?~|~translationMissing
Do not speak that name.~|~translationMissing
It has no place here.~|~translationMissing
You know of him?~|~translationMissing
We know all too well.~|~translationMissing
But is that who you speak of?~|~translationMissing
So Lord Arceuus was right. What of this other person, the one touched by fire?~|~translationMissing
They are one of many.~|~translationMissing
Once born of Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Now a child of fire.~|~translationMissing
A Pyromancer? Xamphur is working with a Pyromancer?~|~translationMissing
Hang on... I recently helped to repair some damage to the Doors of Dinh. What if this Pyromancer was the one responsible?~|~translationMissing
Impossible to say.~|~translationMissing
But a coincidence is unlikely.~|~translationMissing
Well then what's to stop them doing it again? We have to do something!~|~translationMissing
We?~|~translationMissing
We have no part in this.~|~translationMissing
We have already helped you.~|~translationMissing
Keeping the balance between life and death. That's your thing isn't it? If the Wintertodt escapes, it will destroy all life in Kourend. That doesn't seem very balanced!~|~translationMissing
The human makes a valid point.~|~translationMissing
Well it's been known to happen.~|~translationMissing
Very well.~|~translationMissing
The Dark Altar powers the Doors of Dinh.~|~translationMissing
We understand this power.~|~translationMissing
We can help reinforce them.~|~translationMissing
To prevent further sabotage.~|~translationMissing
Take a defence potion.~|~translationMissing
Add some volcanic sulphur.~|~translationMissing
Then return to us.~|~translationMissing
And we will enchant it.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get volcanic sulphur?~|~translationMissing
It can be mined in Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
Got it. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Sulphur in a defence potion. Got it. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
What am I meant to be doing again?~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
I have the potion.~|~translationMissing
Then hold still.~|~translationMissing
You feel a strange sensation as the Tasakaal enchant the potion.~|~translationMissing
It is done.~|~translationMissing
Now take the potion.~|~translationMissing
Pour it on the Doors of Dinh.~|~translationMissing
And your work will be done.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll get it sorted.~|~translationMissing
Take your potion.~|~translationMissing
I lost the potion.~|~translationMissing
You are lucky.~|~translationMissing
We prepared for such an outcome.~|~translationMissing
You feel a strange sensation as the Tasakaal replace your potion.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll get it sorted.~|~translationMissing
Well that's that done. I'd better get back to Lord Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Ignisia~|~translationMissing
Hey! What are you doing with those doors?~|~translationMissing
Nothing...~|~translationMissing
Well you can either go through them or leave them alone.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll leave them alone...~|~translationMissing
I have. They confirmed that this Xamphur is the same one that served Xeric.~|~translationMissing
So it's as I feared. This is not good.~|~translationMissing
There's more. We discovered that Xamphur has been working with a Pyromancer. That means he may have been involved in the sabotage of the Doors of Dinh.~|~translationMissing
A Pyromancer? Do you know who?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure about this? Had the Doors of Dinh fully failed, the Wintertodt would have destroyed Kourend. What would Xamphur gain from that?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, but the Tasakaal themselves confirmed it.~|~translationMissing
I will have someone look into this. We'll also use this new knowledge to try and locate Xamphur.~|~translationMissing
His master said they'd meet again in the south.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. This is useful information that could help our search. I wonder... could they mean the southern Kingdom of Varlamore?~|~translationMissing
Ah, but that's one for another time. I believe we've learnt all we can about Xamphur for now. Until we can locate him, we must turn our focus towards the Council.~|~translationMissing
So you'll support the new Royal Accord?~|~translationMissing
I will. While I have no desire to rule myself, I'll gladly support one of my fellow leaders in that role.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I'd better go and speak with the others.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. You have my support with the Royal Accord. You should speak with the others.~|~translationMissing
Phileas Rimor~|~translationMissing
Adventurer! You came!~|~translationMissing
Phileas?~|~translationMissing
Barbarian Warlord~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't be here! Time to die!~|~translationMissing
You came for me! I knew you would!~|~translationMissing
I don't understand Phileas. Why are you here?~|~translationMissing
These barbarians raided my home! They took me prisoner. I thought they were going to kill me!~|~translationMissing
But why?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I heard one of them saying they'd been paid to do it. But who would pay to have me captured?~|~translationMissing
Wait! What about that parcel? The one with King Shayzien VII's journal. Do you have it?~|~translationMissing
No. They took it from me. You don't think that's what this was about, do you?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure, but I don't like this at all. I need to speak with Lord Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius? What's he got to do with this? And what about me?~|~translationMissing
There's too much to explain right now. Now, there are a lot of barbarians outside, so I can't free you at the moment. I'll go get help. Don't worry, you'll be safe soon.~|~translationMissing
Alright. But please, don't take long.~|~translationMissing
Is it safe to free me yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I need to go and speak to Lord Hosidius. Don't worry, you'll be safe soon.~|~translationMissing
We need to get some people down there urgently! The barbarians have Phileas Rimor prisoner.~|~translationMissing
Phileas Rimor? Who's Phileas Rimor?~|~translationMissing
He's a retired soldier from Shayzien. I helped him out with something a while ago, but he went missing. Turns out these barbarians were paid to take him.~|~translationMissing
Paid by whom?~|~translationMissing
I don't know for sure, but I doubt Lord Shayzien's visit was a coincidence.~|~translationMissing
So, it's as I feared. Still, that doesn't explain why Lord Shayzien would pay for one of his own citizens to be captured.~|~translationMissing
The thing I was helping Phileas with involved a mysterious parcel he'd received. The parcel contained King Shayzien VII's journal. When Phileas was captured, it was taken by the barbarians.~|~translationMissing
Before that happened, I followed some clues in the journal. They eventually led me to the discovery that King Shayzien VII may have been responsible for the creation of the lizardmen.~|~translationMissing
Ah, the discovery at Quidamortem. This is all starting to make sense. It's long been believed that King Shayzien VII eventually became Xeric. That discovery did little to suggest otherwise.~|~translationMissing
Lord Shayzien wouldn't have been too happy of further evidence that Xeric was part of his family. He must have made arrangements to hide as much of that evidence as possible.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, friend. I think we have all the information we need. I'll have some of my people head to this camp. They'll ensure Phileas is safe.~|~translationMissing
It's probably best he disappear for a while, for his own safety. I'll make the arrangements.~|~translationMissing
What of Lord Shayzien?~|~translationMissing
For now, nothing. We should keep this information to ourselves, until the time is right. As for the Royal Accord, I am ready to finalise things when you are.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I guess I'd better go and speak with the others.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Thank you for your help earlier. You'll be pleased to know that Phileas is now safe.~|~translationMissing
That's good to hear. Thank you for taking care of him. I'd better go and speak with the others.~|~translationMissing
I need some help with Lady Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
She doesn't believe that Councillor Unkar has anything to do with this. She wants proof he's involved before she signs the new Royal Accord.~|~translationMissing
That's not too suprising. The two of them are old friends. I've got nothing on him, but I can think of one person who might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Martin?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. His group has no doubt kept tabs on all of the councillors.~|~translationMissing
But he's been arrested. I can't just go and break him out.~|~translationMissing
No, but you can still talk to him. You've helped the Council enough that no one would think much of it if you paid him a visit.~|~translationMissing
Fair point, I suppose. If anyone asks, I can claim I'm trying to round up more of his group.~|~translationMissing
Nice idea. They took him to the Shayzien Prison, just west of the city.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll go and see what he knows.~|~translationMissing
I wanted to ask you something about the leaders.~|~translationMissing
Go ahead.~|~translationMissing
Have you spoken to Martin? He's in the Shayzien Prison, just west of the city.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and see what he knows.~|~translationMissing
Martin!~|~translationMissing
Guard~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I can't let you talk to the prisoners.~|~translationMissing
But I'm here on Council business. I need to learn more about his group.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes! You're the one that helped with Councillor Hughes. Carry on then.~|~translationMissing
How are things Martin?~|~translationMissing
Oh wonderful! There's free food and a bed! Can you believe it? Luxury compared to anything in Port Piscarilius!~|~translationMissing
Well I'm glad you're keeping your spirits up. Now, I need your help with something.~|~translationMissing
Of course. Right down to business. As you can see, I'm a little indisposed right now. Apparently the right to protest isn't so much of a right after all.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, it's just information I need. Things have progressed with the Council. I can't say any more here, but we're close. However, I need information on Councillor Unkar.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work my friend! From the moment I met you, I knew you were something special. Now, what information do you need on him?~|~translationMissing
Anything that could prove his corruption.~|~translationMissing
If I had information on his corruption, I might not be stood in a cell right now.~|~translationMissing
Of course, but you must have something on him. Anything could be helpful at this point.~|~translationMissing
I see. Well, there's a member of the Royal Society who has close access to Councillor Unkar's dealings. He gives me regular reports, but there hasn't been anything of note yet.~|~translationMissing
Still, things have progressed fast recently. Maybe he's had more luck since my imprisonment. As I'm stuck in here, perhaps you should go on my behalf to our usual meeting.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like a plan. Where does this meeting take place?~|~translationMissing
In the Shayzien Graveyard of Heroes. Look for a dwarf. He'll speak with you if you say the passphrase~|~translationMissing
'Evil only triumphs when the good do nothing.'~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the help, Martin. We'll have you out of there soon.~|~translationMissing
Good luck friend. Finish this for all of us!~|~translationMissing
Hello again, Martin. Remind me, where is this meeting?~|~translationMissing
That was it. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Not a problem. Now get out there and finish this!~|~translationMissing
I know you! You're Jorra, Lady Lovakengj's assistant.~|~translationMissing
That's right. What brings you here, human?~|~translationMissing
Err...~|~translationMissing
The evening owl doesn't eat much pudding.~|~translationMissing
I don't know.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should go and lie down.~|~translationMissing
Evil only triumphs when the good do nothing.~|~translationMissing
Never have truer words been spoken. Martin sent you, right? I wasn't sure if anyone would come after he got arrested.~|~translationMissing
That's right. So you're with the Royal Society? How come?~|~translationMissing
Why wouldn't I be? The Council are nothing but trouble.~|~translationMissing
But things don't seem too bad in Lovakengj with them in charge.~|~translationMissing
Lady Lovakengj is in charge of Lovakengj, not the Council. Sure, Councillor Unkar might act like he plays a big part, but it's all empty words.~|~translationMissing
Do you not get sick of her asking for sherry?~|~translationMissing
Not really. It's not like it's a hard job. Councillor Unkar would see us all work to death in the mines instead.~|~translationMissing
I see. Well Councillor Unkar is why I'm here. I'm hoping you can give me something of note on him.~|~translationMissing
Any other day you'd be wasting your time, but today you're in luck. Due to the protests, Councillor Unkar has been staying at the castle for safety. I've had a chance to go through his private documents.~|~translationMissing
I think you'll find...~|~translationMissing
Wait! What was that?~|~translationMissing
Oh no. Not again!~|~translationMissing
Jorra Ashtar. You have been marked for death.~|~translationMissing
If tomorrow never comes, what is today?~|~translationMissing
Nothing.~|~translationMissing
Huh... Fair enough.~|~translationMissing
That was close! Are you okay human?~|~translationMissing
Martin warned me this would happen. The Council are trying to silence us!~|~translationMissing
It's not safe for me here. I need to get back to Lovakengj. Here, this should hopefully give you what you need.~|~translationMissing
Jorra gives you a declaration from the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Jorra. Stay safe.~|~translationMissing
You have what you need human. Now I need to get back to Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
I have a declaration from the Council that I think you should see.~|~translationMissing
You show the declaration to Lady Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
What? But... I don't understand.~|~translationMissing
The Council wanted to remove me from power? They can't do that! It's not their right!~|~translationMissing
And Councillor Unkar...~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry. Do you now see why we need to stop them?~|~translationMissing
Yes... I understand. I will support this Royal Accord.~|~translationMissing
And do you wish to be considered for the throne?~|~translationMissing
Oh... No. Leave that for someone else.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Thank you Lady Lovakengj. I'd better go and speak with the others.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else I can do for you?~|~translationMissing
Oh... Let's see now...~|~translationMissing
Do you have any sherry?~|~translationMissing
Sherry? No.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Well I'm fine then.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. I'll go speak with the others.~|~translationMissing
Hello Mori.~|~translationMissing
Mori~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Thank you for everything you did for Thana. You are a good friend to the people of Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
It's not a problem. Anyway, there was something I was hoping you could help me with.~|~translationMissing
Of course. What do you need?~|~translationMissing
I have a situation with the Disciples of Yama. I hear you've been looking into them.~|~translationMissing
Well... Yes, I have, but that research was meant to be a secret...~|~translationMissing
Ah well, you're trustworthy I suppose. What can I help you with?~|~translationMissing
What do you know of their leader, Yama?~|~translationMissing
He's a bit of a mystery. He's a demon of some sorts, but he doesn't seem to have any actual presence in Kourend yet. In fact, until recently, he had no connection to the cult.~|~translationMissing
The Disciples of Yama once had no connection to Yama?~|~translationMissing
It does sound odd, but back then they were known as the Disciples of Chaos. They were just a small Zamorakian cult of little note.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. So if Yama has no presence among his followers, how does he communicate with them?~|~translationMissing
Through another demon called the Voice of Yama.~|~translationMissing
So if I killed this Voice of Yama, the cultists would lose their connection to Yama?~|~translationMissing
For a time, though I imagine the Voice of Yama would be quickly replaced. However, if you wanted to remove that connection, I do have another idea...~|~translationMissing
After what happened with Thana, I volunteered to help out with the Dark Altar investigations. The device used there was redirecting power from the Altar, but a similar device could block a magical connection entirely.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. So we could use a device like that to block the connection between the Voice of Yama and Yama himself?~|~translationMissing
That's right. We never tried it before because the Dark Altar issues were more pressing, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.~|~translationMissing
Alright. So where can I get one of these devices?~|~translationMissing
I should be able to make you one. I'll need some molten glass and a dark essence block.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the required materials~|~translationMissing
I have those right here.~|~translationMissing
You give Mori some molten glass and a dark essence block.~|~translationMissing
Right. You'll need to hide this somewhere in the Chasm of Fire. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
Mori gives you a Dark Nullifier.~|~translationMissing
Alright. Thanks Mori.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the required materials~|~translationMissing
Where can I get a dark essence block?~|~translationMissing
You can mine dense essence blocks from the mine north east of here. They can be turned into dark essence blocks using the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll come back once I have what you need.~|~translationMissing
I can get those for you. I'll come back once I have them.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Do you have some molten glass and a dark essence block yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'll come back once I have them.~|~translationMissing
I have them right here.~|~translationMissing
Hello Mori. What should I be doing with this device?~|~translationMissing
You just need to hide it somewhere in the Chasm of Fire.~|~translationMissing
Hello Mori. Do you think you could make me another one of those devices?~|~translationMissing
I have enough supplies for another. Here, you'll need to hide it somewhere in the Chasm of Fire.~|~translationMissing
Ah, there you are. Our master foresaw your arrival.~|~translationMissing
And you have the device as well. How wonderful.~|~translationMissing
How do you...~|~translationMissing
You suddenly find yourself feeling very tired.~|~translationMissing
Oh look at you. You need a good rest. Here, have a lie down.~|~translationMissing
You feel your eyes closing...~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to black.~|~translationMissing
You wake up in the forest.~|~translationMissing
Well that's the device hidden. Those Disciples of Yama won't be a problem anymore. I'd better tell Lady Piscarilius.~|~translationMissing
Have you dealt with the Disciples of Yama yet?~|~translationMissing
It's all done.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely. They won't be a problem anymore.~|~translationMissing
Good.~|~translationMissing
So will you now support this Royal Accord?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but it's still a stupid idea. And don't even think about trying to put me in charge or something. I'll have no more part in this.~|~translationMissing
I don't think you need to worry about that. Now, I'd better go and speak with the others.~|~translationMissing
Good. I've had enough of talking with you.~|~translationMissing
Clear off then.~|~translationMissing
Fine. I need to speak with the others anyway.~|~translationMissing
I hear your father has an office here.~|~translationMissing
Pandur Hosidius~|~translationMissing
Office? What office?~|~translationMissing
A secret one, I'm guessing?~|~translationMissing
There can't be any secret offices here. I'd have noticed. I notice lots of things, you know.~|~translationMissing
Well in that case, have you noticed your father doing anything interesting here in the past?~|~translationMissing
He sometimes comes to inspect the wine barrels. I like to inspect them myself sometimes.~|~translationMissing
More than inspect, by the looks of things. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
You're welcome.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What are these farming patches for?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you been drinking?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll leave you to it.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, citizen. Have you found that journal?~|~translationMissing
You show the journal to Lord Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work.~|~translationMissing
It's sealed shut somehow.~|~translationMissing
Not to worry, I should be able to take care of that. When the time comes to finalise the Royal Accord, I will have the information we need to decide upon a new ruler.~|~translationMissing
Alright. Thank you, Lord Shayzien. I should speak to Commander Fullore.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, citizen. Thank you for your help earlier. I am ready to support this Royal Accord!~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll go and talk with Commander Fullore.~|~translationMissing
Come with me. There's something you need to see.~|~translationMissing
Just come.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. Commander Fullore and the player discover Councillor Orson has died outside Xeric's Lookout.~|~translationMissing
What the... Is he...?~|~translationMissing
Yup.~|~translationMissing
What happened? Did he jump?~|~translationMissing
I've no idea.~|~translationMissing
You don't think he was pushed, do you?~|~translationMissing
What do we do now?~|~translationMissing
What can we do? Even Lord Arceuus can't bring back the dead. He's gone, and that's that.~|~translationMissing
Why did any of this have to happen?~|~translationMissing
We can't undo what's been done, but we can still put an end to all this.~|~translationMissing
Does that mean you have good news?~|~translationMissing
Kind of. I think I've managed to convince all the leaders to sign the Accord. That said, I have no idea who they'll pick to rule.~|~translationMissing
Well, we'll just have to make it work somehow. Maybe then we can finally end this nightmare.~|~translationMissing
I'll deal with this mess. Once I'm done, let's gather everyone downstairs again.~|~translationMissing
The scene transitions to the basement, where the leaders of the five Houses, bar Hosidius and Shayzien, appear.~|~translationMissing
Shall we get on with this then?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. Where's Lord Hosidius and Lord Shayzien?~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius requested a private word with Lord Shayzien outside. I'm sure they'll be here soon.~|~translationMissing
In fact, I think I hear them now.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius and Shayzien arrive to the meeting.~|~translationMissing
Now that everyone is here, I think we can begin.~|~translationMissing
What of the Councillor? Is he not joining us?~|~translationMissing
Councillor Orson is dead.~|~translationMissing
Dead? What happened?~|~translationMissing
Jumped from the top of the tower, probably. It doesn't matter, the world won't miss him. Let's move on.~|~translationMissing
Not the attitude I'd take, but it's true that we can't dwell on this. We need to focus on stopping Councillor Andrews.~|~translationMissing
Between the five of us, we can remove the Council from power with little violence. But what then? Are we willing to support a new Royal Accord?~|~translationMissing
Lord Arceuus, let's start with you. What will it take for a new Royal Accord to gain your support?~|~translationMissing
My position is a unique one. As such, I feel it would be inappropriate for me to involve myself too heavily in this. That said, I will gladly support the decision made by this group.~|~translationMissing
You would not wish to rule yourself?~|~translationMissing
I will gladly advise the next ruler in any way I can, but it should not be me who takes the throne. I would recommend you look to Lord Hosidius or Lord Shayzien for that.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Lady Piscarilius?~|~translationMissing
For the record, I think this is all a bad idea. Still, you're all clearly set on it, so I won't try and stop you.~|~translationMissing
However, I stand by what I said before. The people should have a say. Anything we decide here should not be finalised until the people have voted on it.~|~translationMissing
Any thoughts from anyone?~|~translationMissing
I would be happy to see the people have a say.~|~translationMissing
It could be a risky move.~|~translationMissing
And? Without it, I'm not signing your precious document. If I don't sign, you get nothing.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Very well.~|~translationMissing
Assuming the people agree to the new Accord, who do you think should rule the kingdom?~|~translationMissing
Well not me, that's for sure. I can't imagine anything worse. Get one of these fools to do it.~|~translationMissing
Lady Lovakengj?~|~translationMissing
Huh? Me?~|~translationMissing
Yes. What do you think?~|~translationMissing
Well... This is all quite something. I suppose the Council have to go though, don't they?~|~translationMissing
Would you be willing to take over?~|~translationMissing
Oh... No, I don't think so. I think I'll have a sherry instead.~|~translationMissing
Lord Shayzien. What are your thoughts?~|~translationMissing
Well... I think the Royal Accord of Twill is a good starting point, but we'll need to make some changes for it to work.~|~translationMissing
Like what?~|~translationMissing
Lady Piscarilius wants the support of the people. Right now, they cry for a king. That means whoever takes the throne should take on the title of king or queen.~|~translationMissing
I also feel the act of transferring rulership from one house to the next - as in the original Accord - isn't going to work for us. What we need is consistency.~|~translationMissing
Would you be open to taking on the role yourself?~|~translationMissing
Err... No, I don't think that would be wise.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? You seem to be a perfect candidate.~|~translationMissing
I don't feel I would be best placed for it. It would be better if I kept my focus on the important task of protecting Kourend.~|~translationMissing
I suggest we make Lord Hosidius the new ruler of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius?~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Lord Shayzien. Taking the throne is not a duty to be considered lightly, but I believe my family and I have what it takes to shoulder this responsibility.~|~translationMissing
This decision will forever change the future of Kourend. If we go forward with this, the Hosidius family will be the new royal family of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Well... This isn't quite what I expected, but sure. Let the idiot have his throne. As long as the people agree.~|~translationMissing
He can do it, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius would be a fitting choice for the role, assuming no one else here is willing.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure about this Lord Shayzien?~|~translationMissing
I... I am.~|~translationMissing
Then it sounds like we have an agreement.~|~translationMissing
My friends, thank you for putting your trust in me. This kingdom has suffered through much of late, but now it is time for that suffering to end.~|~translationMissing
In honour of her sacrifice, I name this declaration Rose's Accord. With it, the Kingdom of Great Kourend will no longer be a kingdom divided.~|~translationMissing
I promise not to let you down.~|~translationMissing
So... What just happened there?~|~translationMissing
It seems we might have a new king.~|~translationMissing
But Lord Shayzien? He seemed like a perfect candidate, but he didn't even want to be considered. What happened?~|~translationMissing
I think I might have some idea, but I'm still a bit confused to be honest.~|~translationMissing
Well, Lord Hosidius wants to have a word with you. Perhaps he can shed some light on all of this. He's downstairs.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and speak to him.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. No doubt you have questions about what just occurred.~|~translationMissing
You can say that again!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark, my friend. It wasn't anything against you. I just couldn't afford to take any risks.~|~translationMissing
You planned this all along, didn't you? That's why you kept the Royal Accord of Twill.~|~translationMissing
It was inevitable that one day the Council would fall. Their rule has always been fragile.~|~translationMissing
So you made sure that you'd be the one to replace them.~|~translationMissing
It gives me no pleasure, but this was needed for the safety of all of Kourend. Apart from Lord Shayzien, the other rulers had no interest in the throne. It was always going to be him or me.~|~translationMissing
And you didn't want it to be him?~|~translationMissing
It was for the safety of Kourend. Lord Shayzien has a good military mind, but he is no ruler. After all, you saw what he did with Phileas.~|~translationMissing
To Lord Shayzien, family name is everything. Above all else, he craves glory for himself and his house. Under him, war would have been inevitable.~|~translationMissing
War with who?~|~translationMissing
Varlamore, the kingdom to the south. Our two kingdoms were in conflict less than a hundred years ago, and relations remain sour. It would take very little for that conflict to be reignited.~|~translationMissing
You really think Lord Shayzien would have declared war?~|~translationMissing
I can't say for sure, but it was a risk I did not intend to take.~|~translationMissing
I see. So how did you do it?~|~translationMissing
A while ago, I managed to acquire the old journal of King Shayzien VII. I knew that I could use it to discredit Lord Shayzien and his family, so I made some arrangements.~|~translationMissing
Phileas' mystery parcel! That was you? You acted like you didn't even know him earlier!~|~translationMissing
Apologies for the misdirection. It was indeed me who sent that parcel.~|~translationMissing
Had I revealed the contents of the journal myself, I would likely have just been dismissed as trying to create a rift between our two houses. Phileas was the perfect third party.~|~translationMissing
But then Lord Shayzien had Phileas captured before he could reveal too much. This is all starting to make sense. You know, he actually blamed you for that!~|~translationMissing
Phileas' disappearance was an interesting twist. I hadn't expected something like that. Still, it actually made things even easier in the end. Once Phileas was safe, I told Lord Shayzien and gave him a choice.~|~translationMissing
Oh I see. You let him pick between supporting you or being exposed.~|~translationMissing
Exactly. The truth about Phileas would have lost him the support of his people and ruined his reputation.~|~translationMissing
So in the end, you never actually needed to discredit him at all. What about the journal? Lord Shayzien sent me to steal it from you, but surely he already had it.~|~translationMissing
I didn't want to risk losing the real journal. The one I sent to Phileas was a copy, with many bits removed. While I covered my tracks well, Lord Shayzien must have worked out I was involved.~|~translationMissing
And he sent me to recover the real journal.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Unfortunately for him, the one you stole was a fake. The real one is somewhere much safer.~|~translationMissing
You really thought of everything didn't you? How about the Accord? That was essential to your plans. I'm guessing it was no accident that Artur found it.~|~translationMissing
I can't take too much credit from Artur there. He did do most of the work himself. I'd been looking into the Accord for a while when Artur found my research.~|~translationMissing
When he went missing, I feared the worst. It was a nice surprise when you not only brought him back, but the Accord as well.~|~translationMissing
This is a lot to take in. I don't know if I like any of it.~|~translationMissing
Nor do I like it myself. However, when it comes to politics, there are no perfect options. Instead, all we can do is pick the best option we have.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, we will have plenty of time to discuss this later. For now, the Council needs to be dealt with. You should speak with Commander Fullore.~|~translationMissing
We will have to talk more later my friend. For now, the Council needs to be dealt with. You should speak with Commander Fullore.~|~translationMissing
Alright.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. It's time for us to deal with the Council. You should speak with Commander Fullore.~|~translationMissing
Will do. I just need to talk to Lord Hosidius first.~|~translationMissing
Lord Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
Ah... Hello there citizen.~|~translationMissing
What happened there? Why didn't you put yourself forward to become king?~|~translationMissing
Well... It was a complex choice, citizen. I wouldn't worry about it. We're all ready to deal with the Council. Let's focus on that.~|~translationMissing
Okay...~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's the human. Shouldn't you be speaking with Commander Fullore?~|~translationMissing
Actually I need to go talk to Lord Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
I guess so.~|~translationMissing
Fine. I need to speak with Lord Hosidius anyway.~|~translationMissing
Fine. I need to speak with Commander Fullore anyway.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius wants to have a word with you. He's downstairs.~|~translationMissing
How did your chat with Lord Hosidius go?~|~translationMissing
It was definitely illuminating. It seems there was only ever really one option for Kourend's new ruler.~|~translationMissing
We'll have to talk about that later. It's time to pay a visit to the Council.~|~translationMissing
How are we doing this?~|~translationMissing
We'll join the five leaders and head to the castle. There, we'll tell the councillors everything we know and present Rose's Accord to them.~|~translationMissing
Do you think they'll come quietly?~|~translationMissing
They won't have a choice. Lord Shayzien commands the Shayzien Army, and I command the Royal Guard. They'll have no one to protect them.~|~translationMissing
What happens then?~|~translationMissing
They'll be imprisoned. It will be for the new ruler to decide their fates. As for that, we'll aim to hold the vote Lady Piscarilius requested as soon as possible.~|~translationMissing
Assuming the people support Rose's Accord, we can have Lord Hosidius crowned within a few days.~|~translationMissing
Do you think they'll support it?~|~translationMissing
I think so. Many are already calling out for a king, and Lord Hosidius is popular across the whole kingdom.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like we have everything covered, then. When do we depart?~|~translationMissing
As soon as you're ready. From what I hear, the protest is getting close to breaking point. We can't waste any more time.~|~translationMissing
Let's do this.~|~translationMissing
(Same as below)~|~translationMissing
I need to do something first.~|~translationMissing
Ready to pay the Council a visit?~|~translationMissing
Captain Rachelle~|~translationMissing
Hold the line! Under no circumstances can this castle be breached!~|~translationMissing
But Captain... They're citizens...~|~translationMissing
Did you not hear me? Hold the line!~|~translationMissing
Protester~|~translationMissing
That's right, hold the line! Show everyone who you really serve!~|~translationMissing
We serve Great Kourend! You are all in violation of the laws of this kingdom!~|~translationMissing
Laws set by your false Council! If you really served Kourend, you wouldn't be here defending those monsters!~|~translationMissing
Step back citizen!~|~translationMissing
Or what? You'll kill me? Go on! I dare you to do it! See what happens!~|~translationMissing
Yeah! You can't kill us all!~|~translationMissing
Stand back! I'm warning you!~|~translationMissing
Lord Shayzien, Lord Hosidius, Commander Fullore, and the player arrive at Kourend Castle.~|~translationMissing
Stand down, Captain Rachelle. This situation is now under my command.~|~translationMissing
Lord Shayzien? What's going on?~|~translationMissing
These citizens are to be protected. Ensure they do not enter the castle, but do not allow any harm to come to them.~|~translationMissing
As you wish, Lord Shayzien. It will be done.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Captain. Now, myself and the other leaders will go and speak with the councillors. This situation will be resolved soon.~|~translationMissing
The scene transitions to the leaders of the five Houses meeting with Councillor Andrews.~|~translationMissing
Ah, Lord Shayzien. It's good to have you here. Hopefully with your support we can get this protest under control.~|~translationMissing
Though I must say, I'm a bit confused as to why everyone else is here. Is something happening?~|~translationMissing
That would be one way to describe it Councillor. Lord Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Andrews, Councillor Unkar. We are here to present a joint declaration from the five houses of Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Declaration? I don't understand.~|~translationMissing
We, the leaders of the five houses of Great Kourend, declare that the Kourend Council is no longer fit to rule. As such, you are relieved of your positions with immediate effect.~|~translationMissing
What the... What is this?~|~translationMissing
Furthermore, you will both hand yourselves over to Lord Shayzien's soldiers. They will take you into custody where you will await your trial.~|~translationMissing
Trial? Have you gone mad? Trial for what?~|~translationMissing
For the crimes of murder and high treason. Along with the now-deceased Liam Orson and Sophia Hughes, the two of you successfully conspired to murder King Kharedst IV and Crown Princess Rose.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Unkar~|~translationMissing
Liam's... dead?~|~translationMissing
This is insanity! Guards! Arrest them at once!~|~translationMissing
Soldiers of the Kourend Royal Guard, you serve the rightful ruler of Kourend! That is not this man. Stand down and step aside!~|~translationMissing
The royal guards leave.~|~translationMissing
No! You can't do this!~|~translationMissing
David... It's over...~|~translationMissing
Over? Only I decide when it's over! I am the rightful ruler of this kingdom and you all answer to me!~|~translationMissing
Guards.~|~translationMissing
Stay away from me! This is my throne! I worked too hard for you to just take it away! I'd rather die!~|~translationMissing
Do it.~|~translationMissing
No!~|~translationMissing
The guards knock out Councillor Andrews.~|~translationMissing
Take them away.~|~translationMissing
Don't take too long. Let me know when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
The cutscene transitions from Councillor Andrews's arrest to the Kourend Castle Courtyard. Here, a big banquet has been laid out in the courtyard. Attendees include the leaders of the five Houses bar Lord Shayzien, the Hosidius family, Martin Holt, Captain Ginea, Commander Fullore, Duke Horacio, Queen Ellamaria, King Roald, Sir Amik Varze, Sir Tiffy Cashien, King Lathas/Thoros, Queen Zyanyi Arkan, and her royal guards, the Kualti.~|~translationMissing
Well, look who it is!~|~translationMissing
Good to see you Martin.~|~translationMissing
Can you believe it? The coronation of a king! Truth be told, there were times I wondered if this day would ever come.~|~translationMissing
And is it everything you hoped for?~|~translationMissing
Everything and more, my friend. And to think they even let us vote on it as well! Fantastic!~|~translationMissing
Well the King certainly seems to have attracted plenty of guests.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Seems that everyone wants to congratulate him... Or maybe they're just here for the food.~|~translationMissing
Either way, this will be an event for the ages.~|~translationMissing
Are all the leaders here as well?~|~translationMissing
Most of them. Lord Shayzien was here earlier but he left. To be honest, he didn't look to be enjoying himself.~|~translationMissing
That's not too suprising. Things weren't exactly straightforward between him and the King when this was all arranged.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I heard there was a bit of drama here and there. Still, that's Kourend for you.~|~translationMissing
Now, I'll let you go and mingle. I'm sure the King himself will want a word with you at some point as well.~|~translationMissing
Alright. Have fun Martin.~|~translationMissing
The player walks towards Lord Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you friend.~|~translationMissing
Any word on Xamphur?~|~translationMissing
Nothing yet. However, we did manage to search his lair in Molch.~|~translationMissing
Find anything interesting?~|~translationMissing
Most of it had been cleared out before we arrived. There was some research left behind though. Notes on potential new spells.~|~translationMissing
Some are far too dangerous to use, but others we've found to be safe. We're preparing a tome of all the ones that are suitable. I'll make sure you get a copy once we're done.~|~translationMissing
That's very kind of you.~|~translationMissing
It's the least we can do after all you have done for us. Anyway, I won't keep you. Enjoy the coronation.~|~translationMissing
The player walks towards Commander Fullore.~|~translationMissing
There you are! I was worried you'd miss all the fun.~|~translationMissing
No chance. It's not every day you crown a new king.~|~translationMissing
You can say that again. You should have seen all the preperations needed. Food, drinks, entertainment, invitations... The list goes on.~|~translationMissing
You'd think security would be one of the hard parts, but I actually reckon our bit is pretty straightforward in comparison.~|~translationMissing
On that note, how does it feel to be serving a king now?~|~translationMissing
I don't think it's quite sunk in yet. It still feels like it was only this morning that Councillor Hughes escaped. So much has happened in such a short time.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about it. Had I known how this would go when Martin first recruited me, I'd have probably considered running for the hills as fast as possible.~|~translationMissing
Well, I for one am glad you didn't. We'd have never reached this point without your help.~|~translationMissing
It wouldn't have been possible without you or Martin either. Have you two spoken yet?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm going to need a lot to drink before I'm ready for that conversation.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, have you seen our special guest?~|~translationMissing
The scene pans towards the front banquet table.~|~translationMissing
King Kandur Hosidius~|~translationMissing
It's a pleasure to finally welcome you to Great Kourend, Queen Zyanyi. You are very welcome here.~|~translationMissing
Queen Zyanyi Arkan~|~translationMissing
The pleasure is all mine. From today, the sun will shine on our two kingdoms once more. The mistakes of the past are now behind us.~|~translationMissing
Who is she?~|~translationMissing
Zyanyi Arkan, the Sun Queen. She's the ruler of Varlamore, the kingdom in the south. This is her first visit to Kourend.~|~translationMissing
First visit?~|~translationMissing
Indeed. The King personally invited her. He's keen to put an end to the animosity between the two kingdoms. Rumor has it she feels the same way.~|~translationMissing
Who are the knights with her?~|~translationMissing
Her royal guard, the Kualti.~|~translationMissing
They look fancy.~|~translationMissing
They do. If the stories are true, they're the best fighters in Varlamore.~|~translationMissing
Not jealous are you?~|~translationMissing
Not of that armour, that's for sure. It looks very uncomfortable.~|~translationMissing
Queen Zyanyi Arkan and her Kualti begin to leave.~|~translationMissing
Ah, looks like they're done. You should go and see the King. He was pretty keen to speak to you.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll see you later.~|~translationMissing
The player approaches King Kandur Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, Your Majesty. Congratulations on your coronation.~|~translationMissing
Thank you my friend. Of course, none of this would have been possible without you. Let it be known that you will always be a friend of this kingdom.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, I'm very honoured.~|~translationMissing
As am I. In fact, I think this calls for a toast.~|~translationMissing
Gather around honoured guests! It's time for me to bore you all with a speech!~|~translationMissing
The guests approach King Kandur Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
Friends, thank you all for joining me on this special day. This is the beginning of a new chapter for Kourend, and I could not be more grateful to have you all here to celebrate with me.~|~translationMissing
Still, let us not forget the hard road that led us here, nor those who were brave enough to walk along it.~|~translationMissing
Martin Holt, Lydia Fullore, [player name]. Without you, we would all still be living in ignorance. You opened our eyes to the truth, and ensured a strong future for Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Now, let us all raise our glasses to these three. We are forever in their debt.~|~translationMissing
The scene fades to black, and transitions to one with King Kandur Hosidius and the player alone behind Kourend's throne.~|~translationMissing
Ah, there you are.~|~translationMissing
You wanted to speak to me?~|~translationMissing
I did. Sorry to take you away from the festivities. With everyone else celebrating, I thought it would be a good chance to talk in private. Don't worry. It won't take long.~|~translationMissing
It's not a problem. What did you want to discuss?~|~translationMissing
The councillors are behind bars and Kourend has a new ruler. On the surface, all is well again. Of course, that's not quite the case in reality.~|~translationMissing
You mean Xamphur?~|~translationMissing
Yes. The Council did not act alone. In fact, they weren't even the true orchestrators in this. We need to find and deal with the real foe before it's too late.~|~translationMissing
I'd be happy to help in any way I can. Xamphur and I have unfinished business.~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you'd say that. This is a serious threat we're facing, and I need people I can trust.~|~translationMissing
So, what do you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
Nothing for now. I just wanted to make sure you were on board. Once we have more information on Xamphur, I will let you know.~|~translationMissing
Now, we should head back downstairs before we are missed.~|~translationMissing
A knife is launched at the king's back.~|~translationMissing
Is everything alright, Your Majesty?~|~translationMissing
I... I can't...~|~translationMissing
The king falls, and an assassin is revealed to the player.~|~translationMissing
Kandur Hosidius. You have been marked for death.~|~translationMissing
The assassin teleports away, and the cutscene ends.~|~translationMissing
Hey Lydia. How are you doing?~|~translationMissing
It's been a rough few days since the coronation, as you can probably imagine. One moment we were crowning a new king, that next we were burying him. I'm doing okay, though. Work is a good distraction.~|~translationMissing
And how's that going?~|~translationMissing
Well Artur Hosidius is now the King of Great Kourend. I'm sorry you couldn't be there for the ceremony. After what happened, they felt something small would be best.~|~translationMissing
That's fine. I think one coronation was enough for me. Any word on the killer?~|~translationMissing
There's no shortage of potential suspects, but nothing solid. We've had the murder weapon sent over to Lovakengj to be examined. They have a theory, but want to do more work before they confirm it.~|~translationMissing
Well let me know once they have something. I want to find whoever did this.~|~translationMissing
We will.~|~translationMissing
Anything else I can do in the meantime?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so. Lord Arceuus is trying to find out more about Xamphur, but he doesn't have anything yet. For now, all we can do is wait.~|~translationMissing
And on that note, I wanted to give you a little something to thank you for all that you've done. Not just for Kourend, but for me as well.~|~translationMissing
This is a bad situation we're in, but without you things would be a whole lot worse. Lord Arceuus also sent something over for you. He said you'd know what to do with it.~|~translationMissing
Now, I'll let you get going. Thanks again, for everything.~|~translationMissing
Congratulations! Quest complete!~|~translationMissing

Don't worry, you're not the first to sneak in. The guards here turn a blind eye to that sort of thing. Outsiders generally perform better in the Theatre, so make for more interesting entertainment.~|~translationMissing
Even the outsiders don't survive though. No one does. You however, might just have what it takes.~|~translationMissing
Where are you going with this?~|~translationMissing
You're strong enough to survive the Theatre, but you need a reason to try. I have a little proposition for you.~|~translationMissing
Go on...~|~translationMissing
The Theatre is owned by Lady Verzik Vitur, a vampyre noble. I represent a party that has certain... interests in Verzik.~|~translationMissing
Enter the Theatre and beat the challenges within. Doing so would be quite the embarrassment for Verzik, something that my associates would very much appreciate.~|~translationMissing
So you just need me to embarrass her? Doesn't sound too bad.~|~translationMissing
Be aware, this will be no easy challenge. I doubt you'll succeed alone. However, the guards will let you enter in a group of up to five. I suggest you take advantage of this.~|~translationMissing
You can use the notice board to find suitable allies with whom to enter the Theatre.~|~translationMissing
Have you any advice to help me?~|~translationMissing
Actually, I do. Verzik's magic prevents most forms of teleportation. However, there is a special crystal with the power to overcome this restriction.~|~translationMissing
I have... acquired some shards of the crystal. Do not ask me how. If you take one into the Theatre, you can use it to teleport to safety in an emergency.~|~translationMissing
I can sell you some of these shards if you wish.~|~translationMissing
Go and buy teleport crystals.~|~translationMissing
(Shop interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Enter the Theatre without any teleport crystals.~|~translationMissing
Very well, I'll do my best.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. Return to me if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Any luck in the Theatre?~|~translationMissing
I've managed to defeat Verzik!~|~translationMissing
Really?~|~translationMissing
Yes! After beating all of her challenges, she chose to face me herself. I couldn't fully defeat her though. She just transformed into a bat and flew away.~|~translationMissing
Very impressive. I had a feeling you would have what it takes.~|~translationMissing
Verzik will be back soon enough. Death will not come easy for her. However, you have still been of great use to my associates.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of your associates, what's all this really about?~|~translationMissing
Well you don't really expect me to believe you're just here to embarrass Verzik do you? What's really going on?~|~translationMissing
My associates prefer to keep their intentions to themselves. However, if you were to assist us with another matter, I might be able to share more.~|~translationMissing
Start the quest A Night at the Theatre?~|~translationMissing
Your suspicions are correct. My role here is not to embarrass Verzik Vitur. Instead, my associates have a long history with Verzik, and have sent me here to keep an eye on her.~|~translationMissing
So you're spying on her? Then why are you asking people to go and 'embarrass' her?~|~translationMissing
Research.~|~translationMissing
Research?~|~translationMissing
Yes. As you're aware, of all those that go into the Theatre, the vast majority never come out. That said, some have managed to succeed, yourself included.~|~translationMissing
Of course, the vampyres would never let the citizens know this.~|~translationMissing
Thanks to these successes, I've been able to gather information on Verzik and her abilities.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so we're the ones that have been doing the spying. Still, that doesn't explain what this is all for.~|~translationMissing
Verzik has abilities unlike any other vampyre. However, she did not always possess these abilities. My associates are keen to discover how she obtained them.~|~translationMissing
You mean that thing she does where she turns into a spider?~|~translationMissing
Right, I think I understand now. So where do I come in?~|~translationMissing
These were recently recovered from within the Theatre. Take a look at them.~|~translationMissing
The Mysterious Stranger shows you some eggs.~|~translationMissing
Eggs?~|~translationMissing
Not just any eggs. These are the eggs of a nylocas, one of Verzik's arachnid pets.~|~translationMissing
Normally this wouldn't be anything special. After all, Verzik has hundreds of nylocas. However, these eggs are from a variant we've never encountered before.~|~translationMissing
What's more interesting than that though is how they were obtained. For lack of a better description, the mercenary who recovered them claimed they 'fell out' of Verzik herself.~|~translationMissing
Verzik laid some eggs?~|~translationMissing
Apparently so.~|~translationMissing
How lovely. I think you've safely put me off my food for the rest of today. So you think these eggs are somehow connected to her unique abilities?~|~translationMissing
It would line up with some suspicions my associates have had for a while.~|~translationMissing
Not to mention the whole turning into a spider thing I guess. I suppose you want me to look into this?~|~translationMissing
That is correct. I also believe you have a friend who can help.~|~translationMissing
I have a friend?~|~translationMissing
A dead one.~|~translationMissing
Ah, that sounds about right. Which dead friend are we talking about here?~|~translationMissing
Ranis Drakan.~|~translationMissing
Right... And how's a dead vampyre going to help us exactly?~|~translationMissing
My kind have the ability to relive our memories as if they are happening again. We can also relive the memories of others if we are able to make physical contact with them. I could show you if you want?~|~translationMissing
Please don't go poking through my memories. Also, what do you mean by 'your kind'?~|~translationMissing
I am not at liberty to say.~|~translationMissing
Of course. How silly of me. And you want to relive Ranis' memories I'm guessing? Will that even work now that he's dead?~|~translationMissing
We are lucky that vampyre corpses deteriorate slower than many other species. Enough of his brain should still be intact for me to work with.~|~translationMissing
Err... Nice. What's he got to do with these eggs though?~|~translationMissing
Ranis and Verzik were close friends. He interacted with her more than anyone else did. Getting close enough to Verzik to observe her own memories will be... problematic. He is the next best option.~|~translationMissing
Within his memories we can hopefully learn more about Verzik and her abilities. As for the eggs, they are our catalyst.~|~translationMissing
It would take years to search through all of Ranis' mind, but I can use these eggs to help us find relevant memories much faster.~|~translationMissing
Now, I must remain here. That means you will need to recover Ranis for us.~|~translationMissing
And where can I find him?~|~translationMissing
Luckily for us, Ranis always loved the Theatre. As such, he is actually buried deep below it. You can use the staircase to the north east to access his crypt.~|~translationMissing
Be careful, it's well guarded. Even other vampyres are not allowed in. I suggest you take that flail of yours.~|~translationMissing
Also, you don't need to bring his whole body back of course. That wouldn't be very subtle. We only need his brain.~|~translationMissing
Brains are generally attached to the body you know.~|~translationMissing
I know. That's why I'd recommend you take a saw.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Oh god.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm not that interested.~|~translationMissing
Happy to help... I guess.~|~translationMissing
Select an Option~|~translationMissing
Enter the Theatre and beat the challenges within. Doing so would cause great embarrasment to Verzik, and my associates would very much appreciate it.~|~translationMissing
What's all this really about?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I get those teleport crystals you mentioned?~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Return to me when that changes.~|~translationMissing
You again. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
What's this thing you need from me?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Nothing, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Ranis?~|~translationMissing
You can use the staircase to the north east to access his crypt. Remember, you don't need to bring his whole body back. We only need his brain. I'd recommend you take a saw.~|~translationMissing
I think I want to be sick.~|~translationMissing
The gate is locked.~|~translationMissing
Well this is probably one of the more disgusting things I've ever done. Here goes nothing...~|~translationMissing
You get to work on removing Ranis' head.~|~translationMissing
You successfully remove the head of Ranis Drakan.~|~translationMissing
Hey there Ranis. Didn't expect to see you again. How are you doing?~|~translationMissing
Ranis doesn't reply.~|~translationMissing
Well I think I might be at my lowest point in life right now. I really need to find a hobby or something.~|~translationMissing
You search the coffin and find the head of Ranis Drakan, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You search the coffin and find the headless body of Ranis Drakan. Lovely.~|~translationMissing
You search the coffin and find the head of Ranis Drakan.~|~translationMissing
I managed to recover Ranis' head.~|~translationMissing
Good work. Hand it over.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the head~|~translationMissing
Well... I seem to have lost it.~|~translationMissing
You should probably go and find it again then.~|~translationMissing
You give Ranis' head to the Mysterious Stranger.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Yes, I think this will work.~|~translationMissing
It seems that Ranis has many memories of these eggs, or at least of something very similar. Thanks to my abilities, we can view these memories. Hopefully they will reveal the truth about Verzik.~|~translationMissing
Now, I suggest we start at the beginning. Take my hand.~|~translationMissing
Why are you making this weird?~|~translationMissing
I require physical contact to share the memory with you.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Fair enough.~|~translationMissing
Prepare yourself!~|~translationMissing
The first of Ranis' memories are displayed in the player's mind. Ranis Drakan, at The Maiden of Sugadinti's chamber, is seen with a vyrewatch.~|~translationMissing
Ranis Drakan~|~translationMissing
Do you have them?~|~translationMissing
Vyrewatch~|~translationMissing
Right here, my lord.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. I will take them from here.~|~translationMissing
Of course.~|~translationMissing
Ranis Drakan walks towards Verzik Vitur.~|~translationMissing
Verzik Vitur~|~translationMissing
Ranis my dear, how wonderful to see you.~|~translationMissing
And you Verzik.~|~translationMissing
I see you've wasted no time in introducing our new guest to the Theatre.~|~translationMissing
I must say, I find the name you've given her to be quite interesting. Not the kind of thing I'd have expected from you.~|~translationMissing
Well I thought it would be quite humorous.~|~translationMissing
I see. So you intend to use her as a new challenge?~|~translationMissing
It seemed an ironically fitting role for her, given that fun little narrative you came up with. Besides, with all the work you put in, it would have felt wrong to just abandon her.~|~translationMissing
You should not have worried about that. The things we learnt from her down in the labs more than made up for the effort.~|~translationMissing
Well either way, I'm glad she's here. I've found her to be quite the inspiration. Thanks to her, I've decided to give the whole place a bit of a sprucing up.~|~translationMissing
You're replacing all the challenges?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! Those old ones were getting dull. It's time for some fresh excitement in this place.~|~translationMissing
Well perhaps I have something that can help with that. I have a gift for you.~|~translationMissing
A gift? Oh Ranis you do spoil me!~|~translationMissing
You can thank Lowerniel for this one. He found these eggs in an arachnid nest north of Darkmeyer. He thought you might be able to use them in your nylocas breeding program.~|~translationMissing
How exciting! Do pass on my thanks. He is always welcome to come and pay me a visit himself, of course.~|~translationMissing
The Theatre has never really been his thing.~|~translationMissing
Oh Ranis, I do love your brother, but he is such a bore! He needs to learn to live a little!~|~translationMissing
Anyway, tell me more about this nest.~|~translationMissing
The arachnids there are highly unique. Lowerniel thinks their queen might be of a higher power.~|~translationMissing
A higher power? He doesn't think that silly stone he used to have is involved, does he?~|~translationMissing
No, he suspects something more natural.~|~translationMissing
Really? Well either way, if he's right, these eggs could be key to some very exciting new nylocas.~|~translationMissing
I look forward to seeing the results.~|~translationMissing
As do I...~|~translationMissing
Interesting... Very interesting...~|~translationMissing
That was Verzik?~|~translationMissing
It was. However, the memory was from many years ago, before she gained her unique abilities.~|~translationMissing
I see. So what's our next step?~|~translationMissing
The eggs in that memory were very similar to the ones in my possession, but they were not identical. It sounded like Verzik intended to use them to breed new nylocas.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps that breeding is what led to the eggs you have.~|~translationMissing
And perhaps it was also the starting point for Verzik's abilities.~|~translationMissing
How can we be sure?~|~translationMissing
We will need to recover some of those eggs for ourselves. With them, we may be able to find further relevant memories.~|~translationMissing
Ranis said they came from a nest north of Darkmeyer. I'll see if I can find it.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. I will remain here.~|~translationMissing
Any reason why you're not able to join me?~|~translationMissing
Actually, let me guess. Your associates...~|~translationMissing
My associates would prefer I remain here.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure why I asked. I'll be back once I've explored this nest.~|~translationMissing
So what are we doing with Ranis' head?~|~translationMissing
So about that memory...~|~translationMissing
What about it?~|~translationMissing
Where can I find that nest?~|~translationMissing
It's supposedly just north of Darkmeyer. Go there and see if you can find any eggs matching the ones Ranis gave to Verzik.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll be back once I've explored this nest.~|~translationMissing
You try to rip open to egg sac, but it's too strong.~|~translationMissing
If the player has inventory space~|~translationMissing
You search the skeleton and find a sticky note.~|~translationMissing
If the player has no inventory space~|~translationMissing
You search the skeleton and find a sticky note, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Daer Krand~|~translationMissing
Well met!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Why are you here?~|~translationMissing
Got any sulphuric acid?~|~translationMissing
What? What for?~|~translationMissing
Well I was exploring a cave west of here and I think I found your assistant.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering where she got to. Where is she now?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes... About that...~|~translationMissing
Well... she's dead I'm afraid. Looks like the spiders in the cave killed her. Ate most of her as well...~|~translationMissing
What a disaster! It's going to take forever to find a new willing assistant who's competent as well.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... Oddly enough I can't imagine many people will be queueing up to go get themselves eaten by spiders for you.~|~translationMissing
Still, if it helps, it looks like she did find what she was after. There's an egg sac near where I found her. If I had some sulphuric acid, I could melt through it.~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose I can give you some. Consider it a thank you for bringing me the news about my assistant.~|~translationMissing
Daer Krand tries to give you some sulphuric acid, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Come back when you have some room for it.~|~translationMissing
Daer Krand gives you some sulphuric acid.~|~translationMissing
Thanks! Want me to bring you some of those eggs?~|~translationMissing
No, it's fine. I'll send my new assistant to get me some... Once I find a new assistant anyway.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) See you later.~|~translationMissing
Yes, here you go.~|~translationMissing
Thanks!~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the acid~|~translationMissing
Looks like you already have some.~|~translationMissing
Oh... So I do. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
Did I not already give you some?~|~translationMissing
Oh... Well I suppose I can spare some.~|~translationMissing
You use the acid to melt through the egg sac.~|~translationMissing
You take some strange spider eggs from within the egg sac.~|~translationMissing
You search the egg sac and find some strange spider eggs, but you don't have enough room to take them.~|~translationMissing
You search the egg sac and find some strange spider eggs.~|~translationMissing
I found some of those eggs.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Let's have a look at them.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the eggs~|~translationMissing
I don't actually have them with me.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll need you to bring them here. They could be key to understanding Verzik's abilities.~|~translationMissing
You give the strange spider eggs to the Mysterious Stranger.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... How curious...~|~translationMissing
I believe I can use these new eggs to help us find more memories of note. Hopefully they will start to present a clearer picture for us.~|~translationMissing
Well that would be nice. I'm still a bit lost to be honest... Then again, I guess that's just the norm for me.~|~translationMissing
Once we're done, I'll also have the eggs sent to my associates. Assuming they do have a connection to Verzik's abilities, they will come in very useful.~|~translationMissing
Your associates aren't trying to replicate her powers are they?~|~translationMissing
Oh quite the opposite. Their hope is to find a way to counteract them.~|~translationMissing
Interesting...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I think I have found a new memory for us.~|~translationMissing
Let's take a look.~|~translationMissing
Ranis' second memory is viewed. Ranis, alongside Verzik, meet in the Pestilent Bloat's chamber.~|~translationMissing
Bloat? Not the most elaborate of names, is it?~|~translationMissing
A crude name for a crude creation.~|~translationMissing
Well it's most definitely crude... Quite disgusting as well.~|~translationMissing
Turns your stomach, does it Ranis? I'm surprised you'd find anything disgusting after what you did to that girl.~|~translationMissing
I just think it's important to take a bit of pride in your work. This is a Theatre, Verzik. We should be producing art!~|~translationMissing
Ranis darling, I couldn't agree more. Come have a look at this.~|~translationMissing
Ranis and Verzik walk towards a Nylocas Athanatos.~|~translationMissing
A new nylocas?~|~translationMissing
The athanatos! Isn't it magnificent!~|~translationMissing
It's quite a sight to behold.~|~translationMissing
I have you and Lowerniel to thank for this one. This is the result of those eggs you gave me.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you were able to make good use of them.~|~translationMissing
Oh I've been able to work wonders with them, and I'm not done yet. If all goes well, the athanatos will be just the beginning...~|~translationMissing
So Verzik did manage to use those eggs to create new nylocas. However, something is still missing.~|~translationMissing
Is there another memory that could tell us more?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I believe there is. Let us see what it can tell us.~|~translationMissing
Ranis' third memory is viewed. Ranis, alongside Verzik, meet in the nylocas chamber.~|~translationMissing
My my... You've really outdone yourself this time.~|~translationMissing
Ranis you flatterer!~|~translationMissing
So was this one also the result of those eggs?~|~translationMissing
Much more boring I'm afraid. I still have plans for those eggs, but I'm missing a key aspect right now. Don't worry, I'm sure I'll get it worked out.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I can help. What are you missing?~|~translationMissing
Oh Ranis, you're not trying to steal my thunder are you?~|~translationMissing
Verzik, you know I wouldn't...~|~translationMissing
Just joking Ranis! I know you're far too noble for that.~|~translationMissing
The thing I need is something with the ability to regenerate. Nylocas are strong in numbers, but far too weak on their own.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I think I know just the thing. When we created the Maiden, we experimented heavily in that area.~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course. You and your haemalchemy.~|~translationMissing
Well in the end it wasn't actually haemalchemy that gave us the answer. It came in the form of a gift from the old queen.~|~translationMissing
Not another of her plants was it?~|~translationMissing
Precisely that! Specifically the hespori. Their bark has wonderful regenerative abilities.~|~translationMissing
I see... Yes, I think that might just work. Thank you, Ranis.~|~translationMissing
Hespori... Of course.~|~translationMissing
If the player has grown a hespori before~|~translationMissing
I've grown a hespori before!~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't grown a hespori before~|~translationMissing
What's a hespori?~|~translationMissing
They are remarkable plants with a will of their own. Not to mention their many unique properties...~|~translationMissing
They were grown here back when this place was still known as Hallowvale. The Saradominist Queen of the region used them as weapons against the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
You know your history.~|~translationMissing
More than most.~|~translationMissing
It sounds like the vampyres found multiple uses for the hespori. Not only did they play a part in the creation of the Maiden of Sugadinti, but they were also potentially used to make a new nylocas.~|~translationMissing
I'm guessing this is the bit where I retrieve some hespori bark for us.~|~translationMissing
You are correct. However, I'd suggest you collect some from a naturally occuring hespori rather than one you've grown yourself.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where I can find one?~|~translationMissing
They are native to Morytania, but they are quite rare. I'm afraid I'm not an expert on nature.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I know of a nature spirit who lives in the swamp. He can probably help.~|~translationMissing
Perfect. I will await your return.~|~translationMissing
So we have the eggs. Now what?~|~translationMissing
That memory didn't tell us too much.~|~translationMissing
It seems Verzik did manage to use those eggs to create new nylocas. However, something is still missing.~|~translationMissing
That memory seemed more useful.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. It seems a hespori is key to our next steps.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find a hespori?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. They are native to Morytania, but they are quite rare. You mentioned a nature spirit who could help.~|~translationMissing
That's right! He lives in the swamp.~|~translationMissing
Then you should go and speak to him. I will await your return.~|~translationMissing
Nature Spirit~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, my friend. I sense that you need my help with something.~|~translationMissing
That's right! I'm looking for a hespori. I was hoping you might know where one is.~|~translationMissing
Ah, a hespori. They're wonderful plants. Why are you looking for one?~|~translationMissing
Err... Just some research...~|~translationMissing
Research? What are you researching?~|~translationMissing
Just... plants... and stuff...~|~translationMissing
I see... Well do be very careful. Hespori are rare enough as it is without people damaging them.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... I'm definitely not going to damage it in any way.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Now, let me see...~|~translationMissing
Yes! I can sense the presence of a hespori near here. It's to the north east, on a small island in the swamp.~|~translationMissing
Great! Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
For you my friend, it is no problem at all.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, my friend. Did you find that hespori?~|~translationMissing
Can you remind me where it is?~|~translationMissing
I can sense it to the north east, on a small island in the swamp.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a proper axe~|~translationMissing
To chop the hespori, you'll need an axe that you have the Woodcutting level to use.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not previously killed the Hespori~|~translationMissing
(The Hespori attacks.)~|~translationMissing
Your inventory is too full to do that.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not already have bark~|~translationMissing
You chop some bark from the hespori.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has bark~|~translationMissing
You already have some hespori bark.~|~translationMissing
I found a hespori.~|~translationMissing
Perfect. Do you have some bark from it?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the bark~|~translationMissing
Then you should go and recover some. Be careful, for it will likely fight back. I will await your return.~|~translationMissing
You give the hespori bark to the Mysterious Stranger.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. This is just what we needed.~|~translationMissing
Can it help us find more memories?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think so. Let me see what I can find...~|~translationMissing
Ah, here we go. I believe we're getting close now.~|~translationMissing
Ranis' fourth memory is viewed. Ranis, alongside Verzik, meet in Sotetseg's chamber.~|~translationMissing
Power over the Shadow Realm you say? That takes me back to the old empire.~|~translationMissing
That was the inspiration. Alas, the experiments didn't really go anywhere in the end.~|~translationMissing
Such a pity. Still, he will make for a fine new challenge here. As always Ranis, you are far too generous.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of experiments, did you think any more on my hespori suggestion for that new nylocas?~|~translationMissing
That I did. It's going very well so far. Still too early to be sure, but I think this could be the one.~|~translationMissing
The one?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! The nylocas to end all nylocas.~|~translationMissing
That's quite the ambition. So when do we get to see the results?~|~translationMissing
Patience now Ranis. You can't rush perfection. It won't be long now, I'm sure of it...~|~translationMissing
Interesting, but not overly illuminating. Still, we are not far off now.~|~translationMissing
There is one final memory. Let us hope it provides the answers we seek.~|~translationMissing
Alright. Let's take a look.~|~translationMissing
Ranis' fifth and final memory is viewed. Ranis, alongside Verzik, meet in Xarpus' chamber.~|~translationMissing
The last King of the yarasa... I never thought I'd see one of their kind again.~|~translationMissing
Does this mean Lowerniel finally found a way home?~|~translationMissing
It would seem so, but he did not enlighten me on how he did it.~|~translationMissing
Fascinating...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I have something you simply have to see. Come take a look.~|~translationMissing
Is this...?~|~translationMissing
This is the one Ranis. This is my new Queen Nylocas. All that work has finally paid off.~|~translationMissing
It's very small.~|~translationMissing
Oh don't worry darling, it will grow. I'll have to come up with a fancy name as well.~|~translationMissing
The spider bites Verzik, and dies.~|~translationMissing
Ouch! You little...~|~translationMissing
Not what you were expecting?~|~translationMissing
I really thought this was the one...~|~translationMissing
Back to square one I guess. What a waste.~|~translationMissing
That was it? She made a new nylocas, it bit her and it just died?~|~translationMissing
We have still gained a lot here. That bite almost certainly led to her abilities, and we know how the nylocas variant responsible was created.~|~translationMissing
We even have the relevant materials as well. Between them and the knowledge we now have, my associates should be able to begin work on new weapons and techniques to use against Verzik.~|~translationMissing
But who knows what may have happened after that bite... What if we're missing some key information?~|~translationMissing
I admit, while hopefully not essential, clarity on what happened next would be very useful. However, Ranis has no further memories of use to us. There's likely to only be one place to find the truth now.~|~translationMissing
You mean Verzik herself?~|~translationMissing
Correct. But for me to gain access to Verzik's memories, I'd need to make physical contact with her. That would require us to enter the Theatre, something I was quite keen to avoid.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed a Theatre of Blood raid previously~|~translationMissing
I've made it through the Theatre before. I could do it again.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed a Theatre of Blood raid previously~|~translationMissing
I've never made it through the Theatre before, but I'm sure I can manage it.~|~translationMissing
True, but I am no fighter. However...~|~translationMissing
I know that there have been times when groups have entered the Theatre and had members not actually participate in the challenges.~|~translationMissing
Provided the more able members of the group succeed, these individuals are still considered to have beaten the challenge.~|~translationMissing
So you want me to 'carry' you through the Theatre?~|~translationMissing
That is an apt way of putting it. If you can get me to Verzik, I should hopefully be able to extract the memories we need. The moment of defeat will be my best opportunity, when she is weakest.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I think we can make this work.~|~translationMissing
As you've completed the Theatre of Blood before, you can choose to skip this section if you wish.~|~translationMissing
You can still take other people in as well of course. Just use the notice board to set up a party and find suitable allies. Once you're ready, I will join you in the Theatre.~|~translationMissing
In that case, I'll see you in there.~|~translationMissing
Can we use this bark to find more memories?~|~translationMissing
Do you have any more memories for us to look at?~|~translationMissing
This Verzik business kind of feels like it's been a waste of time.~|~translationMissing
Verzik made a new nylocas, it bit her and it just died. That was it.~|~translationMissing
Ready to enter the Theatre?~|~translationMissing
I am. Remember, you need to get me all the way to Verzik herself and then defeat her. When she is at her weakest, I should be able able to extract the memories we need.~|~translationMissing
Don't forget you can use the notice board to find suitable allies to join us if you don't feel comfortable doing this alone. I will join you inside once you are ready.~|~translationMissing
You fought well. Now, let us move on. We have to reach Verzik so that I can extract her memories.~|~translationMissing
The Maiden of Sugadinti. Such an ironic name.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about her?~|~translationMissing
Not much more than you probably know yourself. Hers is a tragic tale of misguided hope.~|~translationMissing
You might find it useful to know that she's a powerful user of magic. Unsurprisingly, blood magic is her specialism. I hear she also has a habit of using nylocas to further increase her power.~|~translationMissing
Good to know. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
The Pestilent Bloat. What a disgusting monstrosity.~|~translationMissing
What even is it?~|~translationMissing
Nothing fancier than some crude necromancy. Still, that doesn't mean it's not dangerous. Don't even try to take it head on. Wait for the perfect moment and attack while it is weak.~|~translationMissing
Will do.~|~translationMissing
Nylocas... I've always hated nylocas.~|~translationMissing
You've encountered nylocas before?~|~translationMissing
Some types. Alone they're not overly dangerous, but you'll never encounter them alone. Their power is in numbers.~|~translationMissing
So how do I overcome that?~|~translationMissing
Different variants have different weaknesses. Prioritise your targets, and ensure you use the right weaponry against them.~|~translationMissing
Sotetseg. One of the greater mysteries of this Theatre.~|~translationMissing
He's some sort of modified dark beast. No dark beasts have ever been encountered in Morytania, so who knows how the vampyres got him here. Perhaps he is not of this world at all...~|~translationMissing
Be careful, for he has a strong affinity with the shadow realm. He will almost certainly use it against you. Expect the unexpected.~|~translationMissing
Unexpected?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Survivors of the Theatre have spoken of some sort of strange shadowy maze.~|~translationMissing
I see...~|~translationMissing
The once great King of the yarasa. This prison is such a sad end for Xarpus.~|~translationMissing
You feel sorry for him?~|~translationMissing
Death would be preferable to a life of imprisonment. The Theatre is a testament to that.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, we are close now. Defeat Xarpus, and the path to Verzik is clear.~|~translationMissing
Any advice?~|~translationMissing
He will attempt to power himself up before he fights. Try and stop that where you can. Once the fight begins, be careful of his highly poisonous attacks.~|~translationMissing
Okay thanks.~|~translationMissing
You fought well. Now, only Verzik awaits. Remember, you must fully defeat her for me to have a chance to extract her memories. Let us proceed once you are ready.~|~translationMissing
Did you manage to get any useful memories from Verzik?~|~translationMissing
Yes and no. I have a memory that I belive has answers for us. However, it is not Verzik's memory.~|~translationMissing
I think it's best if I just show you.~|~translationMissing
The memory plays. Verzik, flying from the ceiling, appears.~|~translationMissing
Doctor... are you still there?~|~translationMissing
Vulcan Orvoros~|~translationMissing
I'm right here, my lady. I was just finishing my notes.~|~translationMissing
I feel... I feel... wrong.~|~translationMissing
My lady, as I've already said, we really should take you to my surgery in Darkmeyer. Whatever that nylocas did, it was no normal bite.~|~translationMissing
No! This is my home! You will not take me!~|~translationMissing
I understand. My notes are finished now. I will leave you in peace.~|~translationMissing
Peace? Yes...~|~translationMissing
The doctor leaves.~|~translationMissing
Doctor... It's... inside me!~|~translationMissing
My lady?~|~translationMissing
I can feel it! Help me!~|~translationMissing
Verzik explodes and blood splatters about. In her place, the Nylocas Queen and many nylocas appear.~|~translationMissing
What...~|~translationMissing
Nylocas Queen~|~translationMissing
Come... Come my pretties...~|~translationMissing
Destroy the witness... Let us dine on his corpse!~|~translationMissing
The rule of the vampyres is over... The rule of the nylocas has begun...~|~translationMissing
As the cutscene fades to black, spiders can be heard attacking the doctor, killing him. The memory ends here.~|~translationMissing
Verzik... She died!~|~translationMissing
We feared the worst, but we never anticipated something like this.~|~translationMissing
But does this mean... the Verzik in the Theatre...~|~translationMissing
...is really just that nylocas in disguise. We must inform my master at once.~|~translationMissing
Your master? So these associates you've been going on about... they don't actually exist do they?~|~translationMissing
They do not. My master preferred that I keep his involvement a secret, but I feel you are now trusted enough to meet him.~|~translationMissing
Meet him? Where?~|~translationMissing
In a similar way to how my kind can relive our memories, we can also communicate across great distances.~|~translationMissing
Another of my kind is with my master. Through the two of us, you will be able to speak with him.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I think I understand.~|~translationMissing
The player and the stranger enter their mind threshold.~|~translationMissing
Well this is weird.~|~translationMissing
It can take some getting used to. Now, I will contact my master and inform him of what we have discovered. Once I am done, I expect he will want to speak with you.~|~translationMissing
There. Now, when I next speak, it will be my voice you hear. However, the words are from my master.~|~translationMissing
Mysterious Master~|~translationMissing
Greetings my child. It is good that we are finally able to speak, for you have done a great service to me and my disciples.~|~translationMissing
It would be nicer if we could speak in person.~|~translationMissing
If that were possible, we would make it so. There are many constraints upon us. Still, these constraints are often to our benefit.~|~translationMissing
We share many common enemies, you and I. Enemies that infest Hallowvale like a disease.~|~translationMissing
By remaining far away from this disease, I keep us all safer. Instead, my disciples act as my eyes, ears, and hands upon Gielinor. They are the harbingers of my will.~|~translationMissing
So where are you then?~|~translationMissing
Home.~|~translationMissing
Right... And what's your connection to Verzik?~|~translationMissing
She was an old foe. We will not weep for her demise.~|~translationMissing
What about this nylocas that's replaced her?~|~translationMissing
A concerning development. However, you have gathered all that we need to overcome it when the time is right.~|~translationMissing
When the time is right?~|~translationMissing
When the time is right.~|~translationMissing
So there's nothing further for us to do now?~|~translationMissing
No. For now, we must wait. But once again, you have my thanks. My disciple will ensure you are suitably rewarded. Know that you are now a friend of Sugadinti.~|~translationMissing
The player returns to Ver Sinhaza.~|~translationMissing
You again. My master is very impressed with your work. On his behalf, allow me to reward you.~|~translationMissing

6.2 Talking to Spria~|~translationMissing
You search through the notice board...~|~translationMissing
'Damaged roof tiles for sale'... 'Come on down to Bob's Axes'... 'Contributions welcomed to Ned's New-Window Fund'...~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute, what's this?~|~translationMissing
'Keen fighter sought to deal with troublesome monster. Reward offered. Speak to Sarah at the South Falador Farm for details.'~|~translationMissing
This could be worth looking into.~|~translationMissing
Start the A Porcine of Interest quest?~|~translationMissing
Right, let's go and see what Sarah has in mind.~|~translationMissing
You search through the notice board but find nothing more of interest.~|~translationMissing
Sarah~|~translationMissing
Hello. How can I help you?~|~translationMissing
Talk about the bounty.~|~translationMissing
I've come about the bounty.~|~translationMissing
Oh thank Saradomin! It's about time someone responded, something needs to be done!~|~translationMissing
Can you explain what happened?~|~translationMissing
Of course. I was making my monthly delivery to The Sheared Ram in Lumbridge, heading east near the Draynor Village crossroads.~|~translationMissing
Suddenly, out of the trees came a hulking monster! It chased me for a short distance, but luckily Rosie managed to spook it enough to give me a headstart.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like it must have given you quite the scare!~|~translationMissing
It certainly did. I even lost my cart full of farm produce!~|~translationMissing
What did the monster look like?~|~translationMissing
What did this monster look like?~|~translationMissing
I didn't get a very good look at it I'm afraid. It was getting dark and as soon as I saw it charging at me, I ran.~|~translationMissing
I can still hear the sound, though. A horrible grunting... squealing...~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else you wanted?~|~translationMissing
Any tips on finding this thing?~|~translationMissing
Tips...? You're supposed to be the professional monster slayer!~|~translationMissing
Although, I suppose a good place to start would be checking the area I was attacked. See if you can find the remains of my cart.~|~translationMissing
Ok, yes that could work.~|~translationMissing
Whereabouts were you attacked again?~|~translationMissing
I remember being somewhere near the crossroads, north of Draynor Village.~|~translationMissing
Sorry that I'm not much help. It happened so fast, the whole thing is a bit of a blur.~|~translationMissing
That's okay. Crossroads north of Draynor... At least I have somewhere to start.~|~translationMissing
You mentioned Rosie. Who's that?~|~translationMissing
You mentioned that Rosie spooked the monster. Who's that?~|~translationMissing
Oh, that'll be our lady over there by the fire. She's such a good dog, always accompanies me on deliveries.~|~translationMissing
You can pet her if you like. She's very friendly.~|~translationMissing
I think that'll be all for now.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Best of luck to you, I'll be waiting right here with your reward.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Talk about something else.~|~translationMissing
It seems as though the monster was trying to run off with some of Sarah's produce. From the looks of things, it was heading north-east.~|~translationMissing
The cabbage is damaged and has begun to yellow.~|~translationMissing
The carrot has been slightly gnawed on.~|~translationMissing
Weird... What sort of monster charges at someone and then steals a bunch of carrots?~|~translationMissing
These potatoes seem to have been largely untouched.~|~translationMissing
Would you look at that... Apparently our monster is picky.~|~translationMissing
Something pretty big must have come running through here to knock this over.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a rope in their inventory~|~translationMissing
This looks like the place. It's a long way down, though... I'll need to tie something onto the edge.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a rope in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You tie the rope tightly around a protruding rock.~|~translationMissing
Huh... there's a rope already down here. I hope noone[sic] else has got to this monster first.~|~translationMissing
Oh it's you, my monster slayer! How goes the quest?~|~translationMissing
I'm still working on it... I've managed to find its lair though.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like you're making progress. Take care!~|~translationMissing
The skeleton seems fresh. It looks like the bones have been gnawed clean fairly recently.~|~translationMissing
There's also a scrawled note. It's barely readable...~|~translationMissing
Well, that's not exactly reassuring.~|~translationMissing
A level 37 Pig Thing appears behind the player.~|~translationMissing
Uhh... Nice piggy?~|~translationMissing
The Pig Thing sprays acid at the player.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing Gnome goggles~|~translationMissing
Argh! My eyes!~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing Gnome goggles~|~translationMissing
Argh! My eyes! The goggles do nothing!~|~translationMissing
Some time passes...~|~translationMissing
Pig Thing~|~translationMissing
*Sniff* *Sniff*~|~translationMissing
*Snort*~|~translationMissing
The Pig Thing walks away.~|~translationMissing
...~|~translationMissing
Spria enters the cave.~|~translationMissing
Spria~|~translationMissing
Well then, what do we have here?~|~translationMissing
Spria approaches the player's unconscious body.~|~translationMissing
Still breathing, eh...?~|~translationMissing
Seems I came at just the right time.~|~translationMissing
We'd better get you out of here before that thing returns.~|~translationMissing
The player wakes up in Spria's house in Draynor Village~|~translationMissing
W-what happened? Where am I?~|~translationMissing
I think I find[sic] out more about that monster from Spria in Draynor Village before heading back down there.~|~translationMissing
Oh, you're awake!~|~translationMissing
Who are you? How did I end up here?~|~translationMissing
My name's Spria and I'm a slayer master. You've had a nasty encounter with a Sourhog.~|~translationMissing
A Sourhog? You mean the giant pig monster?~|~translationMissing
Precisely. You're extremely lucky that I found you. Another few hours and you'd have been hog chow.~|~translationMissing
Were you responding to Sarah's bounty too?~|~translationMissing
Yes... It sounded like an easy few coins...~|~translationMissing
I thought as much. I found you on the floor of the cave, you must have been knocked unconscious.~|~translationMissing
That thing caught me completely off-guard. Normally I can handle myself in a fight, but its spitting attack is pretty fearsome!~|~translationMissing
The beast's saliva is extremely acidic and your eyes are most vulnerable. It'll cause terrible injuries and leave you unable to attack or defend yourself very well.~|~translationMissing
So how am I supposed to handle that?~|~translationMissing
Luckily, the Slayer skill provides us with an array of useful equipment and techniques for dealing with... special foes.~|~translationMissing
In the case of our Sourhog, you'll be needing these.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Reinforced goggles.)~|~translationMissing
This eyewear will protect you from the spitting attack, allowing you to fight the monster on equal terms.~|~translationMissing
Most enemies have a weakness, too. The Sourhog's thick hide provides excellent protection against slashing and insulates it from magic damage.~|~translationMissing
You'd be best trying to pierce it with arrows or a stabbing weapon.~|~translationMissing
Go now, the bounty is all yours to claim. I suggest you recoup your strength and head back to fight it using your new goggles.~|~translationMissing
If you make it out alive, collect your bounty and then come see me so that we can speak further.~|~translationMissing
Why are you helping me?~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose I could have left you in there to be eaten...~|~translationMissing
But you know what that'd make me? A monster. And as a slayer master, that's really not a great look.~|~translationMissing
Besides, my father always taught me that knowledge is worth more than gold. I'm happy to sacrifice a few coins in order to pass my experience on to you.~|~translationMissing
Well, I sure am glad you were there to lend a hand. Thank you!~|~translationMissing
Don't mention it. Was there something else?~|~translationMissing
How did I end up back in Draynor Village?~|~translationMissing
I carried you out and dragged you back here to my house to recover, it really wasn't easy. You're welcome to rest here for as long as you need.~|~translationMissing
Was there something else?~|~translationMissing
You said you were a slayer master. What's that?~|~translationMissing
There are many of us. We're experts in the ancient art of monster slaying. People from across Gielinor come to us for tasks and advice.~|~translationMissing
Well... actually, I'm fairly new to this. I've been learning from my father, Turael, for many years. We decided it was finally time for me to continue the family profession.~|~translationMissing
Can I have another pair of Reinforced Goggles?~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pair equipped~|~translationMissing
No, you're still wearing the last pair I gave you!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pair in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You've still got the last one I gave you, it's there in your inventory! Those things aren't cheap, you know.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pair in their bank~|~translationMissing
I know many people all across Gielinor, and my sources tell me you still have the last one in your bank.~|~translationMissing
If a player does not have a pair in their inventory or bank~|~translationMissing
Sure, I have another going spare. Please try to take better care of these.~|~translationMissing
"Spria hands you another pair of Reinforced Goggles."~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about the Sourhog?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm not much of a history buff... But I'll tell you what I know.~|~translationMissing
Many years back, before even I was around, there were two rival family farms not far from where we're standing.~|~translationMissing
Every year the village would hold a 'Finest Swine in Show' prize at the annual faire.~|~translationMissing
The same farmer would win year after year without fail. Driven mad with jealousy, his rival decided to hire a dodgy dark wizard to give him an edge over the competition.~|~translationMissing
The wizard attempted to alter the pig's appearance. I'm sure you can guess how well that went!~|~translationMissing
Long story short, the mutant, what we now know as a Sourhog, went on a brief rampage and escaped.~|~translationMissing
It must have somehow managed to reproduce, because people have reported seeing them in groups.~|~translationMissing
Up until now, so long as they were left alone, they'd keep to themselves. Rumors are, they live in deep underground caverns, scavenging what they can find.~|~translationMissing
But if they're living so close-by and attacking people on roads, then... they must be getting bold and trying to resurface.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has gone through any of the above choices~|~translationMissing
) That'll be all for now.~|~translationMissing
That'll be all for now.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Good luck, slayer.~|~translationMissing
How goes it?~|~translationMissing
I don't want to go back down there without wearing the right equipment!~|~translationMissing
I don't think Spria will be rescuing me this time. If I go in there, I'm fighting this thing to the death!~|~translationMissing
Climb over the blockage?~|~translationMissing
Yes~|~translationMissing
The player climbs over the blockage.~|~translationMissing
No~|~translationMissing
Before I leave, I should go and collect a foot from that dead Sourhog as proof of my kill.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a knife or slash weapon~|~translationMissing
You try to pull a foot off with your bare hands, but to no avail.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I should go and get something sharp.~|~translationMissing
If the player uses something other than a knife or slash weapon~|~translationMissing
I don't think that's sharp enough to cut a foot off...~|~translationMissing
If the player has a knife or slash weapon~|~translationMissing
You slice a foot off and place it inside your backpack.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Sourhog foot in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I've already collected a foot from this thing. I should take it to Sarah.~|~translationMissing
I don't need to go back down there right now. I should take the foot to Sarah and collect my reward.~|~translationMissing
'Ello, and what are you after then?~|~translationMissing
I did it! I killed the Sourhog!~|~translationMissing
Nicely done. Did you collect your reward from Sarah?~|~translationMissing
No, not yet.~|~translationMissing
Go and collect your reward and then come and speak with me.~|~translationMissing
That monster certainly won't be troubling you from now on.~|~translationMissing
Oh that's fantastic news! I'm so relie-~|~translationMissing
Wait, how do I know you're not just saying that to get the bounty?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the sourhog foot~|~translationMissing
I guess I'll go and get you some proof.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the sourhog foot~|~translationMissing
How about this as proof?~|~translationMissing
You pull the foot out of your backpack and show it to Sarah.~|~translationMissing
Eugh! Yes, that certainly looks about right!~|~translationMissing
Indeed, the smell is... something quite special.~|~translationMissing
I'll probably just give it to the dog.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you made it back. Some strange woman in a hood came asking about the job shortly after you left. I didn't really want her back in here.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, thank you so much! Here's your reward.~|~translationMissing
Sarah hands you a heavy pouch of 5,000 coins.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I should speak with Spria and tell her that the monster's been dealt with.~|~translationMissing
Feeling better now that the monster's gone?~|~translationMissing
Very much so! Thanks again. What was it, anyway?~|~translationMissing
It was a Sourhog. A giant bipedal pig creature!~|~translationMissing
Oh crumbs... I think I've heard of those... My grandfather was always rambling on about them.~|~translationMissing
Nevermind... that's all history now. Weren't you heading off to see Spria?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I suppose I should get going.~|~translationMissing
Safe travels!~|~translationMissing
I did it! I killed the Sourhog and collected the bounty from Sarah.~|~translationMissing
Very impressive, slayer. I'm glad that the goggles served you well.~|~translationMissing
Although, these Sourhogs often live in primitive tribes. I fear that where there's one, there's likely to be more to follow.~|~translationMissing
We may have to monitor that lair from time to time to keep their population in check.~|~translationMissing
If the player has unlocked the ability to craft the slayer helmet~|~translationMissing
I've noticed that you've unlocked the ability to craft slayer helms. From now on, when assembling one, fasten a pair of Reinforced Goggles to the eye holes to gain their benefit.~|~translationMissing
While we're on the topic, I can upgrade any of your existing slayer helms now.~|~translationMissing
The screen briefly fades to black~|~translationMissing
That should do the trick.~|~translationMissing

Hi there.~|~translationMissing
Launa~|~translationMissing
What's this big hole in the ground all about?~|~translationMissing
Oh I wish I knew for sure... All I do know is that it opened seemingly by itself a few months ago. It was first discovered by the students over at the digsite, a few of which have gone down there but never returned.~|~translationMissing
They told me about it straight away.~|~translationMissing
So why is it important to you?~|~translationMissing
A few reasons, but I think the situation is beyond help now.~|~translationMissing
What situation? Maybe I can help.~|~translationMissing
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell you. I'm waiting to see my son Tolna. Don't suppose you've seen him?~|~translationMissing
Your son, Tolna? I don't know, what does he look like?~|~translationMissing
I don't really know.~|~translationMissing
You don't know what your own son looks like?~|~translationMissing
No. You see, I haven't seen him for... for... 25 years now. He just ran away one day and never returned. I'm hoping he's down this rift as I know he headed in this direction. My husband went to look, but he hasn't~|~translationMissing
returned for days.~|~translationMissing
Start the A Soul's Bane quest?~|~translationMissing
Would you like me to go down to look for your husband and son?~|~translationMissing
You would do that? Oh thank you so much!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry. I'll investigate.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. You can use a rope to get into the rift, just attach it at the edge.~|~translationMissing
No problem.~|~translationMissing
Be careful.~|~translationMissing
Surely by now they'd both be dead?~|~translationMissing
What?!?!~|~translationMissing
Oops.~|~translationMissing
How could you say such a thing? Get away from me!~|~translationMissing
Hi.~|~translationMissing
Have you discovered anything yet?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, what am I supposed to do again?~|~translationMissing
Go into the rift beside me and find my husband and son!~|~translationMissing
Ah, I'm on my way!~|~translationMissing
Tolna's Voice~|~translationMissing
Why should I, Tolna, be trapped in such a wretched place?~|~translationMissing
Arrghh, It's not fair! Feel my ANGER!~|~translationMissing
Which weapon would you like to take?~|~translationMissing
The Sword~|~translationMissing
(Player receives anger sword.)~|~translationMissing
The Spear~|~translationMissing
(Player receives anger spear.)~|~translationMissing
The Mace~|~translationMissing
(Player receives anger mace.)~|~translationMissing
The Battleaxe~|~translationMissing
(Player receives anger battleaxe.)~|~translationMissing
Nothing~|~translationMissing
(Player gives anger weapon.)~|~translationMissing
Do you wish to leave?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I don't mind starting this room again.~|~translationMissing
The player leaves to the entrance of the rift.~|~translationMissing
No, I'll finish this room first.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I've been down into the rift and I found a strange room. I also heard a voice claiming to be called Tolna.~|~translationMissing
My son! What did he say?~|~translationMissing
He said, 'Why should I, Tolna, be trapped in such a wretched place? Feel my ANGER!'.~|~translationMissing
Who can be surprised at his frustration?~|~translationMissing
It's a very aggressive room. I think I need to defeat the monsters in there.~|~translationMissing
Don't waste any time, his life could depend on you.~|~translationMissing
Arrrgghhh!~|~translationMissing
The player disperses demon-looking anger monsters from the room~|~translationMissing
Wow! How did I do that? There's something truly mental about this place!~|~translationMissing
Fade to black, a cutscene in Varrock to see young Launa and Tolna~|~translationMissing
Where are you going?~|~translationMissing
Tolna~|~translationMissing
I can't live with your rules any more, Mother.~|~translationMissing
I'm tired of working hard for very little money. There's great wealth that's mine for the taking!~|~translationMissing
But why? We're surviving perfectly fine on what we're earning.~|~translationMissing
I'm tired of your pathetic outlook. Good bye.~|~translationMissing
Tolna?~|~translationMissing
TOLNA?!!!~|~translationMissing
I managed to defeat the monsters in the room!~|~translationMissing
Have you found him then?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I've yet to enter the next room.~|~translationMissing
Please hurry!~|~translationMissing
It's so quiet and dark. I FEAR I may never escape this horrid place.~|~translationMissing
Mum, Dad, help me!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, no light sources. So why can I still see down here? This can't just be a simple dungeon.~|~translationMissing
Hi. I've made my way into a second room. I heard your son's voice again as well.~|~translationMissing
What did he say? What did he say?~|~translationMissing
'It's so quiet and dark. I FEAR I may never escape this horrid place. Mum, help me!'~|~translationMissing
You must save him! Help him get over his fear!~|~translationMissing
A random dialogue is selected from the following~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 1~|~translationMissing
Hello?~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 2~|~translationMissing
What's going on?~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 3~|~translationMissing
What on Gielinor?~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 4~|~translationMissing
Ahhhh~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 5~|~translationMissing
Help me!~|~translationMissing

Who's there?~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 8~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 9~|~translationMissing
Is anybody there?~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 10~|~translationMissing
I can't see!~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 11~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 12~|~translationMissing
Who's that?~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 13~|~translationMissing
I don't like looking in these holes but I must!~|~translationMissing
I don't feel quite so afraid now.~|~translationMissing
These holes aren't that spooky.~|~translationMissing
This isn't so scary after all!~|~translationMissing
The player kills the last scary face.~|~translationMissing
Phew, I don't feel so scared now. This feels like the figment of someone's imagination!~|~translationMissing
fade to black, to the location of the rift before it fully opened to see Tolna fall in~|~translationMissing
What's that?~|~translationMissing
I've overcome fear in the second room and an exit has been illuminated.~|~translationMissing
What can you see?~|~translationMissing
Erm, I haven't actually ventured through yet.~|~translationMissing
What are you waiting for? He must be so afraid in that place.~|~translationMissing
Where am I? How long have I been here? Am I still the person I once was?~|~translationMissing
Oh why am I so CONFUSED?~|~translationMissing
Hi, I've journeyed through to a third room. Your son's voice spoke as I entered.~|~translationMissing
Really? What did he say?~|~translationMissing
Simply, 'Where am I? How long have I been here? Am I still the person I once was? I hate my CONFUSION'.~|~translationMissing
You have to help him overcome his confusion!~|~translationMissing
Does this creature really exist?~|~translationMissing
That monster wasn't even real!~|~translationMissing
Those other monsters were just hallucinations!~|~translationMissing
Aha! The exit is now clear! This Tolna's mind really is a mess.~|~translationMissing
Leave me... But I don't want to... How can you say that...~|~translationMissing
I've done nothing wrong... Arrrghhh...~|~translationMissing
Hi. I have prevailed over a third room.~|~translationMissing
Are you any closer to finding my son?~|~translationMissing
I think I may be getting closer.~|~translationMissing
Please don't waste any time.~|~translationMissing
What's the point? No-one will ever help me.~|~translationMissing
I'm not worth anything. Will anyone ever combat my HOPELESSNESS?~|~translationMissing
I have travelled through to a fourth room. As I entered your son's voice spoke to me!~|~translationMissing
Oh my! What did he say?~|~translationMissing
He said, 'What's the point? Why do I defy such HOPELESSNESS? No-one will ever help me'.~|~translationMissing
You must fight to give him back his hope!~|~translationMissing
Can I succeed?~|~translationMissing
Of course you can!~|~translationMissing
Is there any end to killing these monsters?~|~translationMissing
This is hard work!~|~translationMissing
I've almost killed them all now!~|~translationMissing
Maybe if I kill one more?~|~translationMissing
A bridge of hope! Tolna should feel that help is at hand by now!~|~translationMissing
I have endured against hopelessness to finish the fourth room.~|~translationMissing
Any sight of my son?~|~translationMissing
Only his voice. So far he has said to me, 'Why should I, Tolna, be trapped in such a wretched place? Feel my ANGER!', 'It's so quiet and dark. I FEAR I may never escape this horrid place. Mum, help me!', 'Where~|~translationMissing
am I? How long have I been here? Am I still the person I once was? I hate my CONFUSION' and 'What's the point? Why do I defy such HOPELESSNESS? No-one will ever help me'.~|~translationMissing
You must find him and bring him back to me. Please, I beg you.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I will find him!~|~translationMissing
Brana~|~translationMissing
Son! Is that you?~|~translationMissing
Please speak to me! Tolna?~|~translationMissing
Why should I speak to you? Besides, I'm no longer the boy you once knew.~|~translationMissing
You'll always be my son!~|~translationMissing
No. Something evil in this dungeon has morphed my body and mind.~|~translationMissing
There must be a way.~|~translationMissing
Don't give up so easily!~|~translationMissing
Don't give up? You had your chance to help me, 25 years it's taken you!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but your mother and I...~|~translationMissing
tried so hard to find you!~|~translationMissing
Lies!~|~translationMissing
Ah, we have a visitor!~|~translationMissing
Your father isn't lying.~|~translationMissing
Hah! If that's the way you think, then you shall both die!~|~translationMissing
Are you ok?~|~translationMissing
Please! You must help my son! He's beyond sense.~|~translationMissing
But how can I help?~|~translationMissing
I take it you have travelled through the mental dilemmas of my son, as I have.~|~translationMissing
That's correct.~|~translationMissing
Now you must do what I cannot, conquer the physical dilemma!~|~translationMissing
I will try.~|~translationMissing
Thank you stranger.~|~translationMissing
I've found your son.~|~translationMissing
You have?~|~translationMissing
And your husband, but I'm afraid your son is no longer physically what he once was.~|~translationMissing
Can you save them?~|~translationMissing
I think I've saved your son.~|~translationMissing
Please talk to him, make sure he's OK!~|~translationMissing
I have returned your son to his normal state!~|~translationMissing
And you've spoken to him?!?~|~translationMissing
Er, no, sorry. I just came back here to tell you.~|~translationMissing
What are you waiting for, bring him back to me!~|~translationMissing
Sorry? What happened?~|~translationMissing
You've been trapped down here for years. I've come to rescue you on behalf of your parents.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah. I was looking for the legacy of a civilisation that used to live down here.~|~translationMissing
Son!~|~translationMissing
Father? Oh, I'm so sorry, can you ever forgive me?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'm just glad you're back to yourself. Are you OK?~|~translationMissing
I'm fine, my memories are slowly returning. How's mother?~|~translationMissing
She misses you dearly!~|~translationMissing
Where is she?~|~translationMissing
She's up at the surface waiting for you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you traveller, I'm glad my wife and I never gave up hope. We should return to her and tell her the good news.~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much. I truly owe you for your help.~|~translationMissing
I'm just glad I could help.~|~translationMissing
The player is transported to above surface.~|~translationMissing
Hello Tolna.~|~translationMissing
Hi. Thanks again for saving me, I'm so glad to be out of that horrible place. I was foolish to ignore my parents' warnings when I ran away that day. Luckily I've been able to patch things up with them so they've~|~translationMissing
returned home with peace of mind.~|~translationMissing
What exactly happened to you down there?~|~translationMissing
I managed to find the remnants of the ancient civilisation that the stories talked about. It seems people used to worship a god there years ago in numbers far greater than a simple cult following. Sadly there is little~|~translationMissing
remaining so I have nothing else to tell. As soon as I entered this area the ground swallowed me whole. I felt there was something watching, waiting. It's like there is some evil power under the ground that wanted me to~|~translationMissing
suffer. As if it got some sort of empowerment from it. At least what ever it is, it doesn't want to reveal itself to the world yet...~|~translationMissing
At least we have a warning. Did you manage to retrieve anything?~|~translationMissing
Not really, just a few coins, which you're welcome to have.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. So what are you going to do now?~|~translationMissing
I've decided to keep open the rift. There is a part of it that is perfectly laid out for combat training and remnants of my subconscious remain in there. I want to show people the problems I have faced, so that they~|~translationMissing
may learn from them. You're welcome to go down there and practice fighting any time.~|~translationMissing

Garth~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Interested in hearing the tale of Serafina?~|~translationMissing
Start the A Taste of Hope quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes please.~|~translationMissing
Great! Now, in case you didn't know, the castle before you is Ver Sinhaza. It's home to the Theatre of Blood.~|~translationMissing
So it's a form of entertainment for them? Why do the citizens take part?~|~translationMissing
The Theatre is run by a famous vampyre noble, Lady Verzik Vitur. She has promised that any citizen of Meiyerditch who survives the Theatre will be freed of the vampyre blood tithes.~|~translationMissing
I suppose that must be rather tempting to a lot of people. So who's this Serafina?~|~translationMissing
The Theatre has been around for many years and thousands of people have tried their luck against it. However, in all that time, only one person has ever survived until the end.~|~translationMissing
Serafina?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. Serafina's younger brother was very ill and he wasn't going to survive many more blood tithes. She couldn't just let him die, so she did what no other person ever had.~|~translationMissing
She entered the Theatre and succeeded in every challenge she faced. They say that Verzik wasn't too happy about that, but she kept her promise. Serafina and her brother were freed.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like you're a big fan of her.~|~translationMissing
Well of course. When she survived the Theatre, she provided hope to every person in Meiyerditch. Hope that they can one day follow in her footsteps.~|~translationMissing
So what happened to her in the end?~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose she left Meiyerditch. Can't imagine any free person wanting to stick around here.~|~translationMissing
You suppose? So you don't know for sure?~|~translationMissing
Well... No. It was a long time ago. Not many people around who remember it.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm...~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays in which Ranis Drakan and Vanstrom Klause arrive at Ver Sinhaza and enter the Theatre of Blood.~|~translationMissing
That was Vanstrom Klause and Ranis Drakan!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan and the Myreque will want to hear about this.~|~translationMissing
Not right now.~|~translationMissing
Safalaan Hallow~|~translationMissing
It's nice to see you again, [player name], and congratulations on your well deserved promotion!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan! I've seen something I think you should know about.~|~translationMissing
What is it, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I was at Ver Sinhaza and I saw Vanstrom Klause and Ranis Drakan.~|~translationMissing
What were they doing?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure, they arrived at the same time and both entered the castle.~|~translationMissing
Vertida Sefalatis~|~translationMissing
Ver Sinhaza is home to the Theatre of Blood. Maybe they were just there as spectators?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Ranis is known to visit the Theatre quite regularly. However, I've never heard of Vanstrom going there before. I'd say this is worth investigating.~|~translationMissing
What do you need from me?~|~translationMissing
Return to Ver Sinhaza and see if you can work out what Vanstrom and Ranis are up to. If you need some help, we recently sent a few of King Roald's mercenaries in that direction.~|~translationMissing
What do you need me to do again?~|~translationMissing
Go to Ver Sinhaza and see if you can work out what Vanstrom and Ranis are up to. We recently sent a few of King Roald's mercenaries in that direction, talk to them if you need help.~|~translationMissing
Mercenary~|~translationMissing
Hello. You don't look like the usual rabble around here. What's your story?~|~translationMissing
Safalaan sent me. He said you could help me with something.~|~translationMissing
Ahh Safalaan. Interesting chap isn't he? Those eyes of his are a bit creepy.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, we might be able to help but it will need to be quick. We're just about to head into the Theatre. Compared to the citizens, we shouldn't have any issues in there.~|~translationMissing
So what help do you need?~|~translationMissing
I saw Vanstrom Klause and Ranis Drakan arriving at the castle earlier. Do you know if they're still here?~|~translationMissing
Yeah we saw them as well. Pretty hard to miss. We haven't seen them leave yet so I guess they're still inside.~|~translationMissing
I need to know what they're doing in there. Any idea how I can do that?~|~translationMissing
Well this place has quite a few windows. Maybe you could use one of them. They're all high up though so you'd need to climb to reach them.~|~translationMissing
Aye that might work. Parts of the castle wall have been damaged, it shouldn't be too hard to climb.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Did you manage to work out what Vanstrom and Ranis are up to?~|~translationMissing
You might be able to spy on them through one of the windows. You'll need to climb to reach them though.~|~translationMissing
Get away from there food sack.~|~translationMissing
Doesn't look like I'll be able to climb up here with that guard watching. I'll need to distract them somehow.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I was wondering if you could help me with something.~|~translationMissing
Harpert~|~translationMissing
Do you think you could distract that guard for me while I climb this wall?~|~translationMissing
I ain't getting on the wrong side of a vyrewatch for nothing. You'll have to pay me.~|~translationMissing
Eugh fine. How much?~|~translationMissing
1,000 coins should do.~|~translationMissing
1,000 coins? What can you even buy around here for that?~|~translationMissing
There's a guy in sector three who sells weapons. Top secret, the vampyres can't know about it. I want to buy a sword from him so I have a better chance in the Theatre.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 1000 coins~|~translationMissing
Fine. I'll come back when I have the money.~|~translationMissing
Fine, here's the money.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. Climb the wall when you're ready. I'll distract the guard when you do.~|~translationMissing
I'm not paying.~|~translationMissing
Do you have my money yet?~|~translationMissing
Hand it over then.~|~translationMissing
Climb the wall when you're ready. I'll distract the guard when you do.~|~translationMissing
Hey vampyre! Over here!~|~translationMissing
You climb up the wall while the vampyre is distracted.~|~translationMissing
...and you believe this creature will be suitable?~|~translationMissing
I have no doubt that it will adequately meet your requirements.~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom Klause~|~translationMissing
Perhaps. But I still believe the vyrewatch can handle this.~|~translationMissing
We've given your vyrewatch more than enough opportunities and yet the Myreque still elude us. It's time for another strategy.~|~translationMissing
The creature before you has advantages over a vyre. It is the perfect hunter. Once it gets a taste of its foes blood, it can track them anywhere.~|~translationMissing
We'd still need the blood though.~|~translationMissing
I may have a solution to that, if this is indeed the route we're taking. There is also the question of your sister. She's specifically requested that Safalaan and that outsider be left to her.~|~translationMissing
Now is not the time for her games. We can't afford to let the enemy slip through our fingers again.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you worry about the Myreque. I'll handle Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom faces east, seemingly toward where you are spying on.~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom?~|~translationMissing
Hmm?~|~translationMissing
Very well, I will make preparations immediately. The sooner we deal with the Myreque the better. Even our kind have weaknesses and if Serafina could discover them, the Myreque can as well.~|~translationMissing
Then I think we're done here. Thank you for your time Verzik.~|~translationMissing
And thank you Ranis. You're always welcome here.~|~translationMissing
Well that didn't sound good. I'd better let Safalaan know.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, [player name]. Do you have any news for us?~|~translationMissing
I do. It's not good I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
I managed to spy on a meeting between Vanstrom, Ranis and Verzik Vitur. Verzik gifted them this strange creature which she said would help them track down the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Track down the Myreque? How?~|~translationMissing
She claimed that the creature could track anyone provided it got a taste of their blood.~|~translationMissing
So they'd still need blood from one of us? We might be okay then. It's not like the vampyres name and number the tithes they take.~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't be so sure. Vanstrom seemed to think he had a way around that. Not only that, it sounded like he'd be making his move very soon.~|~translationMissing
This isn't good. If Vanstrom thinks he can use this creature against us, I have no reason to disbelieve him. He's proven time and time again that he should not be underestimated.~|~translationMissing
So what's our plan?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure yet. We'll need to make one quickly though.~|~translationMissing
Can I help with anything?~|~translationMissing
Vertida and I will begin forming a plan of action. In the meantime, do you remember that book on haemalchemy you found for us?~|~translationMissing
I do.~|~translationMissing
Well our head researcher, Flaygian Screwte, has been working on translating it. Could you check up on him and see how things are going?~|~translationMissing
Remind me.~|~translationMissing
Following a hint given to you by Sarius Guile, Vanescula Drakan's servant, you found a secret laboratory beneath Meiyerditch. Inside you found a book on haemalchemy.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. So, what's happening with this book?~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Safalaan said you were working on translating the haemalchemy book.~|~translationMissing
Flaygian Screwte~|~translationMissing
Indeed I am. It's not a quick process I'm afraid. Large parts of the book are written using the vampyric language which isn't easy to translate.~|~translationMissing
I didn't know the vampyres had their own language.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. It seems to be very old and they don't use it much anymore but it does exist. I suspect it comes in quite useful for things like this where they don't want humans prying into their work.~|~translationMissing
But you can translate it? How's that going so far?~|~translationMissing
Like I say, it's slow. My knowledge on the language only comes from things I've seen around the city so I'm having to make a lot of assumptions. I'm making progress though.~|~translationMissing
Anything to report?~|~translationMissing
The book seems to document a lot of the experiments being performed in that lab you found. Interestingly, the experiments were performed on vampyres themselves, as well as humans.~|~translationMissing
It appears that they were trying to use the power of haemalchemy to modify both humans and vampyres.~|~translationMissing
What is haemalchemy?~|~translationMissing
There are some that believe there is a hidden power in blood. Haemalchemy is the act of modifying blood, both magically and scientifically, to harness this power.~|~translationMissing
It seems that the vampyres are strong believers in the power of haemalchemy as they've been experimenting quite heavily.~|~translationMissing
It looks like they had two reasons. First of all they were looking for a way to increase the amount of blood that can be harvested from a human.~|~translationMissing
Unsurprisingly, the vampyres here have multiplied much faster than the humans. Perhaps there's no longer enough blood to go around.~|~translationMissing
And the other reason?~|~translationMissing
That's the more interesting one. As we're already aware, vampyres possess some form of immunity against our attacks.~|~translationMissing
It starts off as only partial in juveniles and juvinates but by the time they become vyres they are totally invulnerable.~|~translationMissing
This book implies that the vampyres immunity isn't perfect and that it can be overcome. It seems they were trying to improve this immunity.~|~translationMissing
Overcome? How?~|~translationMissing
I haven't got that far yet I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. I might actually be able to help with that bit. I was spying on Vanstrom and Ranis earlier for Safalaan and I heard Vanstrom say something quite interesting.~|~translationMissing
What did he say?~|~translationMissing
He implied that Serafina had discovered their weakness.~|~translationMissing
Serafina? As in the Serafina who survived the Theatre of Blood?~|~translationMissing
I believe so.~|~translationMissing
That would actually make a lot of sense. We've always wondered how Serafina managed to survive all of the challenges in the Theatre.~|~translationMissing
But what if she never needed to? Maybe she took advantage of the vampyres weakness and forced them to let her leave?~|~translationMissing
Do you think this is worth exploring?~|~translationMissing
I do. I'll stay here and keep working on this book. You head out and see if you can find out what Serafina discovered. Safalaan should be able to help you.~|~translationMissing
What do I need to do again?~|~translationMissing
We need to find out what Serafina discovered about the vampyres. Talk to Safalaan, he should be able to help you.~|~translationMissing
Hi Safalaan. How are things going?~|~translationMissing
Not good I'm afraid, [player name]. We've looked over our options and we can't see any solution to this problem. If the vampyres truly have the ability to track us then we won't be safe anywhere in Morytania.~|~translationMissing
So what do we do?~|~translationMissing
We'll have to leave. We should be able to sneak out of Meiyerditch using the same route you did.~|~translationMissing
We can meet up with Veliaf and the rest of the Myreque in Burgh de Rott. Once we're all together, we can travel to Paterdomus and cross the Salve into Misthalin.~|~translationMissing
Retreat to Misthalin? But what about all the people here that need our help? They'll die without us.~|~translationMissing
I know it's not ideal, but we can't help anyone if we're dead. The only place we'll be safe from this new threat is on the other side of the Salve.~|~translationMissing
There must be another way. What about Roald's mercenaries? Can't they help us?~|~translationMissing
Even with their help the vampyres outnumber us ten to one. The only reason we've survived this long is by hiding in the shadows. Once the vampyres know where we are, we'll be doomed.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, [player name]. This isn't the end of our fight though. Once we're in Misthalin we can build up our strength and find more support. We'll come back stronger than ever before.~|~translationMissing
So when do we leave?~|~translationMissing
It will take a while to pack up all of our equipment but we aim to be gone as soon as possible.~|~translationMissing
Do you think there's time for one last job before we go?~|~translationMissing
I guess that depends what it is.~|~translationMissing
While translating the haemalchemy book, Flaygian found reference to a possible weakness in the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
Not only that, I also heard Vanstrom talking about this same weakness. He implied that Serafina found a way to take advantage of it.~|~translationMissing
Serafina? I suspect she's nothing more than a myth. A tale fabricated by the vampyres to drive people to that Theatre of theirs.~|~translationMissing
But this came from Vanstrom himself.~|~translationMissing
That is a valid point I guess. Old Man Ral used to tell plenty of stories about Serafina and he did once tell me where she apparently lived.~|~translationMissing
I suppose we have time to go and have a quick look around while the others pack everything up here.~|~translationMissing
So where do we go?~|~translationMissing
You'll find the house in sector four. To get there, leave the base, head north and then head west. Go all the way to the western wall and you'll find a broken fountain. The house is the one directly south of the fountain.~|~translationMissing
It's best that we travel separately so you head out first and I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
How can I find the house again?~|~translationMissing
You'll find it in sector four. To get there, leave the base, head north and then head west. Go all the way to the western wall and you'll find a broken fountain. The house is the one directly south of the fountain.~|~translationMissing
This looks like the fountain that Safalaan mentioned. Serafina's house must be this one to the south.~|~translationMissing
So this is where Serafina lived. Or so they claim.~|~translationMissing
Everyone else I've spoken to looks up to Serafina, but you don't even think she was real.~|~translationMissing
I guess it's not about if she was real or not. It's about what she is now. A symbol. A false one.~|~translationMissing
Every day, citizens of Meiyerditch throw their lives away in that damn Theatre. All because of her.~|~translationMissing
But why don't they fight with the Myreque instead?~|~translationMissing
I guess they don't think the vampyres will ever be beaten. They believe that joining the Myreque will lead to certain death.~|~translationMissing
Thanks to Serafina, they believe that they at least have a chance with the Theatre.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'm getting distracted. There's a locked door here that might be hiding what we're looking for. Let's see if we can find a way to open it.~|~translationMissing
We should keep looking.~|~translationMissing
I found a herb. It's not a type I recognise.~|~translationMissing
Maybe a potion is needed. See if you can make one. You can get some water from the broken fountain outside.~|~translationMissing
How odd. We should see if we can find anything else.~|~translationMissing
I found some ingredients and started making a potion with them.~|~translationMissing
A potion? See if you can finish it off.~|~translationMissing
I found some ingredients and made a potion with them.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. Maybe there's something you can use it with.~|~translationMissing
The door has an inscription on it.~|~translationMissing
What does it say?~|~translationMissing
'Blood is the price of victory.'~|~translationMissing
Blood? Maybe haemalchemy is involved here. We should keep looking around.~|~translationMissing
I found some ingredients for a potion. I made it and tried using it with the door but nothing happened. I also found an inscription on the door.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I wonder...~|~translationMissing
What are you thinking?~|~translationMissing
I have an idea that may work. Bring me an empty vial.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an empty vial~|~translationMissing
What are you doing?~|~translationMissing
'Blood is the price of victory.' Now try making the potion with this. If my suspicions are correct it should work.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Vial of blood.)~|~translationMissing
Fine. Next time please warn me before you start cutting yourself.~|~translationMissing
Do you have that vial?~|~translationMissing
Well bring one to me. I have an idea.~|~translationMissing
Could I have another vial of blood.~|~translationMissing
I don't have unlimited blood you know! Use the one you've got.~|~translationMissing
I hope you don't think I have unlimited blood to spare. Bring me another vial and try not to lose this one.~|~translationMissing
Give Saflaan the vial?~|~translationMissing
You hand the empty vial to Safalaan who uses his blade to fill it with his own blood.~|~translationMissing
Please be more careful with this one. I'd rather not die of blood loss.~|~translationMissing
Any luck with that potion?~|~translationMissing
Keep at it.~|~translationMissing
I've got a finished potion here.~|~translationMissing
Well try using it with the door. If my suspicions are correct it should work.~|~translationMissing
It worked this time. The door is unlocked.~|~translationMissing
Good work. Hopefully there's something useful behind it.~|~translationMissing
I found some old notes behind the door.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Hopefully they contain something useful. We should head back to the hideout and give them to Flaygian. I can take them if you want?~|~translationMissing
Here you go.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. We should head back to the hideout.~|~translationMissing
I'll look after them.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. Just make sure they get to Flaygian at the hideout.~|~translationMissing
I think we're all done here. We should head back to the hideout.~|~translationMissing
How are things looking Vertida?~|~translationMissing
All of the essentials are packed up and ready to go.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Let the others know that we'll be leaving shortly.~|~translationMissing
I... I don't understand...~|~translationMissing
What is it, Flaygian?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking through these notes you found but there's nothing here.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean nothing?~|~translationMissing
As in nothing. It's just a load of rubbish. Why would Serafina have written this?~|~translationMissing
Because she might not have been the one to write it. [player name], what was it that Verzik said about this creature Vanstrom is using?~|~translationMissing
That it can track anyone if it has a taste of their blood.~|~translationMissing
And when we were at Serafina's home, we used our blood to open that door.~|~translationMissing
You don't mean...~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom! He used us as bait. Vertida, get the others. We need to leave now!~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays in which the abomination attacks the Myreque Hideout.~|~translationMissing
Mekritus A'hara~|~translationMissing
Oh f...~|~translationMissing
The abomination kills Mekritus.~|~translationMissing
Kael Forshaw~|~translationMissing
Mekritus!~|~translationMissing
The abomination knocks Kael back.~|~translationMissing
Andiess Juip~|~translationMissing
Time to die beast!~|~translationMissing
The abomination kills Andiess, and moves towards the end of the hideout.~|~translationMissing
Flaygian look out!~|~translationMissing
The abomination kills Flaygian.~|~translationMissing
No! Flaygian!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan charges his hidden power.~|~translationMissing
What's happening? Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
Safalaan unleashes his hidden power, weakening the abomination.~|~translationMissing
It's weakened! Let's finish it off!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan! Are you okay?~|~translationMissing
I'll be fine. Now we need to get out of here before Vanstrom and his vampyres turn up.~|~translationMissing
[player name], we have an old hideout beneath Old Man Ral's house in southern Meiyerditch. Meet us there.~|~translationMissing
Mekritus... Andiess... Flaygian... How many more need to die to those monsters?~|~translationMissing
Are you okay, Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
I knew Serafina was a lie. But I wanted so hard to believe. To believe that someone could have actually beaten those vampyres.~|~translationMissing
But I was naive and people died because of it.~|~translationMissing
More would have died if not for you. Your magic weakened that thing. We would never have been able to kill it without that.~|~translationMissing
What was that magic?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I don't know. It's a power I've had for as long as I can remember. I've never been able to control it though, it only seems to come on when I'm angry or threatened.~|~translationMissing
How strange.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. I wish I could tell you more about it but I don't actually remember much about the times it has happened. It's like I have these blank spots in my memory.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, now is not the time to dwell on it.~|~translationMissing
So what's the plan boss?~|~translationMissing
We should make our way to Burgh de Rott and meet up with Veliaf and the others.~|~translationMissing
You mean we're still leaving?~|~translationMissing
What other choice do we have?~|~translationMissing
I just lost some very good friends of mine. I can't walk away from that. The vampyres need to pay.~|~translationMissing
We all nearly died back there. I don't intend to throw any more lives away today. We are leaving.~|~translationMissing
Just think for a second though. The vampyres will probably think we all died in the attack. They'll have dropped their guard. Now is the best time to retaliate.~|~translationMissing
That is a good point.~|~translationMissing
It is. However, in case you'd forgotten, we don't have anything to retaliate with. Serafina was a lie, just another one of Vanstrom's little plots.~|~translationMissing
We have no weapon to use against the vampyres. And with Flaygian gone, that won't be changing.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I think you might be wrong there.~|~translationMissing
Flaygian managed to translate some more of the haemalchemy book while you two were investigating Serafina.~|~translationMissing
We never got the chance to look over his new discoveries before the attack. However, I did recover his notes as we left.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... All right. [player name], work with Vertida and see if you can finish off Flaygian's work. Make no mistake though, if this doesn't come to anything then we will be leaving.~|~translationMissing
Hello Vertida.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Here are the notes Flaygian made. Have a read through and let me know if you need any help.~|~translationMissing
Do you need any help with Flaygian's notes?~|~translationMissing
I need the Rod of Ivandis~|~translationMissing
I imagine you'd know more about that than me. Weren't you the one who remade it?~|~translationMissing
I was but I gave it to Veliaf.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm sure he still has it. You should ask him if you can have it back. Alternatively, you could always make another.~|~translationMissing
Do you need anything else?~|~translationMissing
(Shows previous options)~|~translationMissing
I need some chain~|~translationMissing
Check the crates around here, we should have some chain lying around.~|~translationMissing
I need an enchanted silver sickle~|~translationMissing
Well we have some blessed silver sickles in storage here. You should check the crates. What kind of enchantment does it need?~|~translationMissing
An emerald enchantment~|~translationMissing
Well you'll need to get an emerald and attach it to the sickle. You'll be needing a chisel to do that. Once you've attached the emerald, you should be able to enchant the sickle using an enchantment spell.~|~translationMissing
No thank you~|~translationMissing
Hello Vertida. I've finished the weapon.~|~translationMissing
Great work. You should let Safalaan know.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf Hurtz~|~translationMissing
Hello Veliaf.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if I could ask a favour?~|~translationMissing
Of cause, ask away.~|~translationMissing
Would it be possible for me to have the Rod of Ivandis back?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the Rod of Ivandis in their inventory~|~translationMissing
What do you need it for?~|~translationMissing
I want to convert it into a flail. I have reason to believe that will make it even more effective against vampyres.~|~translationMissing
If the player has one free inventory space~|~translationMissing
Well I can hardly say no to that. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
If the player has no free inventory space~|~translationMissing
Well I'd be happy to help but you don't have enough room for it.~|~translationMissing
If the player already have one in the inventory~|~translationMissing
Looks like you have one right there.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah, how didn't I notice.~|~translationMissing
If the player already claimed one from Veliaf~|~translationMissing
But I already gave it to you.~|~translationMissing
I lost it.~|~translationMissing
Well you'll just have to make another then. That was the only one I had.~|~translationMissing
Hopefully Flaygain's work will help us against the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
Good news Safalaan, the weapon is complete.~|~translationMissing
About time we had some good news. Great work.~|~translationMissing
Well I wasn't convinced at first but it turns out you were right. The vampyres seem to believe we're all dead. That's not all though, tell them Kael.~|~translationMissing
Ranis Drakan himself has sent an open invitation to the people of Meiyerditch, inviting them to Ver Sinhaza.~|~translationMissing
Apparently he intends to officially announce the defeat of the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
This is quite possibly one of the best opportunities we've ever been given. Ranis Drakan is brother to Lowerniel Drakan himself and is one of the most senior figures in vampyric society.~|~translationMissing
And for the first time, we have a weapon that could actually defeat him.~|~translationMissing
Exactly. This is our chance to bring real hope to these people. The death of any vampyre would send a strong message but the death of Ranis Drakan could change everything.~|~translationMissing
You don't need to convince me. It's time to show these monsters that their days are done.~|~translationMissing
[player name], you are not a citizen of Meiyerditch. You have never felt the pain that these people have. And yet, you have fought for them all the same.~|~translationMissing
Now I must ask that you fight for them again. You are the most experienced amongst us. You have the best chance of defeating Ranis.~|~translationMissing
I've come this far. I'm not about to leave now. What's our plan.~|~translationMissing
Take the new weapon and head to Ver Sinhaza. Kael will meet you there. Wait until Ranis has begun his speech, that will be the best time to strike.~|~translationMissing
I won't let you down.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Hello, player. I'll be leaving for Ver Sinhaza soon. You should meet me there.~|~translationMissing
Hello, player. You'd better get moving. Ranis will be starting his speech soon.~|~translationMissing
I need another flail.~|~translationMissing
Well I have made a few more. I suppose I could let you have one. I'll have to charge you though, some of this stuff isn't easy to get hold of.~|~translationMissing
How much?~|~translationMissing
20,000 coins should do it.~|~translationMissing
Buy an Ivandis Flail for 20,000 coins?~|~translationMissing
Sounds good to me. I'll take it.~|~translationMissing
Here you go. Put it to good use~|~translationMissing
(If full inventory)~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid you don't have enough room for it. Come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
That's a bit too much for me. I guess I'll make myself another one instead.~|~translationMissing
(Insufficent coins)~|~translationMissing
I don't have that much on me.~|~translationMissing
I'll be here when you do.~|~translationMissing
Good bye~|~translationMissing
Well met, [player name]. Ranis will be starting his speech soon. Are you ready?~|~translationMissing
I'm ready.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Well just let me know when you are.~|~translationMissing
Citizens of Meiyerditch! I stand before you today so that we may share in a moment of triumph!~|~translationMissing
For years, the Myreque have lurked in the shadows of this city! Their acts of defiance tainting the greatness that we have all achieved together!~|~translationMissing
Today, that defiance finally came to an end! Today, we entered the home of the Myreque and eradicated their kind!~|~translationMissing
Our efforts today would not have been possible without every single one of you. The blood you provide ensures that we remain ever capable of facing these threats.~|~translationMissing
For that, you should all be proud.~|~translationMissing
However, while today is very much a day of celebration, it should also act as a reminder.~|~translationMissing
Rebellion. Resistance. Defiance. These are not the path to freedom. They are merely the path to death.~|~translationMissing
Anyone who wishes to be free of this life should instead look to Serafina.~|~translationMissing
Follow in her footsteps. Enter the Theatre and survive. Do this and freedom will be yours.~|~translationMissing
As good as all of that sounds, I do have just a few issues with it.~|~translationMissing
What is this?~|~translationMissing
You stand here claiming the Myreque are dead but I'm here to prove otherwise.~|~translationMissing
For too long you have lorded yourself over these people. Today, that comes to an end. Today...~|~translationMissing
...you die.~|~translationMissing
You know, over the course of my life, I have tasted more blood than you could ever imagine. The variety of flavours is incredible, and yet, there's one taste that all others pale in comparison to.~|~translationMissing
You see, there's nothing sweeter than a taste of hope. And you're full of it.~|~translationMissing
I'm going to enjoy killing you.~|~translationMissing
I take it you killed that abomination then? It was a human once you know. How does that feel?~|~translationMissing
He was doomed. With his illness he'd have soon died with or without our tithing. We saved him, just like she wanted. All for you to just kill him!~|~translationMissing
She was one of the smart ones. She was willing! Saving him was all that mattered. She was ready to sacrifice anything for that.~|~translationMissing
It's a shame her mind is no longer there. One of the negatives of the process unfortunately. Otherwise I'd have introduced you. I'm sure she'd have loved to meet her brother's killer.~|~translationMissing
Sooo... I guess this is the part where I say something...~|~translationMissing
Well...~|~translationMissing
For hundreds of years, the people of Morytania have suffered under Lord Lowerniel Drakan and his vampyres.~|~translationMissing
For too long, they've filled you with false hope. Hope of freedom. All you have to do is follow Serafina and you'll be free. Or so they claim.~|~translationMissing
Well whoever Serafina was, she is gone. There is no freedom in that Theatre. No hope. Just lies. If freedom is truly what you want, there is another path.~|~translationMissing
You see, the vampyres are not as powerful as they'd have you believe. Ranis Drakan lies dead before you. Killed by a mere human. If he can die, so can the rest.~|~translationMissing
So now, I ask that you join us. Fight alongside the Myreque and together, we will push back the darkness of Hallowvale.~|~translationMissing
Together, we will end the tyranny of the Drakan family. Together, we will bring hope to all of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Myreque prevail!~|~translationMissing
That was amazing, [player name]. Now you'd better get back to the hideout. This place will be filled with vampyres soon.~|~translationMissing
Good news Safalaan, Ranis Drakan is no more!~|~translationMissing
I've already heard. The whole city is talking about it.~|~translationMissing
[player name], it can never be understated what you have done today. This is the turning of the tide in our battle and it's all down to you.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Safalaan. What happens now?~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel Drakan is unlikely to ignore the death of his brother. He will do everything he can to destroy us. I don't expect things to be easy for us from here.~|~translationMissing
However, thanks to you, we should hopefully see more support for our own cause. You've finally given these people something to fight for. Something real.~|~translationMissing
We'll start planning what our next steps should be right away. You can leave that to us though, you've earnt a break.~|~translationMissing
Also, it seems only right that you are rewarded for what you've done today. I can't offer much but I do have this tome of knowledge that might come in useful. I think Kael has something for you as well.~|~translationMissing
That's right. I recovered this medallion from Ranis, you might find a good use for it.~|~translationMissing
Kael shows you Ranis Drakan's medallion.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, we'll let you get off. And once again, [player name], thank you.~|~translationMissing
Do you have another Drakan's medallion?~|~translationMissing
How are things around here?~|~translationMissing
Much better thanks to you. It actually feels like we're winning for once.~|~translationMissing
Glad to hear it.~|~translationMissing
See you later.~|~translationMissing
Good to have you here, player.Everthing seems to feel more positive when you're around.~|~translationMissing
I need another flail~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays, showing Ranis' corpse. Vanescula Drakan and Vanstrom Klause approach the body.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... Lord Drakan won't be pleased about this.~|~translationMissing

Hello there and welcome to my humble abode. It's sadly rather more humble than I'd like, to be honest, although perhaps you can help with that?~|~translationMissing
I would be happy to make your home a better place.~|~translationMissing
Great, will I be able to take a nap in it?~|~translationMissing
What I need is simple~|~translationMissing
a couple of undead chickens. You should be able to pick some up at the farm near Port Phasmatys.~|~translationMissing
Very well then, I shall await my mystery prize with bated breath.~|~translationMissing
I'm not much into interior design, to tell the truth.~|~translationMissing
Very well, I suppose I'll just have to resort to the Professor's patented sleeping aid in order to get some rest. It does so bruise my head, though.~|~translationMissing
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?~|~translationMissing
I'm not a nice girl. I'm a respectable scientist researching the interactions between ghosts and the force of pure science.~|~translationMissing
I took over the position of assistant the the Professor upstairs, although, to be honest, his methods are somewhat eccentric. Did you head about the Ernest scandal?~|~translationMissing
You don't know the half of it - can you believe that he thinks he has proven Goldbach's First Conjecture using an optimised segmented sieve?~|~translationMissing
Er, quite, Yes.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing? I'm not ticklish.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing? Yuck, dead things.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing? Do I look that thin?~|~translationMissing
What are you doing? Trying to infect me with some vile disease?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure what you are trying to do, are you sure you aren't slightly deranged?~|~translationMissing
Alice~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What are you selling?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you give me any Farming advice?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm okay, thank you.~|~translationMissing
I'm here about a quest.~|~translationMissing
I am after one of your, er, unhealthier poultry. Could you help me?~|~translationMissing
You need those useless, undead chickens? How odd you adventurers are.~|~translationMissing
You need to talk to my husband, though - not that I can these days.~|~translationMissing
Whyever would this be?~|~translationMissing
Can't you see, he is dead. I can't talk to the dead.~|~translationMissing
Your animals don't look too healthy.~|~translationMissing
Malcolm~|~translationMissing
It's that fountain thingy in the temple to the east. It's turned them all into zombies.~|~translationMissing
What use are zombie animals?~|~translationMissing
None at all, mate, except that those worshippers at that temple keep comin' and killin' 'em all for their bones. Don't ask me why.~|~translationMissing
But you're a ghost - surely you know something about it.~|~translationMissing
I don't know nuthin' about nuthin'. Oim a simple ghost with simple needs. All I know is, years ago, that temple started glowing green and, a few months later, I woke up dead. That's all there is to it.~|~translationMissing
Would I be able to buy some of your chickens?~|~translationMissing
Talk to my wife and I'll think about it.~|~translationMissing
'Ave you talked to my wife for me?~|~translationMissing
I have a message from your husband. He wants you to know that he still loves you, despite his ghostly state.~|~translationMissing
Tell him I love him but I can't find our savings. I know he had our collection of gold and 'prize cow' rosettes just before the curse struck.~|~translationMissing
Have you spoken to my husband yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm working on it~|~translationMissing
Your wife says she needs the family cash and wants to know what you did with it.~|~translationMissing
Tell 'er I spent it on cheap spirits, har har.~|~translationMissing
Your sense of humour died too, it seems...~|~translationMissing
Hah, just trying to lift your spirits.~|~translationMissing
I rest my case.~|~translationMissing
Suit yerself, stick-in-the-mud. Anyway, Oim not one o' them yokels. Tell 'er I putted the cash in the bank like she always told me to.~|~translationMissing
A warning to ya, too~|~translationMissing
annoy her and I'll haunt ya till yer hair turns white.~|~translationMissing
Any luck wiv me wife?~|~translationMissing
Nothing new, no.~|~translationMissing
I'm here about that quest.~|~translationMissing
Your husband says he put the cash in the bank.~|~translationMissing
I'll need his bank pass, in that case.~|~translationMissing
Can't you just take a ghostspeak amulet? Then you could talk to him directly.~|~translationMissing
I tried that once, but all those other ghosts - and even the undead chickens and cows - scared me so much. I wouldn't try it again for all the cash in Varrock bank.~|~translationMissing
Have you asked him about the bank pass?~|~translationMissing
You may not believe me, but she wants me to find your bank pass now.~|~translationMissing
Maybe she said that, maybe she didn't. I think you're just after me savings. Tell 'er that no one but a fool gives away their pass numbers.~|~translationMissing
Go tell 'er now, if you're not a double-dealin' scammer, that is.~|~translationMissing
'Ave you talked to 'er?~|~translationMissing
Not since we last spoke.~|~translationMissing
He says he won't trust me with the bank pass.~|~translationMissing
What if I gave some sort of altered ghostspeak amulet to him - surely that would work?~|~translationMissing
I'll see if I can find her. Big nose and a monstrous hat, I assume? I wonder where the beautiful young witches hide...~|~translationMissing
Mysterious indeed, but in this case she actually looks pretty normal.~|~translationMissing
Have you found a way for me to talk to my husband yet?~|~translationMissing
I've not progressed at all, I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
I'm here about the farmers east of here.~|~translationMissing
Alice and her husband are having trouble talking to one another and said you might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Old crone~|~translationMissing
Alice seems to think you could alter a ghostspeak amulet in order to allow them to communicate.~|~translationMissing
You seem to have one of her golden hairs on your shoulder, so I can use that...~|~translationMissing
In a flash, the crone whisks away an unseen hair from your shoulder.~|~translationMissing
Talk to me again with a ghostspeak amulet and some space in your backpack and I'll be ready to work on this little good deed. The way I plan is quite simple, really.~|~translationMissing
I can mirror part of the unused mystical essence of the ghostspeak amulet, bind it with Alice's hair and thus create a second amulet.~|~translationMissing
The second amulet will be useful for the purpose you desire, though it won't work for any other ghost or human other than the farmer and his wife.~|~translationMissing
I'm here to see if you are ready to do your mystical stuff with my ghostspeak amulet.~|~translationMissing
I most certainly am, but you don't have an ghostspeak amulet.~|~translationMissing
I most certainly am, but you don't have space in your backpack.~|~translationMissing
Wow, that was quick and painless.~|~translationMissing
Just being a good neighbour.~|~translationMissing
Would you be able to replace the amulet you made? I seem to have lost it.~|~translationMissing
Well, to tell the truth, I just came back to chat with you. Any news?~|~translationMissing
Old Crone~|~translationMissing
Have you handed him an enhanced amulet?~|~translationMissing
I talked to your wife and thought that if you had a special amulet, you could speak to her and sort out the bank situation without me being involved.~|~translationMissing
Arr, that makes far more sense than I was expecting from a muscle-head like you. My wife's a clever one.~|~translationMissing
Well... oh, never mind. I'm desperate enough for those chickens to let that pass.~|~translationMissing
Give me that amulet, then, and we'll be seeing about your unnatural desire for chickens.~|~translationMissing
Okay, you need it more than I do, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Ta, mate.~|~translationMissing
Lucky we had such a brilliant idea.~|~translationMissing
I don't think I'm ready to hand it over yet.~|~translationMissing
Ahhh, many thanks. Now what was it you were wanting again?~|~translationMissing
I need a couple of your chickens.~|~translationMissing
Chickens is tricksy, 'specially dead 'uns. I'll have to catch 'em for ye.~|~translationMissing
Stand back while I catches 'em, ya city slicker.~|~translationMissing
Here, chicky chicky!~|~translationMissing
Git 'ere, yer pesky bird!~|~translationMissing
Where'd she go?~|~translationMissing
Git orf my laaand!~|~translationMissing
You heard my husband~|~translationMissing
leave now!~|~translationMissing
Cow31337Killer~|~translationMissing
You killed Bessie!~|~translationMissing
Sneaky undead fowl~|~translationMissing
Woo woo woo!~|~translationMissing
Well, that's one way to catch a chicken, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Hello, how can I help you? I'm sellin' if you have ecto- tokens.~|~translationMissing
Could I buy those chickens now, then?~|~translationMissing
Could I buy those chickens now?~|~translationMissing
I can hand over a chicken if you give me 10 of them ecto-token thingies per bird.~|~translationMissing
Could I buy 1 chicken now?~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing. edit)~|~translationMissing
Could I buy 2 chickens?~|~translationMissing
Great! I'm laying away me tokens for some killer cows. That'll learn them bone rustlers.~|~translationMissing
Har har, how many ghost chicky farmers d'you know, den?~|~translationMissing
I'm okay, thank you.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get these ecto-tokens?~|~translationMissing
The ghosts I talk to say that the tokens have something to do with the tower just east of here. If you need to collect some I'd try there.~|~translationMissing
My spiritometric devices show that you have been in close contact with ghostly animals. Are we closer to success?~|~translationMissing
Here they are.~|~translationMissing
Amazing! Success! I can look forward to some good nights' sleep after all.~|~translationMissing
Can I ask exactly how an undead chicken will help you sleep?~|~translationMissing
Well, I need the feathers to make my bed more comfortable. A comfortable bed will help me sleep. Obvious, really.~|~translationMissing
Obvious, yes, but why on Gielinor would you need an undead chicken when there are perfectly good live chickens just down the road?~|~translationMissing
Seeing as how you ranger types use so many feathers in your arrows, I was thinking I could harness an undead chicken to make an unending supply of arrow flights for you.~|~translationMissing
Beats chicken slaying or hanging around in fishing shops, I suppose. So, what next?~|~translationMissing
We'll need a magnet next, one with purely natural fields and made from a carefully selected iron bar. A firm impact when the iron is parallel to Gielinor's field will stabilise this field in the rod.~|~translationMissing
Go and talk to the Witch next door.~|~translationMissing
Well, I can buy the ones you want but I don't have any on me.~|~translationMissing
Stunning. I should have tried to hire some gnomes instead. They may be obsessed with their bellies but they can at least be trusted to deliver unpleasant perishables.~|~translationMissing
Well, I have this one which I can use to club people.~|~translationMissing
Are you going to hand it over or do you want to continue to waft it about menacingly?~|~translationMissing
I prefer to keep this fine weapon with which to smite mine enemies.~|~translationMissing
You would be more menacing if your weapon weren't quite so rotten.~|~translationMissing
On second thought, the way you wave it about makes me fear for my life. Stow it in your back and talk to me again.~|~translationMissing
Here's one.~|~translationMissing
Thanks! This is great for me, although I'll need another one if you want any sort of reward.~|~translationMissing
Why do you come back with no chickens? I'll be needing another one before I give you your reward! I'm not going to relent, even if you say 'plz plz plz' and claim you were just scammed.~|~translationMissing
Here's the second one for my reward.~|~translationMissing
Continues with Ava's Amazing! Success! dialogue~|~translationMissing
Go and talk to the Witch next door. She'd talk the hid legs off a donkey but she can select the iron with which is suitable for the chicken to interact.~|~translationMissing
Despite my extensive studies, her years of experience make her better at instinctive magico-mystical interaction. Oh well, at least I'm cleverer, prettier and will have a better bed.~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, you're great. Yes, I'll go and talk to her when you've finished praising yourself.~|~translationMissing
Witch~|~translationMissing
Hello, hello, my poppet. What brings you to my little room?~|~translationMissing
Ava told me to ask you about making magnets. Something about natural fields and other stuff. Sounded like she needed a farmer, to be honest.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, deary, I can tell you just what to do and you won't have to worry your pretty head about the complicated bits.~|~translationMissing
No need to patronise me quite so much, you know.~|~translationMissing
Just bring me 5 iron bars, though, and you're well on the way to never having to talk to me again.~|~translationMissing
I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
I am back.~|~translationMissing
Oh, but sugarpie, I need 5 iron bars, you don't have any. Come back to me quickly with all 5 of them.~|~translationMissing
I have some iron bars here.~|~translationMissing
Oh, but sugarpie, I need 5 iron bars, you don't have enough. Come back to me quickly with all 5 of them.~|~translationMissing
I've talked to the Witch and she has asked me for some iron bars.~|~translationMissing
Do I resemble an iron-bar merchant?~|~translationMissing
Great, you'll go far! I made some nice painted metal toys for you, snookums.~|~translationMissing
Toys? Snookums? What are you on about, you deranged old bat?~|~translationMissing
Oh, forget it, then. If you won't react to kindness, I'm back to luring infants into my oven. You'll have it on your conscience.~|~translationMissing
Go to the iron mine just north-east of Rimmington and hit the bar with a plain old smithing hammer while facing north. Then take your new magnet to Ava. Poor girl, having to deal with whippersnappers like you.~|~translationMissing
You were sent to try my patience, weren't you? Go away and make that magnet, then hand it to Ava.~|~translationMissing
I've talked to the Witch and now I've given her some iron bars.~|~translationMissing
I'm thrilled for you. What about my magnet?~|~translationMissing
The process is subject to some unexpected delays.~|~translationMissing
I can see now why Fenkenstain prefers to work with dead folk. It can't be more frustrating than working with you.~|~translationMissing
You aren't in the the right area for this to work.~|~translationMissing
You think that facing North might work better.~|~translationMissing
You hammer the iron bar and create a magnet.~|~translationMissing
Hoorah for you, you have the magnet. Just hand it over to Ava. I'm working on my new recipe for spit-roast adventurer, so disturbing me isn't wise.~|~translationMissing
Great stuff! With the Witch's influence within the magnet, the undead chicken can use this, I'm sure.~|~translationMissing
The plan is that the chicken will operate the magnet to attract bits of iron and steel, maybe even your own recently fired arrows. There are plenty of totally lost arrowheads lying about in the fields of Gielinor, I bet.~|~translationMissing
In addition, arrows which you fire should be able to be attracted back to your quiver by the cunning avian.~|~translationMissing
We need a source of wood, but one which is spiritually active and can regenerate itself. That will save you some axework in the future.~|~translationMissing
Try using a woodcutting axe on the pesky trees in the garden here, the ones that attack rather than the really dead ones. They are probably just the sort of thing we could use.~|~translationMissing
They will try to kill me, though, and I can't fight back!~|~translationMissing
Now you know how those poor guards feel when you hide behind mushrooms and fences and attack them from afar! Anyway, I reckon you'll need to try a mithril or better axe on the trees. At least the trees are~|~translationMissing
pretty close.~|~translationMissing
Your work with the magnet increases your Crafting experience slightly.~|~translationMissing
So, what terrible hitch have you encountered now?~|~translationMissing
Well, I've heard that all kinds of dragons and even basilisks can drop mithril axes, if that's why you are delaying. Most of these creatures are silly enough that you can even hide behind something and plink them to~|~translationMissing
death in the brave ranger way.~|~translationMissing
You don't have an axe which could possibly affect this wood.~|~translationMissing
The axe bounces off the undead wood. You should report this to Ava.~|~translationMissing
Well, I tried to hack the trees with my axe, but it just bounced off the trunk! It did all seem all-too-convenient to work on the first try.~|~translationMissing
Fortunately for you, I've done some research and it seems to suggest that there are two choices open to you.~|~translationMissing
Tell me the worst.~|~translationMissing
The first is more interesting. We cut off your arms, have them reanimated as undead, reattach them and then you should be able to cut the trees normally.~|~translationMissing
Of course, you won't be able to pick your nose anymore, so I suppose you'll want to try the second option.~|~translationMissing
I'm not exactly addicted to picking my nose, but I do think I'll pass on that method.~|~translationMissing
Well, in that case, I think it may have something to do with Slayer abilities. After all, I did see Turael poking around the trees while I was moving in.~|~translationMissing
As he's not known for his random touristic activities, you should try chatting with this Turael. He's the Slayer Master near Burthorpe.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I hope he doesn't want me to buy one of his ridiculous fashion accessories. Those earmuffs he sells make heroic adventurers into a laughing stock.~|~translationMissing
Turael~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I need another assignment.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you any rewards for me, or anything to trade?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Let's talk about the difficulty of my assignments.~|~translationMissing
I'm here about a quest. Ava said she saw you hanging around the moving trees near Draynor Manor.~|~translationMissing
I think I need some of the wood from them, but my axe just bounced off the trunk.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like you need a blessed axe. No one really makes them, though, these days.~|~translationMissing
Blessed axes are too soft to cut normal wood since the axe's edge must be replaced by holy silver. I can do you a favour, though.~|~translationMissing
If you can give me a mithril axe and a holy symbol of Saradomin I can let you have my axe. I'll make myself a new one when no one is pestering me for Slayer tasks.~|~translationMissing
Okay, so I'll see whether I can spare an axe and a symbol. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Er... Nothing...~|~translationMissing
Hello, I'm here about those trees again.~|~translationMissing
I can make an axe for you now, if you wish. Remember, it will be no use for normal woodcutting after I have added the silver edge.~|~translationMissing
I'd love one, thanks.~|~translationMissing
If the player has both holy symbol and mithril axe~|~translationMissing
If the player only has a mithril axe~|~translationMissing
You'll need to hand over both a mithril axe and holy symbol of Saradomin. You don't have a symbol in your pack, so I'm not able to help.~|~translationMissing
If the player only has a holy symbol~|~translationMissing
You'll need to hand over both a mithril axe and holy symbol of Saradomin. You don't have an axe in your pack, so I'm not able to help.~|~translationMissing
If the player has neither axe nor holy symbol~|~translationMissing
Goodbye then. You may, of course, return if you decide you want a new axe.~|~translationMissing
Turael, the Slayer Master, told me what to do - with no earmuffs, spiky helmets or other laughable headgear involved.~|~translationMissing
You scare me sometimes.~|~translationMissing
I think I'm ready to cut those trees now.~|~translationMissing
You almoust remove a suitable twig, but you don't quite manage it.~|~translationMissing
You cut some undead twigs.~|~translationMissing
I have that undead wood at last. Well, twigs anyway.~|~translationMissing
You certainly took your time.~|~translationMissing
I'd say they didn't grow on trees, but I guess you'd just be sarcastic about my sense of humour.~|~translationMissing
Quite. Now that we have all the ingredients for infinite arrows, we just need a container in which we can keep the components in the correct mutual alignment.~|~translationMissing
I've gathered together some research notes from various sources but I can't quite make out what they mean. If you want to have a go at making them out, just ask me for a copy.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to look at those research notes now, unless you have translated them without me?~|~translationMissing
I'd find it slightly inconvenient, I'm sure.~|~translationMissing
It wouldn't be all bad as your body would be useful for research after death. What I'd be upset about was if bits of you landed in my nice new bed.~|~translationMissing
Your concern is touching.~|~translationMissing
I seem to have lost the research notes.~|~translationMissing
I have the notes but haven't translated them yet. Any hints?~|~translationMissing
So, take the hint and go off and translate them. If it's too hard, you can always go and shoot demons in cages.~|~translationMissing
It suddenly all makes sense.~|~translationMissing
I've translated those notes. See? I'm not just a thuggish moron like you seem to think.~|~translationMissing
For all I know, it was pure luck, so don't jump to any conclusions about your mighty intellect.~|~translationMissing
If you are having trouble finding buttons, I've heard rumours that the H.A.M. society carry this sort of stuff more than most.~|~translationMissing
Really? How would you know this strange detail?~|~translationMissing
I hear they lose their clothes a lot to thieves so they have to make do with shoddy goods. Whatever the reason, they seem to carry buttons about in their pockets.~|~translationMissing
So what do I do with this pattern again?~|~translationMissing
Your short-term memory loss worries me.  Combine the pattern with hard leather and some polished buttons, then hand the resulting container to me.~|~translationMissing
The pattern seems to have vanished from my pack... not my fault, of course.~|~translationMissing
You're pretty careless, aren't you? I assume you're the type who leaves a trail of arrows and knives behind them when they train?~|~translationMissing
You need a pattern as well as these 2 items.~|~translationMissing
You need hard leather as well as these 2 items.~|~translationMissing
You need polished buttons as well as these 2 items.~|~translationMissing
You've made the container, I assume?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, although I seem to have mislaid it.~|~translationMissing
It's only the final, vital step in your quest that you decided to leave who-knows-where. Don't worry, I have plenty of spares.~|~translationMissing
Why do I sense sarcasm somewhere here?~|~translationMissing
Wow, great, now the arrow manufacturer is ready for use...there you are! Talk to me if you need more information later.~|~translationMissing
If the player has level 50 Ranged~|~translationMissing
You are also skilled enough that I'm rewarding you with the upgraded version right away. Congratulations.~|~translationMissing

Ambassador Alvijar~|~translationMissing
Headman Ur-tag, I cannot stress enough how important it is that this train link be completed on time. The mining companies have taken out considerable loans...~|~translationMissing
Ur-tag~|~translationMissing
I understand your concerns, Ambassador, but you must realise that the discoveries must change the whole schedule. To remove them too hurriedly would be a crime against knowledge.~|~translationMissing
What are you arguing about?~|~translationMissing
What are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
It's the new underground train link being built between our city and the dwarven city of Keldagrim.~|~translationMissing
It will be the pinnacle of dwarven engineering! A great leap forward from the old steam-powered minecarts! A monument to the power and ingenuity of the Consortium!~|~translationMissing
And it would be finished by now, except that they found some old goblin bones they want to dig up.~|~translationMissing
We've unearthed some very important artefacts that were buried during the Dorgeshuun Civil War. They could shed important light on our history.~|~translationMissing
[player name], do you have any experience with archaeology?~|~translationMissing
I passed my archaeology exam at the Digsite!~|~translationMissing
Excellent! We have not had a major archaeological project for generations, so if you could give us some help we would appreciate it.~|~translationMissing
Start the Another Slice of H.A.M. quest?~|~translationMissing
I'd love to help!~|~translationMissing
Splendid! The path to the train tunnel is in the south- west of the city.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps now we can get this finished quickly and get on with laying the tracks.~|~translationMissing
Do your own digging!~|~translationMissing
Oh well. We will continue at our own pace.~|~translationMissing
What can I do in the city?~|~translationMissing
Why don't you visit the market? I hear there is quite a craze for surface foods at the moment, so you might be able to sell something there.~|~translationMissing
You might also want to visit the caves to the south of the city. There are many monsters to fight there, and Zanik apparently found ways to cross over their heads!~|~translationMissing
Why did you decide to open the city?~|~translationMissing
For trade, and for fostering goodwill between races! I am sure that it will benefit both our races.~|~translationMissing
How is the archaeological dig going?~|~translationMissing
It's not finished yet.~|~translationMissing
I wish you could work more quickly. The new train link is very important to the dwarven economy.~|~translationMissing
I hope you're hurrying up with that archaeological dig. Every moment we wait wastes more of the Consortium's money!~|~translationMissing
Zanik~|~translationMissing
Hi [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Hi Zanik. What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
I'm having a look at the things that are being dug up here!~|~translationMissing
It's really amazing to think that these things were used by my ancestors hundreds of years ago. Tegdak thinks that some of them may even have been brought down here from the surface by the early Dorgeshuun!~|~translationMissing
Builder~|~translationMissing
I hope those goblins hurry up with their digging. It's so frustrating having to stop work when the train link is nearly finished!~|~translationMissing
Bah! These goblins don't appreciate how important this train link is! It'll be the greatest dwarven achievement of this generation, and it's being held up just so they can pick at old broken things in the ground.~|~translationMissing
I hope the Consortium will understand it's not our fault the work will be finished late. This is the most important job of my career!~|~translationMissing
I'm looking forward to riding on this train once it's finished. It'll be so much faster than the old steam- powered minecarts. It'll be the fastest machine in Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
Will you tell those goblins to get on with their digging? We've got a job to finish here.~|~translationMissing
Tegdak~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello surface-dweller. I'm afraid we're a bit busy cleaning specimens at the moment so I can't help you.~|~translationMissing
Ur-tag asked me to help out with the dig. I have an archaeology qualification!~|~translationMissing
Oh! In that case we could use your help.~|~translationMissing
There are some ancient goblin artefacts buried in the ground around here. We want to extract them, but we don't have much experience and could end up breaking them.~|~translationMissing
Could you extract them, clean them, and then give them to me please?~|~translationMissing
Okay.~|~translationMissing
Here, take this trowel and specimen brush.~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on with extracting the artefacts?~|~translationMissing
I haven't got any yet.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a trowel~|~translationMissing
Also, I lost my trowel.~|~translationMissing
If there is no inventory space~|~translationMissing
Well, you'll have to free up some inventory space before I can give you a new one.~|~translationMissing
(Continues below)~|~translationMissing
If there is inventory space~|~translationMissing
Never mind. Have another one.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a specimen brush~|~translationMissing
And I lost my specimen brush.~|~translationMissing
Well you'll have to free up some inventory space before I can give you a new one.~|~translationMissing
You extract the artefact.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for extracting that artefact, but you'll need to clean it as well.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a specimen brush~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have inventory space~|~translationMissing
I've got a sample brush here but you'll have to make space in your inventory for me to give it to you.~|~translationMissing
Here, use this brush to clean the artefact.~|~translationMissing
You clean the find with your brush.~|~translationMissing
You drop the artefact and it rolls back to its original place in the ground.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
If the artefact is an armour shard~|~translationMissing
It looks like a fragment of armour.~|~translationMissing
Look at the design! That's a lot like the design of the goblin armour I saw on the surface.~|~translationMissing
That confirms that our ancestors retained a lot of customs from the surface even after they came down here. Our guards didn't start wearing lighter chainmail until after the Civil War.~|~translationMissing
If that was the sixth artefact handed in~|~translationMissing
That's all the artefacts we needed to extract. Thanks again, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Now, the most interesting one is this ancient mace. It's the only intact weapon, and I'm pretty sure it dates back to the time when the Dorgeshuun were on the surface.~|~translationMissing
It's covered in symbols, but I can't decipher them. Zanik, could you take it to the scribe? He might know what they mean. I'll finish up the dig here.~|~translationMissing
Sure thing! Come on, [player name], let's go talk to the scribe~|~translationMissing
Zanik starts following the player.~|~translationMissing
If the player has another cleaned artefact~|~translationMissing
I have another one.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have another cleaned artefact~|~translationMissing
If the artefact is a shield fragment~|~translationMissing
It looks like a piece of a shield.~|~translationMissing
Look at that stress fracture. It looks like this shield broke pretty easily.~|~translationMissing
I would guess that this shield was made during the Dorgeshuun Civil War and not handed down from the time on the surface.~|~translationMissing
It seems that even by the time of the Civil War, our ancestors were beginning to lose their skills at making weapons.~|~translationMissing
If the artefact is a helmet fragment~|~translationMissing
It looks like a piece of a helmet.~|~translationMissing
A helmet? So those are eye-holes? They look too small.~|~translationMissing
This was from the early days of Dorgesh-Kaan. It must have been before our ancestors' eyes reached their current size.~|~translationMissing
If the artefact is a sword fragment~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. What do you think?~|~translationMissing
It looks a bit like a sword, doesn't it? I saw some people using them on the surface.~|~translationMissing
The early Dorgeshuun must have used a much larger variety of weapons than we do now.~|~translationMissing
If the artefact is an axe head~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. It's got some kind of blade... Is it a spear tip?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I know what it is! It's an axe head!~|~translationMissing
Axes are these things they use on the surface for cutting down trees. I think they can be used as weapons too.~|~translationMissing
Our ancestors must have brought it down from the surface, then. There would be no need for them to make axes when they were down here, as there are no trees.~|~translationMissing
It's amazing to think that we're handling objects that date back to the time of the war of the gods!~|~translationMissing
If the artefact is a mace~|~translationMissing
It's... Actually, what is it? It's a sort of stick with a lump on the end.~|~translationMissing
I think it's a mace.~|~translationMissing
A mace?~|~translationMissing
A kind of weapon.~|~translationMissing
I haven't got any more yet.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help. There's not much left for us to do here except pack everything up. Have you shown that mace to the scribe yet?~|~translationMissing
I've got a strange feeling about this mace, [player name]. Maybe when we find out about it, it will shed some light onto my destiny. Come on, let's show it to the scribe.~|~translationMissing
Okay~|~translationMissing
I need to do something else for a bit~|~translationMissing
I need to do something else for a bit.~|~translationMissing
All right. I'll go back and help finish the dig.~|~translationMissing
Zanik returns to the railway~|~translationMissing
Shall we go and talk to the scribe about this ancient mace now?~|~translationMissing
Let's go then!~|~translationMissing
Oh well. Let me know when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Where is the mace?~|~translationMissing
I've got it! I'll hold onto it until we've shown it to the scribe. Shall we go?~|~translationMissing
Thank you for helping with the dig! Ur-tag tells me it will be finished soon, and then we will be able to resume work!~|~translationMissing
Greetings, surface-dweller. Welcome to Dorgesh-Kaan.~|~translationMissing
Oldak~|~translationMissing
Ah, Zanik. Would you like to see the results of my experiment with nature runes?~|~translationMissing
Not right now, Oldak. I'm helping [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Goblin scribe~|~translationMissing
Ah, hello Zanik, hello [player name]. How is the dig going?~|~translationMissing
[player name] helped us to finish the dig! Look what she dug up!~|~translationMissing
Zanik shows the mace to the scribe.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... that is interesting. What do you think it is?~|~translationMissing
It's a mace.~|~translationMissing
[player name] says that's a kind of weapon.~|~translationMissing
I can see how. I certainly wouldn't want to be hit with it!~|~translationMissing
We think it's a magical weapon from the surface. Can you decipher the symbols on it?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm afraid not. Our written language has developed so much since then that it's totally indecipherable to me.~|~translationMissing
Oh well.~|~translationMissing
Wait a moment. [player name], didn't you say you talked to some surface goblins when you were trying to find your way through our mines?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I talked to the generals in the Goblin Village.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you could talk to them again. They might know more about weapons than we do.~|~translationMissing
Good idea!~|~translationMissing
I'd rather not travel all that way over the surface, though. I wonder if Oldak could use magic to help us get there?~|~translationMissing
Hello, Zanik. Have you found out about that mace yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. Come on, [player name]! We should go and ask the goblin generals about it!~|~translationMissing
I can't believe we're going to the Goblin Village on the surface! I'm finally going to see how my distant relatives live!~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm a little nervous about what I'll find there...~|~translationMissing
Shall we go see Oldak now? I'm sure he'll have a way of getting us to the Goblin Village quickly!~|~translationMissing
Yes! Now we're going to go to the Goblin Village to ask the surface goblins about it!~|~translationMissing
Good idea! Maybe Oldak can help you get there.~|~translationMissing
Not right now, Oldak. We wanted to see if you could make Moving-Over-Distance Spheres to somewhere other than the city.~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes. My research along those lines has been coming along very well. I think I could make a Moving-Over- Distance Sphere to anywhere you like, given a little work.~|~translationMissing
We're trying to take this ancient goblin mace to the Goblin Village on the surface. Do you think you could help us to get there?~|~translationMissing
Hmm. The Goblin Village, you say? Yes, I think I could do that. Just a moment.~|~translationMissing
Oldak carefully measures out some crushed runes and makes a glass sphere around them.~|~translationMissing
There you go. I've made you each one to get you to the Goblin Village and one to bring you back here.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Oldak! Okay, [player name], let's go!~|~translationMissing
The player and Zanik both break the glass spheres on the ground and begin to teleport. Start of cutscene in Goblin Village as it fades to black~|~translationMissing
Ow, my eyes...~|~translationMissing
So this is the Goblin Village! It's so different from Dorgesh-Kaan, isn't it, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
[player name], where are you?~|~translationMissing
[player name]?~|~translationMissing
The player finally teleports to Goblin Village~|~translationMissing
Aaaah!~|~translationMissing
Sorry about that, [player name]! Oldak's calculations aren't always exact!~|~translationMissing
So this is how goblins on the surface live! Come on, [player name], lets talk to them!~|~translationMissing
Come on [player name], let's get back to the Goblin Village on the surface! Shall we go?~|~translationMissing
Ah, Zanik. How did you get on at the Goblin Village?~|~translationMissing
We haven't finished there actually. Do you think you could teleport us there again?~|~translationMissing
The player and Zanik both break the glass spheres on the ground and begin to teleport.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene of the generals meeting with Zanik and the player with Grubfoot in the background~|~translationMissing
General Wartface~|~translationMissing
Who you?~|~translationMissing
I'm Zanik of the Dorgeshuun!~|~translationMissing
Lost tribe?~|~translationMissing
That's right! We've been cut off from the outside world for thousands of years but now we're back!~|~translationMissing
General Bentnoze~|~translationMissing
So legend true!~|~translationMissing
What you want?~|~translationMissing
Can you tell us anything about this mace?~|~translationMissing
That holy mace of Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
In time of great war, strongest goblin warriors carry maces like this.~|~translationMissing
They use them to take favour of gods away from enemy. If another god protecting enemy, goblin warrior use this mace and favour of god is stolen away!~|~translationMissing
Oh. A holy mace of the War God.~|~translationMissing
You not look very happy.~|~translationMissing
You should praise Big High War God for giving you holy mace!~|~translationMissing
The Dorgeshuun don't have quite the same attitude to the gods as you on the surface do.~|~translationMissing
All goblins worship Big High War God! Without him we nothing!~|~translationMissing
You not real goblin! You filthy human!~|~translationMissing
I am a goblin!~|~translationMissing
You not even look like goblin! You have big eyes and wrong colour skin!~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot~|~translationMissing
She is goblin!~|~translationMissing
Shut up Grubfoot!~|~translationMissing
No let him speak.~|~translationMissing
She is goblin. And she more than that...~|~translationMissing
Last night I have dream. I see this new goblin come into village, holding up holy mace.~|~translationMissing
All goblins gather around her. Not just from village, from all over world. She is Chosen Commander!~|~translationMissing
Chosen Commander?~|~translationMissing
That story from goblin holy book. We not had Commander of all goblins since time of great war.~|~translationMissing
Holy book say someday Big High War God send Chosen Commander to lead us to victory over whole world.~|~translationMissing
That what I see in dream. It her destiny.~|~translationMissing
My destiny...~|~translationMissing
That not true! She cannot be Chosen Commander! She not proper goblin! She not worship Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
But what if she is? If we ignore her, Big High War God strike us down!~|~translationMissing
All right. I not believe you Chosen Commander. But we let you talk to people in village.~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot! Tell people in village to gather around! Dorgesh goblin will speak to us all!~|~translationMissing
Fade out to the generals addressing the goblins of Goblin Village~|~translationMissing
Goblins listen up! This Zanik, she from Dorgeshuun tribe!~|~translationMissing
She say she Chosen Commander!~|~translationMissing
No, I-~|~translationMissing
We not know what she have to say. But in case she Chosen Commander, we let her speak. Speak, Zanik!~|~translationMissing
Help, [player name]! What should I say?~|~translationMissing
I don't know!~|~translationMissing
Goblins... goblins of the Goblin Village. I'm Zanik of the Dorgeshuun. You may know the legend of the Dorgeshuun, but let me tell you our own version.~|~translationMissing
Thousands of years ago, the Big High War God forced all goblins to fight in a terrible war.~|~translationMissing
Goblins~|~translationMissing
Big High War God! Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
No! Listen! The god commanded the Dorgeshuun to fight a battle they could not win!~|~translationMissing
Goblin~|~translationMissing
You weak! You hide instead of fight!~|~translationMissing
You don't need to think in those terms! We've lived for centuries without war, and without gods, and-~|~translationMissing
A goblin gets hit with a magical fire attack, scorching them to death.~|~translationMissing
Aaaargh!~|~translationMissing
Another goblin gets hit with a arrow and dies.~|~translationMissing
Unk!~|~translationMissing
We under attack!~|~translationMissing
Scatter!~|~translationMissing
The goblins scatter into buildings.~|~translationMissing
All the goblins are gone. Zanik and the player are hidden behind different buildings.~|~translationMissing
The shots came from the top of that tower, [player name]! Can you see anything?~|~translationMissing
There are two snipers up there.~|~translationMissing
I can't get anywhere without coming into their line of fire, but I think you could get around the side of the buildings to the ladder.~|~translationMissing
end of cutscene~|~translationMissing
An arrow thuds into the ground and forces you to jump back.~|~translationMissing
Sigmund attacks Zanik in the centre of Goblin Village~|~translationMissing
Sigmund!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund~|~translationMissing
You can never defeat me! I've been training my Combat by killing goblins around Lumbridge!~|~translationMissing
You... you murderer!~|~translationMissing
Quick, [player name]! Shoot him while I have him distracted!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund throws a flashbang on the ground and bright white light flashes~|~translationMissing
Aaaaah! My eyes!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund now has Zanik in front of him facing the player with his sword at her throat.~|~translationMissing
Don't even think about it, [player name]! Make one move and I'll slit her throat!~|~translationMissing
Your little goblin friend has a role in my plan! I'm taking her to the tunnel we've built from the Lumbridge Swamp Caves to the new dwarven train track.~|~translationMissing
When the cave goblins find that the dwarven train has killed their hero, there will be war between them! Saradomin's chosen children can watch as two vile underground races wipe each another out!~|~translationMissing
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-haaa!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund turns and backs out of the village with Zanik~|~translationMissing
Are they gone?~|~translationMissing
What happen?~|~translationMissing
Sigmund has kidnapped Zanik!~|~translationMissing
He kidnap Chosen Commander? You must rescue her!~|~translationMissing
Human will need help. You take our best warrior, Sergeant Mossfists.~|~translationMissing
No! Sergeant Slimetoes best warrior! Take him!~|~translationMissing
We don't have time for this! Why don't I take both warriors?~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot! Fetch Mossfists and Slimetoes and tell them to meet [player name] in Lumbridge Swamp!~|~translationMissing
You take ancient goblin mace. Maybe it be useful.~|~translationMissing
You rescue Chosen Commander and she lead us all to glory!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I've heard that one of your number has got hold of part of a map.~|~translationMissing
How can I rescue Zanik?~|~translationMissing
Pink robe man say they digging tunnel under Lumbridge Swamp Caves. You go there to rescue Chosen Commander.~|~translationMissing
Sergeants wait for you at entrance to Lumbridge Swamp Caves.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) So how is life for the goblins?~|~translationMissing
Thank you for helping with the dig! I hear that the work on the tunnel is now complete and the first train will be making the journey very soon!~|~translationMissing
You've got to stop the train! Sigmund is planning something terrible down there!~|~translationMissing
What are you babbling about? Everyone was cleared out of the tunnel when we completed work. There's no reason to stop the train.~|~translationMissing
Sergeant Slimetoes~|~translationMissing
You [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Sergeant Mossfists~|~translationMissing
Generals say we help you rescue Chosen Commander.~|~translationMissing
It too important for puny human to do on own. You just get killed.~|~translationMissing
So we come to look after you so you not die.~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot say pink robe man take Chosen Commander down this hole into new tunnel.~|~translationMissing
We distract guards for you. If we see them, we attack them so you get past while we fighting!~|~translationMissing
What we waiting for? We must go down into tunnel and rescue Chosen Commander!~|~translationMissing
Look, there new hole with ladder just next to climby-out rope. We go down there.~|~translationMissing
Shoulder view from the guard to the player and goblin sergeants~|~translationMissing
Oh no! Goblins!~|~translationMissing
Fade out as the guard runs off~|~translationMissing
Ha ha! Puny human scared of me!~|~translationMissing
No he scared of me!~|~translationMissing
He's probably just gone to get reinforcements. He'll be back in a few moments with more guards.~|~translationMissing
Both of you follow me~|~translationMissing
Both of you follow me.~|~translationMissing
One of you wait here~|~translationMissing
One of you wait here.~|~translationMissing
Both of you wait here~|~translationMissing
Both of you wait here.~|~translationMissing
Goblin!~|~translationMissing
Kill it!~|~translationMissing
Quick! Me keep human busy!~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
Take that!~|~translationMissing
You there!~|~translationMissing
Intruder!~|~translationMissing
You go quick! I keep guard busy!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund has Zanik tied to the train tracks.~|~translationMissing
At last I have defeated you, you filthy goblin!~|~translationMissing
Any moment now the first dwarf train will come thundering down this tunnel and crush you! And then the goblins and the dwarves will go to war!~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
You monster!~|~translationMissing
No, YOU'RE the monster! That's why you and all your filthy species must die!~|~translationMissing
We meet again, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
This time your goblin friend cannot help you. You are on your own and have no way to overcome my prayers!~|~translationMissing
Help! Help!~|~translationMissing
The cutscene ends and the fight starts~|~translationMissing
Saradomin protect me from melee!~|~translationMissing
Saradomin protect me from missiles!~|~translationMissing
Saradomin protect me from magic~|~translationMissing
What's happening? That weapon is overcoming Saradomin's protection! You've taken away the last of my prayer energy!~|~translationMissing
Bah! You win again, [player name]! But someday, somehow, I will have my revenge!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund fades away~|~translationMissing
Quick, [player name]! Untie me before the train comes!~|~translationMissing
The player unties Zanik from the railway and they both jump out of the way as the train goes by~|~translationMissing
Back at the train junction...~|~translationMissing
~ The grand opening of the Dorgesh-Kaan - Keldagrim train line ~~|~translationMissing
Dwarves and goblins are cheering in the crowd faving Ur-tag, Zanik, and the player~|~translationMissing
It gives me great pleasure to declare this new train link open!~|~translationMissing
[player name], Zanik has told me about your exploits. It seems that all the Dorgeshuun owe you our lives once again.~|~translationMissing
All in a day's work for an adventurer like me!~|~translationMissing
As a reward, I suggest you keep the ancient goblin mace that you helped to excavate.~|~translationMissing
Most of the Dorgeshuun would be happy if such a war- like artefact was kept outside the city, and I am sure you will keep it in safe hands.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Ur-tag!~|~translationMissing

2 Talking to Aretha~|~translationMissing
3 Digging for the artefact~|~translationMissing
4 Talking to the Key Master~|~translationMissing
The book referred to an artefact being buried in Kourend, but the author did not specify where it was buried. Maybe you could persuade her to change her mind.~|~translationMissing
Aretha~|~translationMissing
Respect the souls, traveller.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Why are all these souls here?~|~translationMissing
I've been reading your book...~|~translationMissing
I've been reading your book~|~translationMissing
'The Journey of Souls'~|~translationMissing
Let me guess, traveller... did you come to ask me where the soul bearer was buried? Every mortal who reads my book seems to want to get their hands on it.~|~translationMissing
Mortals are so predictable. This is the kind of thinking that led that adventurer to break into the Guardian's cave and damage the soul bearer in the first place.~|~translationMissing
It occurs to me, though, that even if you dig it up, the artefact is damaged. Although the Elders of Arceuus never had the knowledge to repair it, there is one who may be able to help.~|~translationMissing
I speak of the Key Master, he who watches over the cave of the three-headed Guardian of the River. He has been there for countless years, and will have absorbed power from the River in that time.~|~translationMissing
Now, we buried the artefact in the crypt of the Arceuus church. As I have revealed this secret to you, you will no longer be affected by the spells that prevent unwary explorers from stumbling across it.~|~translationMissing
Thanks! I'll be off now.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't want your smelly soul bearer.~|~translationMissing
Hmmph! So what do you want? I trust you will respect the souls while you are in this hallowed place.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Okay, I'm respecting the souls.~|~translationMissing
You have found the soul bearer.~|~translationMissing
Aretha said you might be able to repair the soul bearer for me.~|~translationMissing
Key Master~|~translationMissing
The soul bearer! You have the soul bearer! The voices speak of it often. It is from this place, yet it is not of this place.~|~translationMissing
Will you repair it?~|~translationMissing
The voices tell me I can. They speak to me!~|~translationMissing
The Key Master repairs your soul bearer.~|~translationMissing
The voices say you must use it wisely.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What voices?~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I will.~|~translationMissing

Hello there. What are you doing all the way out here?~|~translationMissing
Willow~|~translationMissing
Just... looking around.~|~translationMissing
Oh, did you lose something?~|~translationMissing
No... I found something. A door.~|~translationMissing
A door? I see doors all the time. What makes this one so special?~|~translationMissing
It's buried beneath a tonne of rocks. Could be the entrance to some ancient ruins...~|~translationMissing
Wow! Ancient ruins? Are you an archaeologist or something?~|~translationMissing
Archaeologist? Me? Hmm...~|~translationMissing
Of course I am! I'm the greatest archaeologist of our time. The name's Willow! Have you not heard of me?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I haven't. Are you looking for a way into the ruins?~|~translationMissing
You bet I am, but I don't think there's any other way in.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. Do you have another plan to get in?~|~translationMissing
Potentially, but I won't be able to do it on my own. Nor can I leave the area. If I'm not here to guard the entrance, some other archaeologist might come along and steal the glory from me!~|~translationMissing
Maybe you could give me a hand? There could be untold riches inside the ruins!~|~translationMissing
A chance to uncover ancient ruins doesn't happen every day! Of course I'll help! I'm [player name] by the way. How do you plan to get in?~|~translationMissing
The entrance is covered in rocks and rubble - I don't think mining them will work.~|~translationMissing
We'll need something stronger. Who knows what could be inside the ruins. There could be traps, or even monsters!~|~translationMissing
No, I think we'll need to get my old crew...~|~translationMissing
...I mean, excavation team together. But you'll need to convince them to help us. We didn't part on the best of terms.~|~translationMissing
We had a falling out after a, uhm... dig, went wrong.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find your old team, and how will they help?~|~translationMissing
To get into the ruins we'll need to blow up all the rocks blocking the entrance.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound too safe. What if we damage the ruins? Surely it's better to go slower and preserve as much as we can?~|~translationMissing
No! We need to get in there as soon as possible! Burntof the dwarf will do it. He's a master with explosives.~|~translationMissing
From what I can remember, he's a fan of his drink. His favourite pub being the Rising Sun Inn, in Falador - I'd look there first.~|~translationMissing
After we've blown the rocks away, we'll need someone to move all the rubble. Someone strong.~|~translationMissing
I could do it! I'm quite strong myself.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha! I don't think so. We need a real [strongman/strongwoman] - someone with muscles. An old friend of mine, Checkal, should be able to do all the heavy lifting.~|~translationMissing
Oh okay... Where can I find him?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... We had quite a rough falling out when we last spoke, but I heard he's hanging around Barbarian Village.~|~translationMissing
Lastly, if my hunch is correct, this place will be covered in traps. We'll need my pal Marley to disarm them. He's the best thief I know. Been doing it for years.~|~translationMissing
I have no idea where he is these days. But his cousin Charlie in Varrock may know. You should talk to him. He's normally somewhere near the Blue Moon Inn.~|~translationMissing
You have a rather interesting group of friends... but if they get us into the ruins, I'm all for it.~|~translationMissing
Good luck. Once you've recruited one of the team, I'll meet them at the entrance. It's on the west side of the mountain.~|~translationMissing
Seems like you're in a bit of a pickle. Have fun with that.~|~translationMissing
Back again? What can I help you with?~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Marley?~|~translationMissing
Marley is an elusive one, to be honest. I have no idea where to find him. You should try talk to his cousin Charlie near the Blue Moon Inn in Varrock. Maybe he will know.~|~translationMissing
Need help finding anyone else?~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Checkal?~|~translationMissing
Last I heard Checkal was hanging around Barbarian Village. Maybe you should head there to find him?~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Burntof?~|~translationMissing
Burntof likes to hang out at the Rising Sun Inn located in Falador.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find the entrance to the ruins?~|~translationMissing
On the western side of Ice Mountain. There's no way up on this side so you'll need to head east of here first and go around the dwarf colony to get there.~|~translationMissing
Nothing, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hurry up! It's not exactly exciting standing out here all day.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I'm [player name] and I'm looking for a man named Checkal.~|~translationMissing
Checkal~|~translationMissing
That would be me [sir/miss]. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I was told to come find you. Willow has found a new digsi...~|~translationMissing
Stop right there [sir/miss]. You can tell Willow she can do the heavy lifting herself.~|~translationMissing
And why is that?~|~translationMissing
Willow does not appreciate the amount of work that goes into building my physique. I would not help her lift a shrimp.~|~translationMissing
I take great pride in these muscles and it hurts me to the core to hear such insults!~|~translationMissing
But we need your help! She's found a new archaeological digsite and needs you to help clear the entrance.~|~translationMissing
Archaeological digsite? Why is Willow interested in starting a digsite?~|~translationMissing
She said there could be some ancient ruins, even an untouched hoard of gold and treasure!~|~translationMissing
Ah that makes sense. *Sighs* You poor [lad/lass]...~|~translationMissing
Nothing. Look, I will help you. But first you must prove your strength to me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 99 Strength~|~translationMissing
Well Checkal, I don't mean to brag, but there are few people in Gielinor stronger than me.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I will see about that.~|~translationMissing
Yes... you do have tremendous muscle mass.~|~translationMissing
Your legs are strong as steel, too.~|~translationMissing
Well [player name], I have to say you are the definition of strength.~|~translationMissing
I do try.~|~translationMissing
But a [strongman/strongwoman] doesn't stop when they reach the top. They always push themselves.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 99 Strength~|~translationMissing
Well that shouldn't be too hard. I'm pretty strong.~|~translationMissing
That is true. But are you strong in both body and mind?~|~translationMissing
Uhm... yes?~|~translationMissing
To be a true [strongman/strongwoman], you do not just need big muscles. No, you must have self control and an unrelenting desire to push yourself to become stronger.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm not sure about that...~|~translationMissing
I would ask you to train with my old friend and trainer, Atlas, one of the strongest barbarians I know. You can find him in the hall north of here.~|~translationMissing
If you can survive his rigorous training program, I shall offer you my help.~|~translationMissing
How do you know he'll train me?~|~translationMissing
Tell him I sent you and he will train you.~|~translationMissing
Alright then, I'll go speak to Atlas. Farewell.~|~translationMissing
I seem to have forgotten where Atlas is. Can you remind me?~|~translationMissing
Atlas can be found in the hall to the north of us.~|~translationMissing
No problem at all.~|~translationMissing
Atlas~|~translationMissing
What do you want, little [man/woman]?~|~translationMissing
I've just come to talk to you. Checkal said you could train me. He said you're the strongest barbarian he knows.~|~translationMissing
Oh did he now? What makes you think I will train you?~|~translationMissing
I... Um...~|~translationMissing
Come on then! Out with it already!~|~translationMissing
Well uh, he said he wouldn't...~|~translationMissing
I'm just pulling your leg! Any friend of Checkal is a friend of mine.~|~translationMissing
Please don't scare me like that.~|~translationMissing
It's a force of habit. It comes with the barbarian lifestyle. But to apologise, I'll give you a free lesson!~|~translationMissing
Oh really? How much would this usually cost?~|~translationMissing
Around 25,000 coins per session.~|~translationMissing
That's a lot of money!~|~translationMissing
No price is too much for a good workout. Are you ready to start your training session?~|~translationMissing
Training session begins.~|~translationMissing
If you want to become a [strongman/strongwoman], you need to get into shape!~|~translationMissing
It's not all about strength! You need to get some cardio in, too.~|~translationMissing
You need to be tough to be a [strongman/strongwoman]! Show me what you've got! Come on!~|~translationMissing
Every [strongman/strongwoman] was once a beginner who refused to give up.~|~translationMissing
You need to push yourself!~|~translationMissing
Always strive to be the best that you can be! That is the [strongman/strongwoman] way.~|~translationMissing
I'm very proud of you. You've shown grit, determination and an iron will. You are a true [strongman/strongwoman] at heart.~|~translationMissing
That was exhausting... I've never worked so hard in my life!~|~translationMissing
And for that, I am proud. Now, show us what you're made of and flex those muscles!~|~translationMissing
You have unlocked the flex emote!~|~translationMissing
Training session ends.~|~translationMissing
My work is done. Return to Checkal and show him your new-found muscles.~|~translationMissing
Not right now, I am a bit busy.~|~translationMissing
No problem. Come back when you are ready.~|~translationMissing
You're back. Would you like to start that training session now?~|~translationMissing
Well done, little one. You've proven your worth.~|~translationMissing
Can I do it again?~|~translationMissing
What? Why?~|~translationMissing
It was fun, I'd like to do it again.~|~translationMissing
You're the first person to ask me that [player name]. I suppose I could train you again, but I will have to charge you the full 25,000 coins this time.~|~translationMissing
Let's do this, I'm ready.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 25000 coins on them~|~translationMissing
It's not going to be any easier my friend!~|~translationMissing
Training session restarts. See above for dialogue.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 25000 coins on them~|~translationMissing
Hold it there little one, you don't have enough money to pay for the lesson.~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry I was too excited...~|~translationMissing
No worries friend, come back when you can afford the session.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for that workout. I can see why you normally charge people so much.~|~translationMissing
Back again I see, here for another workout?~|~translationMissing
You must take your training very seriously [player name]. This is the second time you'll have done this workout and paid full price!~|~translationMissing
Pay Atlas 25,000 coins to train again?~|~translationMissing
You take your training very seriously [player name]. You know you've done this workout [times done] times, are you sure you want to do it again?~|~translationMissing
So have you completed your training session with Atlas?~|~translationMissing
Just about, but it was a real struggle.~|~translationMissing
It always is, but I can see you are standing taller and looking stronger already.~|~translationMissing
Now, show me your muscles and I will judge if you're ready to receive my help.~|~translationMissing
Show your strength by flexing your muscles.~|~translationMissing
My goodness, those muscles are exquisite. I will definitely help a [man/lady] who shows that much dedication to their physique.~|~translationMissing
Fantastic! Willow said she'd meet you by the entrance, on the west side of Ice Mountain.~|~translationMissing
Thank you my friend, I will meet you there.~|~translationMissing
If this was not the last member the player needed to recruit~|~translationMissing
What an exhausting workout. I hope the others aren't as much effort to recruit.~|~translationMissing
If this was the last member the player needed to recruit~|~translationMissing
Well, that's everyone. I guess I should head off the entrance on the west side of Ice Mountain.[confirmation needed]~|~translationMissing
What did you want me to do again?~|~translationMissing
I want you to prove your strength by showing me your muscles!~|~translationMissing
Do you think you'll be able to handle all these rocks?~|~translationMissing
Should not be a problem. This challenge is easy for a [strongman/strongwoman].~|~translationMissing
I wish I could help...~|~translationMissing
Do not worry my friend. If you stay dedicated and keep working everyday, you'll be able to achieve anything you dream of.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Checkal, I will.~|~translationMissing
One last thing - be careful when we go inside. You never know what will happen.~|~translationMissing
Burntof~|~translationMissing
Buy ush a drink.~|~translationMissing
Are you Burntof?~|~translationMissing
I might be, I might not. Buy ush a drink and find out *hic*.~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't got an alcoholic drink~|~translationMissing
Fine... I'll get you a beer.~|~translationMissing
Thanksh a bunch.~|~translationMissing
If the player has an alcoholic drink~|~translationMissing
It just so happens I've got a drink you can have.~|~translationMissing
Giv' it 'ere then.~|~translationMissing
You give Burntof the drink.~|~translationMissing
That'sh good shtuff.~|~translationMissing
So, are you Burntof?~|~translationMissing
Yesh I am *hic*. What can thish dwarf do for you?~|~translationMissing
Willow sent me. She needs your help with a job.~|~translationMissing
Willow? Now that'sh a name I drink to forget!~|~translationMissing
Willow alwaysh insishted on changing me waysh. I knows explosivesh. Just because I lost a couple of me fingersh a few yearsh back doesn't mean I'll do it again *hic*.~|~translationMissing
I knew the exhact amount of dyn*hic*amite needed to blow that rich fool's shafe. We woulda been shet for life!~|~translationMissing
I thought you were a team of archaeologists?~|~translationMissing
Archaeologishts? Shure, if that's what you want to call ush?!~|~translationMissing
Willow sent me to get you. She's found a new digsite and needs your expert knowledge on explosives.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... *hic*~|~translationMissing
Tell you what. If you beat me in a friendly game of rock paper s*hic*cissorsh, I'll join the team.~|~translationMissing
*Whispers* We'll have the game upshtairs away from everyone.~|~translationMissing
Where'sh my beer?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have an alcoholic drink~|~translationMissing
I'll get right on it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Dwarven Stout~|~translationMissing
Ah! A [lad/lass] of fhine taste *hic*. I love Dwarven shtout!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Asgarnian Ale~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Wizard's Mind Bomb~|~translationMissing
No messhing around with you! Only the strong stuff, I like it!~|~translationMissing
Cutscene starts.~|~translationMissing
The rulesh are ash followsh. We both pick a shign to show and then shay 'rock, paper, shcissors.' After schissors, we show our shigns.~|~translationMissing
Thish ish a besht of three game. Nowsh, pick what you are going to shhhow.~|~translationMissing
Round 1~|~translationMissing
What sign will you show?~|~translationMissing
Rock.~|~translationMissing
Paper.~|~translationMissing
Scissors.~|~translationMissing
Burntof chose [winning sign].~|~translationMissing
Looksh like you win the firsht round.~|~translationMissing
But...? I put out [chosen sign]?~|~translationMissing
Yesh, and I put out *hic* [losing sign]... I think.~|~translationMissing
Okay then... I guess the first round goes to me.~|~translationMissing
Round 2~|~translationMissing
Burntof chose [losing sign].~|~translationMissing
I won! That's two rounds to me, so you have to help.~|~translationMissing
Hooold it right there *hic* bud, I thinksh I won that round...~|~translationMissing
But [chosen sign] beats [losing sign]?~|~translationMissing
Yesh, that is correct, but you chose [sign that gets beaten by Burntof's]. So I win.~|~translationMissing
Whatever, let's just play the last round.~|~translationMissing
Round 3~|~translationMissing
Well, it looksh like I win, sho I don't have to help you out.~|~translationMissing
You quickly change your sign to [sign that beats Burntof's].~|~translationMissing
Are you okay Burntof? I clearly beat you. Check my hand again.~|~translationMissing
Merlinsh beard! You did. A deal'sh a deal, I'll help you out.~|~translationMissing
But I think I'll need one more drink before I hitsh the road.~|~translationMissing
Tina! Bring me another beer pleash.~|~translationMissing
Tina~|~translationMissing
Sure thing Burntof, I'll be right there!~|~translationMissing
Tina comes over.~|~translationMissing
Thanksh Tina.~|~translationMissing
If this was not the last member the player needed to recruit (Transcript missing?- This condition is unconfirmed. edit)~|~translationMissing
That was interesting, but that's Burntof recruited. On to the next person.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's everyone. I guess I should head off the entrance on the west side of Ice Mountain.~|~translationMissing
You managed to make your way over to the ruins then?~|~translationMissing
Yush, I did, why's that shuch a *hic* shurprise?~|~translationMissing
I thought you would pass out on your way.~|~translationMissing
Dwarshves have a very good shense of direction and we can *hic* hold our beer very well.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you'll be able to handle the dynamite in your current state?~|~translationMissing
Hah! I could blow thish rubble away with one hand and me eyesh closed.~|~translationMissing
Charlie the Tramp~|~translationMissing
Spare some change guv?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Sorry, I haven't got any.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Go get a job!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ok. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Is there anything down this alleyway?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a man named Marley. Have you seen him?~|~translationMissing
Ah Marley, my cousin. He's always getting himself into trouble!~|~translationMissing
Oh really? Do you know where I could find him?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... it's been a while since I've seen him. Last I heard he got caught in the middle of a robbery and had to flee Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Something to do with trying to steal a set of Wizard robes from the museum.~|~translationMissing
Great, so I'm dealing with a criminal!~|~translationMissing
Afraid so. Marley is no stranger to the authorities... Knowing him, he's probably hanging out in Edgeville ruins till the attention dies down. I'd try there.~|~translationMissing
Perfect. I'll go look for him.~|~translationMissing
Hey there. Would you happen to be Marley?~|~translationMissing
Marley~|~translationMissing
I could be. Depends on who's asking? If you're with the Varrock City Guard, I had nothing to do with the robbery at the museum. I don't even know what I'd do with some Wizard robes.~|~translationMissing
Uhm, no? What robbery? Wizard robes?~|~translationMissing
Robbery? Sorry [sir/miss], first I've heard of a robbery.~|~translationMissing
Look, I'm not here with the city guard, Willow sent me to find you. She needs your help.~|~translationMissing
Willow? Hmm... I'm afraid I don't recall a Willow.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? She said you were old pals.~|~translationMissing
Nope, I'm sure. Only Willow I know of is a type of tree.~|~translationMissing
But, then again, my memory is a bit hazy, due to how hungry I am.~|~translationMissing
You're too hungry... to remember your friend?~|~translationMissing
Yep... been a while since I had a nice hot meal.~|~translationMissing
*Sighs*... would you like me to get you something to eat, to help jog your memory?~|~translationMissing
Oh what a kind offer! I couldn't say no.~|~translationMissing
Fine, I'll be back in a...~|~translationMissing
Woah woah woah, hold your horses there friend! I can't just eat anything. I have very specific dietary requirements.~|~translationMissing
Don't be like that! I don't want nothing fancy, just a Steak sandwich from the Blue Moon Inn, in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Why don't you go and get one then?~|~translationMissing
Slight problem there, friend. I've been barred and the chef won't make me another one. Something about stealing from punters. I can't remember...~|~translationMissing
*Sighs*... Fine. If I go get you this sandwich, will you help Willow?~|~translationMissing
Of course! Oh, by the way, don't bother with the bartender. Just talk to the chef. Trust me.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll be back momentarily with your sandwich.~|~translationMissing
Have you got the sandwich yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm still working on it. Where did you say you got them from?~|~translationMissing
The Blue Moon Inn, in Varrock. They have the best cook around!~|~translationMissing
I'll go speak to them, then.~|~translationMissing
Bartender~|~translationMissing
What can I do yer for?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) A glass of your finest ale please.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you recommend where an adventurer might make his fortune?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you know where I can get some good equipment?~|~translationMissing
Hey, Marley sent me in here for a Steak sandwich.~|~translationMissing
MARLEY?! Don't talk about that sorry state of a person in this establishment!~|~translationMissing
Woah okay, sorry! Forget I ever mentioned him.~|~translationMissing
You'd better clear off before I make you.~|~translationMissing
Cook~|~translationMissing
What do you want? I'm busy!~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you'd be able to make me a Steak sandwich?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... we don't get many food orders in 'ere. Last person to order one of them was barred for thievin'.~|~translationMissing
Oh... uhm... no. It's for me?~|~translationMissing
No... it's for Marley...~|~translationMissing
I knew it! I'm not making another meal for that thievin' git! Clear off.~|~translationMissing
At least tell me why you hate him so much?~|~translationMissing
I know what it's like, not knowin' where your next meals going to come from, so I let him eat 'ere for free.~|~translationMissing
The minute I turn my back, he's caught red-handed trying to pickpocket one of our patrons. We gave him the boot there 'n' then.~|~translationMissing
Well, fair enough, but it's just one sandwich. He's not even in Varrock anymore. He's moved off to Edgeville.~|~translationMissing
No chance mate, it's the principle. I won't make food for such a low class criminal...~|~translationMissing
Please, I really need Marley's help and he'll only offer it if I get him a Steak sandwich.~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose if I give you the recipe, you can make it yourself.~|~translationMissing
Great! I can't imagine it's that hard to make.~|~translationMissing
Watch your mouth! Making a Steak sandwich is a delicate art!~|~translationMissing
Sorry! Of course it is. What's the recipe then?~|~translationMissing
To start, you need to get some prime beef from a cow. The fields around Lumbridge are a great source. Cook it up - medium rare is perfect. Don't cook it for too long or you'll burn it...~|~translationMissing
Then, you take some bread. I recommend making it fresh, but to each their own. Slice it in half and slide the beautifully cooked beef between the two halves...~|~translationMissing
And hey presto, you've got yourself a delicious, perfectly made Steak sandwich.~|~translationMissing
Wow... is that it? Some beef between a loaf of bread?~|~translationMissing
It's harder to make than it sounds! Now get out before I whack you one for being so rude.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you sell me any food?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you give me any free food?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I don't want anything from this horrible kitchen.~|~translationMissing
I forgot the recipe to make a Steak sandwich.~|~translationMissing
For Saradomin's sake! Take some bread, cut it in half and stick some cooked Steak inside, done.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah, thank you!~|~translationMissing
I've managed to make myself a Steak sandwich.~|~translationMissing
Let me take a look at it.~|~translationMissing
You show your Steak sandwich to the cook.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha, you call this a sandwich!?~|~translationMissing
Well, I tried my best...~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you did. It'll be enough for Marley, anyway.~|~translationMissing
Hey Marley. I've managed to get your Steak sandwich.~|~translationMissing
Ah, just in time for my afternoon snack. Pass it over.~|~translationMissing
You give the steak sandwich to Marley.~|~translationMissing
Aaah... not quite as good as the usual, but it hit the spot.~|~translationMissing
Are you finally done?~|~translationMissing
Yes [sir/miss] I am. I'll honour my side of the deal and head off to find Willow.~|~translationMissing
Finally! You can find her on the west side of Ice Mountain.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! I'll be on my way then.~|~translationMissing
If this was not the last member the player needed to convince~|~translationMissing
Marley is certainly an interesting character. Hopefully the next team member is more respectable.~|~translationMissing
If this was the last member the player needed to convince~|~translationMissing
Hello again Marley.~|~translationMissing
Ah, my new favourite chef. Have you got another sandwich for me?~|~translationMissing
Woah! Alright there, calm down. Was only a joke.~|~translationMissing
I don't find being your errand boy very funny.~|~translationMissing
You need to lighten up a little, my friend.~|~translationMissing
That's everyone gathered. Interesting company for an archaeologist to keep...~|~translationMissing
*Shrugs* How many archaeologists do you actually know?~|~translationMissing
Well I-~|~translationMissing
Exactly. So who are you to judge? Anyway, we're all here and ready to break in... Um, I mean excavate... the entrance.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready? Who knows what's inside the ruins?~|~translationMissing
I'm ready as I'll ever be. Let's head in.~|~translationMissing
Cutscene begins.~|~translationMissing
Right, that's everyone gathered. Thank you, [player name], for all your help.~|~translationMissing
Oh it was no pro...~|~translationMissing
Okay everyone, we've wasted enough time. Let's crack this door open. Burntof, you're up!~|~translationMissing
Try not to blow the entire mountain up this time...~|~translationMissing
Yesh ma'am, let'sh get this rock out the way.~|~translationMissing
Screen fades to black.~|~translationMissing
Jusht got to plashe thish here...~|~translationMissing
... little bit of dyn-*hic*-amite here...~|~translationMissing
... and there we go!~|~translationMissing
Now we light the fushe!~|~translationMissing
Screen returns to normal.~|~translationMissing
Burntof lights the fuse~|~translationMissing
Tsssss...~|~translationMissing
What are you doin' standin' there?!~|~translationMissing
Everyone'sh ran for cover [lad/lass]. You'd best do the shame.~|~translationMissing
Wait, what?!~|~translationMissing
Clock'sh ticking [lad/lass]!~|~translationMissing
The player runs off screen, and the rocks blow up, clearing the way to the ruins.~|~translationMissing
Bloomin' 'eck, Burntof!~|~translationMissing
That was a tad too explosive I think.~|~translationMissing
My ears are still ringing!~|~translationMissing
Quit yer moanin', it did the job didnae it?~|~translationMissing
He's right, the rock's been broken up. Checkal, it's your turn.~|~translationMissing
Of course ma'am, I will get to work.~|~translationMissing
Checkal sets to work clearing out the rubble...~|~translationMissing
The work is done, Willow. My apologies if it took too long.~|~translationMissing
Don't be sorry, Checkal. Gotta put those muscles to use somehow.~|~translationMissing
Alright Marley, in you go. Let us know if you find anything.~|~translationMissing
Right, in I go. Wish me luck [player name].~|~translationMissing
Try not to die...~|~translationMissing
Cutscene shifts to Marley, inside the ruins.~|~translationMissing
Right, let's see what hidden surprises you have in store for me.~|~translationMissing
Marley disables a trap.~|~translationMissing
That would have been nasty.~|~translationMissing
Is that it? I thought this place would be better protected.~|~translationMissing
Marley avoids a tripwire.~|~translationMissing
Now to disarm it...~|~translationMissing
Maybe this will work?~|~translationMissing
That got it!~|~translationMissing
Alright guys! It's safe to come in! I think...~|~translationMissing
Wow, this place is amazing. I can't believe this was hidden away.~|~translationMissing
I wonder how long it's been left untouched for.~|~translationMissing
You're impressed? There's nothing here but dust and fallen rocks.~|~translationMissing
Yaaa*hic*aawn~|~translationMissing
You don't find it exciting? As an archaeologist, I thought you would be thrilled at this discovery?~|~translationMissing
Thrilled? What's there to be excited about? I don't see any gold, diamonds, rare gems or piles of lost treasure!~|~translationMissing
It's not about the money though, right? We've potentially discovered the long lost ruins of an ancient civilisation!~|~translationMissing
Of course it's about the money. It's always been about money, you fool.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand...~|~translationMissing
We're not a team of archaeologist, you idiot. We're grave robbers looking for their next score.~|~translationMissing
Theshe markings look familiar...~|~translationMissing
So this entire time, you've just been using me to help break into these ruins in hopes of finding someone else's treasures.~|~translationMissing
Yep, and you were surprisingly easy to convince. I'll admit, you have been a tremendous help, [player name].~|~translationMissing
But your usefulness has come to an end I'm afraid. I can't simply let you leave here.~|~translationMissing
I can't risk you running to the authorities and telling them about our little gang. We're wanted in quite a few large cities across Gielinor.~|~translationMissing
I've sheen thish before...~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid this is the end of the road for you, [player name]. This ruin is about to become your tomb.~|~translationMissing
Burntof steps on a tile, setting something off.~|~translationMissing
*hic* Woops...~|~translationMissing
What was that noise?~|~translationMissing
Uh... it wasn't me!~|~translationMissing
Whats happening?!~|~translationMissing
The ground stops shaking.~|~translationMissing
It feels like the quaking has finally stopped...~|~translationMissing
The rocks by the big doors come to life, becoming an Ancient Guardian.~|~translationMissing
Holy Zamorak! What is that thing?! Checkal, take it down!~|~translationMissing
I'm a muscle man, not a fighter.~|~translationMissing
I think we should get out of here, Willow!~|~translationMissing
You're right, Marley. Burntof, we're leaving!~|~translationMissing
Screen fades to black and the cutscene ends.~|~translationMissing
I can't believe they ran so quickly. I suppose I should take care of this thing.~|~translationMissing
I need a little bit more time to prepare.~|~translationMissing
Hurry up then! We've waited long enough.~|~translationMissing
Are you finally ready to crack these ruins open?~|~translationMissing
That monster showed up at the perfect time. I would have been toast if Willow and her gang had their chance to attack.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of which, maybe they left something behind I can salvage some kind of reward from.~|~translationMissing
Looks like Willow left a bag behind. Maybe there's something in it I could take.~|~translationMissing
You rummage through Willow's bag...~|~translationMissing
You find a pile of coins!~|~translationMissing
Those will do nicely!~|~translationMissing
A sound of doors opening occurs.~|~translationMissing
What was that noise? Please don't be another rock monster...~|~translationMissing
What the!~|~translationMissing
Ramarno~|~translationMissing
Bless my beard...~|~translationMissing
Wow. I honestly didn't expect to see a dwarf in these ruins.~|~translationMissing
I can't believe it...~|~translationMissing
Yeah, exactly.~|~translationMissing
It's been so long since I've heard another person's voice.~|~translationMissing
How did you find me?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, it was all a bit of an accident.~|~translationMissing
There was a gang of... well, I thought were archaeologists, but it turned out they were grave robbers.~|~translationMissing
I helped them clear the entrance to these ruins and we worked our way inside, only to wake up a monster! They ran off and left me to defeat it.~|~translationMissing
That wasn't a monster...~|~translationMissing
Well it looked menacing enough!~|~translationMissing
That was one of the guardians of this once great city.~|~translationMissing
City?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Camdozaal, home of the Imcando Dwarves.~|~translationMissing
These halls once bustled with life, but that was a long time ago. I'm the only one left now. The name's Ramarno.~|~translationMissing
Well Ramarno, I'm [player name], and you have me at a loss for words! I'd have never even imagined there would be a whole city down here.~|~translationMissing
Not much of a city anymore, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
I guess I didn't help with that. Sorry about breaking into your home and killing your guardian.~|~translationMissing
We have plenty more. No real harm done. That said, I do think I might have a way for you to make up for it. There'll likely be something in it for you as well.~|~translationMissing
My workshop is just north of here. Meet me there and we'll talk further.~|~translationMissing
Ramarno departs for his workshop.~|~translationMissing
Ramarno still looks shocked. Perhaps you should talk to him first.~|~translationMissing
So this is where you scampered off to after the monster awoke?~|~translationMissing
Look [player name], it was a simple misunderstanding, that's all...~|~translationMissing
Oh really? You threatening to kill me was just a misunderstanding?~|~translationMissing
Things got a little heated down there, but we all made it out alive, right?~|~translationMissing
Barely... I had to defeat that monster on my own!~|~translationMissing
What are you doing out here, anyway?~|~translationMissing
We thought you'd rat us out to the authorities, so we came out here to hide.~|~translationMissing
Plus, we heard there are some sealed tombs in the desert that haven't been touched in hundreds of years...~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course... scoping out your next grave to rob.~|~translationMissing
[player name], I am so glad to see you are safe.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Checkal. Why didn't you tell me about Willow?~|~translationMissing
I thought we were friends...~|~translationMissing
I am sorry [player name]. I do respect you and your love for the muscle. But sadly I needed the money. These muscles don't pay the bills on their own.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I understand...~|~translationMissing
Please do not let this incident divert you from your path of becoming a [strongman/strongwoman]! I truly believe in you.~|~translationMissing
How you holding up Burntof? Must have had quite the fright when you woke that monster.~|~translationMissing
You're right [lad/lass]. It did give me a little fright.~|~translationMissing
But I saw some interesting things down in the ruins...~|~translationMissing
Some of the markings on the wall look very familiar to me. I've seen them before.~|~translationMissing
Well, when I defeated the monster, an Imcando dwarf opened the barred door...~|~translationMissing
An Imcando dwarf! I thought they were all but extinct! You've found something truly amazing [player name]!~|~translationMissing
I wish I had a drink to celebrate, but this desert is bone dry.~|~translationMissing
Wow, the desert really suits you Marley.~|~translationMissing
[player name] my old pal! How are you doing?~|~translationMissing
Better now I don't have to deal with you. Enjoying life in the desert?~|~translationMissing
Not really. I'm not suited to such harsh climates. No steak sandwiches here either...~|~translationMissing
Oh what a shame! Poor Marley's going to starve as he doesn't have anyone to make his sandwiches... So sad.~|~translationMissing

5.1 Quest ending before the release of Tombs of Amascut on 24 August 2022~|~translationMissing
Jamila~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Looking to buy some of my wares? I also have a special item in stock that I reckon you'll love!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Show me what you have.~|~translationMissing
What's this special item?~|~translationMissing
Oh it's fantastic! However, before we go into the details, you should make some room to carry it.~|~translationMissing
Make some room? But I've not even decided if I want this... whatever it is.~|~translationMissing
I just know that once you see it, you'll want it!~|~translationMissing
Okay... I'll be back soon then.~|~translationMissing
Oh it's fantastic! It's an exclusive item just for you! Consider it a thank you for all you've done for our city.~|~translationMissing
If the player is lower than level 85 combat~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended level of 85.~|~translationMissing
Start the Beneath Cursed Sands quest?~|~translationMissing
Okay, let's have a look.~|~translationMissing
Jamila shows you a gold ring.~|~translationMissing
A ring?~|~translationMissing
Isn't it wonderful! Here, try it on!~|~translationMissing
Jamila tries to put the ring on your finger. As she does, she slips you a message.~|~translationMissing
Ah, it seems the ring is too small. Never mind.~|~translationMissing
Wait... what?~|~translationMissing
Well, time for me to get on with my work. Come back soon.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the offer, but I'll pass.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I see. Well come back if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How is business?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm good, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Looking to buy some of my wares?~|~translationMissing
About that special item...~|~translationMissing
Oh I think you're going to love it!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How's business?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm sorry the ring didn't fit. Still, nothing lost and nothing gained, right?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the message~|~translationMissing
Maybe I should try it on again.~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose you can. But first, you should make some room to carry it.~|~translationMissing
Still too small I'm afraid. Now, it's time for me to get on with my work. Come back soon.~|~translationMissing
If the player did not lose the message~|~translationMissing
But what about...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I have a lot to do. Come back soon.~|~translationMissing
Maisa~|~translationMissing
Good, you made it.~|~translationMissing
I know you! You're Maisa, that spy from Al Kharid. But you're meant to be in Menaphos!~|~translationMissing
I told Osman I was done with that posting, and I meant it.~|~translationMissing
But how did you get out of the city?~|~translationMissing
The same way I helped those citizens of yours. Even with the quarantine, Menaphos are still sending their dead to Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
So you hid yourself among them? I see. Why are you out here though? And why did you send me that message?~|~translationMissing
Because there's something very strange going on. I intend to work out what, but I need your help.~|~translationMissing
Why me?~|~translationMissing
My list of allies grows shorter every day, but you actually seem to care about what's happening out here. You also seem to know what you're doing.~|~translationMissing
Brave of you to assume that I ever actually know what I'm doing.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm sure you can't be worse than Osman. You might even have the guts to take some action if needed.~|~translationMissing
Right... so what are these strange happenings?~|~translationMissing
Citizens from Menaphos have been disappearing. Guards as well. They've been leaving the city, despite the quarantine.~|~translationMissing
They've been bypassing the quarantine? How?~|~translationMissing
No idea, but I have managed to find out where they've been going.~|~translationMissing
South of here, to the old necropolis. They're excavating something there, but I don't know what. There's also something strange going on with them.~|~translationMissing
I went to this excavation of theirs to have a look around, and the way they're acting is very unusual. It's like nothing I've seen before.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. I think I need to see this for myself.~|~translationMissing
Well let me know when you're ready, and I'll take you down there.~|~translationMissing
Let's go.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene starts. The player and Maisa arrive at the necropolis. Citizens can be seen mining and excavating, watched by Menaphite Guards.~|~translationMissing
Look at them! How long have they been doing this?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure, but they're at it both day and night.~|~translationMissing
So they never rest?~|~translationMissing
Doesn't seem so.~|~translationMissing
How weird. Can we get a closer look?~|~translationMissing
Should be able to. When I came to investigate before, I was able to walk right up to them. They didn't even seem to care. It was like they were in some sort of trance.~|~translationMissing
I'm going to have a look around.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep watch here. Try to keep a low profile.~|~translationMissing
I'll try, but low profile isn't really one of my specialties.~|~translationMissing
Oh good. I'll prepare for violence then.~|~translationMissing
Well don't take too long!~|~translationMissing
What are these strange happenings you mentioned?~|~translationMissing
Ready to go and investigate the excavation?~|~translationMissing
I'm still looking.~|~translationMissing
Be careful. There's something creepy about all of this.~|~translationMissing
The entrance is completely blocked. There doesn't seem to be any way through.~|~translationMissing
The entrance is completely blocked. However, the blockage looks to have happened fairly recently. Perhaps it occurred during the excavation.~|~translationMissing
If the player has already talked to a citizen or guard~|~translationMissing
Interesting. I'd better report back to Maisa.~|~translationMissing
Guard cutscene begins.~|~translationMissing
Citizen~|~translationMissing
The work must be completed...~|~translationMissing
If the player has already talked to a guard or citizen~|~translationMissing
If the player has not inspected the blocked entry~|~translationMissing
Hmm... this seems familiar...~|~translationMissing
If the player has already inspected the blocked entry~|~translationMissing
Hmm... this seems familiar... I'd better report back to Maisa.~|~translationMissing
Menaphite Guard~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. The player is approached by a Head Menaphite Guard and two Menaphite Guards.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hello there.~|~translationMissing
Head Menaphite Guard~|~translationMissing
You should not be here...~|~translationMissing
Really? Why not?~|~translationMissing
The work cannot be disturbed... the mistress commands it...~|~translationMissing
Mistress? You mean the Devourer! This is all her doing, isn't it? I'd recognise her work anywhere.~|~translationMissing
You know too much... you must be removed...~|~translationMissing
Maisa attacks a Menaphite Guard, killing them instantly.~|~translationMissing
Looks like you need a hand.~|~translationMissing
Die...~|~translationMissing
The cutscene ends, and the fight begins with the Head Menaphite Guard.~|~translationMissing
Your false gods will not protect you!~|~translationMissing
You flee from the fight.~|~translationMissing
Come on. We'd better get back down there.~|~translationMissing
Nice job keeping things low profile.~|~translationMissing
To be fair, I did warn you.~|~translationMissing
I suppose. Were you able to discover anything?~|~translationMissing
Sort of. I still don't know why these people are here, but I do know who sent them.~|~translationMissing
Who?~|~translationMissing
Amascut, the Devourer.~|~translationMissing
What? The goddess? You're joking!~|~translationMissing
You don't believe me?~|~translationMissing
It's just quite the claim. How do you know it's her?~|~translationMissing
She has hypnotic powers. She's the one that put them in this trance! I know it better than most. I was unlucky enough to experience it myself back in Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
Urgh...~|~translationMissing
Perhaps this one can give us something more to go on.~|~translationMissing
What's happening? Help me...~|~translationMissing
You were hypnotised, but you're free now. Do you remember anything about what happened to you?~|~translationMissing
It's all so unclear... I can't remember...~|~translationMissing
I know what you're going through. Try to think back to before you were hypnotised. What's the last thing you remember?~|~translationMissing
We were told we had an audience with Pharaoh Kemesis, but when we arrived at the palace he wasn't there. It was just this woman.~|~translationMissing
What woman?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I just remember her eyes, her deep red eyes...~|~translationMissing
That's Amascut alright.~|~translationMissing
Do you remember anything after that?~|~translationMissing
We came here to find something... I think. A tomb! We unblocked the entrance, and she went inside. There were others with her.~|~translationMissing
What does she want from the tomb?~|~translationMissing
I don't know... We never saw the inside. The entrance collapsed again after she went in.~|~translationMissing
That's okay. You've been a great help.~|~translationMissing
Wait! I remember one more thing... there were these monsters helping her! They walked like humans, but they had the heads of insects!~|~translationMissing
That sounds like those scarab creatures from the tunnels below Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
Scabarites! Do you know where they came from?~|~translationMissing
Some ruins... To the north east...~|~translationMissing
I think that's all we're learning from this one. I'll get him some medical attention. Meet me back at my camp.~|~translationMissing
The work must be completed... the mistress commands it...~|~translationMissing
So that was... interesting. A hypnotising goddess wasn't quite what I expected.~|~translationMissing
You sound like you still don't believe me.~|~translationMissing
You have to admit, it's a lot to take in. Still, I guess it doesn't change our next steps.~|~translationMissing
And what are they?~|~translationMissing
That guard gave us two leads to look into. Hopefully one of them will give us some answers as to what's so important about that tomb.~|~translationMissing
Should we reach out to Osman about this?~|~translationMissing
Osman? Why? That man won't be of any help. He'd have happily left me to rot in Menaphos, just like how he sent Kaleef to his death!~|~translationMissing
Kaleef? He was the spy that was meant to relieve you, right? I thought you didn't even know him?~|~translationMissing
What? Oh, right.~|~translationMissing
Look, we don't need Osman. We can handle this ourselves.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough... so what are our leads?~|~translationMissing
First up we have Kemesis, Pharaoh of Menaphos.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about him?~|~translationMissing
Truth be told, not a lot. He's probably the most powerful man in the Kharidian Desert, but he's incredibly reclusive. He's rarely seen in public.~|~translationMissing
If he's under Amascut's control, that could be a big problem. Do you know how we could get to him?~|~translationMissing
Even without the quarantine, it would be incredibly difficult. His palace is a fortress.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound hopeful.~|~translationMissing
It isn't. While there may be ways out of Menaphos, I don't know of any way back in again, let alone a way into the Pharaoh's own palace.~|~translationMissing
We'll leave that lead for now then. What about the other one?~|~translationMissing
The guard mentioned some scabarites. Perhaps we can learn something from them. He said they came from some ruins north east of the necropolis.~|~translationMissing
That would put the ruins directly east of here. All I see are cliffs.~|~translationMissing
Maybe there's something on the other side of them?~|~translationMissing
Could be worth exploring, I guess.~|~translationMissing
Right, so we have our leads. One seems impossible to follow, but the other might have some promise. While I think about how we can access Menaphos, do you want to look into these ruins?~|~translationMissing
Sure, but where do you even plan to start?~|~translationMissing
If we're ever going to get close to the Pharaoh, the Menaphos quarantine has to end. Kemesis himself has made it clear that will only happen when the plagues in Sophanem are eradicated.~|~translationMissing
From what I hear, they've managed to deal with most of them now. That just leaves the pox they're all infected with.~|~translationMissing
So what, you're going to cure the pox?~|~translationMissing
Surely if it were that simple, the High Priest would have done it by now.~|~translationMissing
Have you met that man? He can try to present himself as a wise leader all he wants, but it's just a facade. The lizards around here have bigger brains than him, and that's probably still an insult to the lizards.~|~translationMissing
He didn't even have the guts to get rid of the plagued animals. The guards had to put them down themselves. And it's not like they can do that to the citizens!~|~translationMissing
Well, they could. But I imagine that would be considered quite rude.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I reckon I might have a chance of succeeding where the High Priest failed. I have an old friend in Nardah named Zahur. She's a herbalist. I think she might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
While I go and visit her, you see if you can find these ruins. Remember, they should be just east of here. Meet me in Nardah once you have something.~|~translationMissing
Alright, good luck.~|~translationMissing
Maisa leaves the camp.~|~translationMissing
So what are these leads you mentioned?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a tinderbox~|~translationMissing
You search through the camping equipment, but find nothing of interest.~|~translationMissing
You find a tinderbox among the camping equipment, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You find a tinderbox among the camping equipment.~|~translationMissing
The entry is securely sealed. You can't see any obvious way to get it open.~|~translationMissing
It's an old pillar with a disc shaped gap on one side. An inscription on it reads~|~translationMissing
'The scarabs make their homes in the great halls below.'~|~translationMissing
Place the scarab emblem in the gap?~|~translationMissing
You place the scarab emblem in the gap. It fits perfectly.~|~translationMissing
It's an ancient furnace that hasn't been used in a long time. It looks like it might still work, but it needs refuelling with coal and lighting with a tinderbox.~|~translationMissing
If the player has coal~|~translationMissing
Continues with refuel dialogue.~|~translationMissing
You'll need to refuel the furnace with coal before you can light it.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have coal~|~translationMissing
You need some coal to refuel the furnace.~|~translationMissing
Refuel the furnace?~|~translationMissing

The scarab mould is too big to work with this furnace.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the scarab mould and no iron bar~|~translationMissing
You need an iron bar to use the scarab mould.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the scarab mould and an iron bar~|~translationMissing
Craft a scarab emblem?~|~translationMissing
You craft a scarab emblem.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the scarab mould~|~translationMissing
(Shows normal smelting interface.)~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the tablet~|~translationMissing
You search the well, but find nothing of interest.~|~translationMissing
You search the well and find an old stone tablet at the bottom, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You search the well and find an old stone tablet at the bottom.~|~translationMissing
Your spade hits an old chest, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You dig up an old chest.~|~translationMissing
The chest has a seven digit lock. What would you like to enter? (player input)~|~translationMissing
If the entry is incorrect~|~translationMissing
You input [number], but the chest remains locked.~|~translationMissing
If the entry is correct~|~translationMissing
You unlock the chest and recover a scarab mould from within.~|~translationMissing
If the rotation is incorrect~|~translationMissing
You position the emblem, but nothing happens.~|~translationMissing
If the rotation is correct~|~translationMissing
You hear a click from the nearby entry.~|~translationMissing
Hello! You must be the scabarites I'm looking for.~|~translationMissing
I'm guessing you're going to try and kill me now?~|~translationMissing
I'll take the silence as a yes...~|~translationMissing
There are four emblems slotted into the plaque. You take them.~|~translationMissing
As you pull the lever, you hear a strange ticking sound.~|~translationMissing
The ticking stops and you hear a rumbling sound from somewhere nearby.~|~translationMissing
As you pull the lever, the ticking stops and you hear a loud click.~|~translationMissing
You've been stunned!~|~translationMissing
There are four emblems slotted into the plaque, but you don't have enough room to take them.~|~translationMissing
There are three emblems slotted into the plaque, but you don't have enough room to take them.~|~translationMissing
There are three emblems slotted into the plaque. You take them.~|~translationMissing
There are two emblems slotted into the plaque, but you don't have enough room to take them.~|~translationMissing
There are two emblems slotted into the plaque. You take them.~|~translationMissing
There's an emblem slotted into the plaque, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
There's an emblem slotted into the plaque. You take it.~|~translationMissing

The [location] urn is empty.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has the baboon emblem~|~translationMissing

Spirit~|~translationMissing
Curious... It has been a long time since I've spoken to another. The last time was when my body still had form. Tell me, stranger, what brings you to my tomb?~|~translationMissing
I was looking for some scabarites.~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes. The fallen remnants of my once great sect. You will find plenty of them here. Why do you seek them?~|~translationMissing
Do you know of Amascut, the Devourer?~|~translationMissing
All too well.~|~translationMissing
There's an old tomb south of here. Amascut has been excavating the entrance, and the scabarites have been helping her. She's looking for something inside, but I don't know what.~|~translationMissing
Mehhar~|~translationMissing
I see. If you are an enemy of the Devourer and her corrupt scabarites, then you are a friend to me. I am Mehhar, and I can help you.~|~translationMissing
You can help? Do you know of this tomb?~|~translationMissing
Even when I still lived, the desert hid many secrets. Now, centuries later, it hides even more. Of all those secrets, few are greater than the ones hidden in that tomb.~|~translationMissing
Whose tomb is it?~|~translationMissing
It is the resting place of my father, Osmumten. He was once Pharaoh of these lands. My destiny was to succeed him, but the usurpers saw an end to that.~|~translationMissing
And what are the secrets in his tomb?~|~translationMissing
Being a Pharaoh offers many luxuries, both in life and in death. Many strive only for these luxuries. They forget that being a Pharaoh also comes with responsibility.~|~translationMissing
My father had a responsibility greater than most. At the time of his rule, our people were locked in a great war. To hold back the Ruinous Powers, our gods granted us immensely powerful weapons.~|~translationMissing
When the war was over, my father was tasked with hiding those weapons, lest they fall into nefarious hands. Two of them were buried with him. They will be what the Devourer seeks.~|~translationMissing
What are these weapons?~|~translationMissing
I trust you are aware of what the Devourer desires?~|~translationMissing
Souls?~|~translationMissing
Yes. When the war ended and the Devourer rose from the ashes, she did so with only one goal. She will not stop until every soul, living or dead, has been destroyed.~|~translationMissing
And these weapons can help her?~|~translationMissing
Many would call the Devourer a god, but they speak only half truths. She is a demi-goddess of limited power, and does not possess the means to devour souls on a mass scale.~|~translationMissing
The weapons in my father's tomb can be used to drain a being of divine energy and transfer that energy to another. If used correctly, they would grant the Devourer true godhood.~|~translationMissing
Then I need to get into that tomb and stop her.~|~translationMissing
Before you leave, I ask that you remember your original purpose here.~|~translationMissing
The scabarites?~|~translationMissing
Yes. They have made their home here in my tomb, disturbing my rest. From the chamber above, the High Priest of Scabaras commands them.~|~translationMissing
He believes he does so in the name of Scabaras. He does not realise that he is actually a puppet of the Devourer.~|~translationMissing
Free him of her control, and the Devourer will be without a powerful resource. It will also allow me to rest once more.~|~translationMissing
He might also know more about what Amascut is planning. I did free a guard from Amascut's control through combat. I could try that again.~|~translationMissing
When the Devourer first emerged, Icthlarin himself taught us an incantation to free an individual from her control. I would suggest you use it, rather than risking harm to the High Priest.~|~translationMissing
Ah, that seems wise. What's this incantation?~|~translationMissing
'Majaan, Manand, Almuk.' Be warned, while it will work on those she has hypnotised, it will have no effect on her corrupted akhs. They are sadly beyond saving.~|~translationMissing
I see. Thank you, Mehhar.~|~translationMissing
You will find a key to the upper chamber in an urn to the back of this room. Now go, with the blessing of Scabaras.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more about yourself.~|~translationMissing
In life I was Mehhar, son of Osmumten. To me, my death was mere moments ago. To you on the other hand, I am surely considered ancient.~|~translationMissing
How ancient?~|~translationMissing
I sense that the gods have long since departed this world, but when I lived, they still walked among us.~|~translationMissing
And your father, Osmumten? You said he was the Pharaoh. What happened?~|~translationMissing
My father ruled during the great war. While the war was eventually won, many considered the cost too great. My father led us with the support of the gods, yet he was the one people blamed.~|~translationMissing
So they killed him?~|~translationMissing
Him, and the rest of my family. I would have died as well, were it not for the bravery of my father's servants. They gave their lives, so that I might live.~|~translationMissing
And then you came here?~|~translationMissing
To Ullek? Yes. I found solace here with a group dedicated to Scabaras. In time, I became their leader, and the Sect of Scabaras was formed.~|~translationMissing
There's not much left of Ullek now, or the sect.~|~translationMissing
That is no surprise. Such is the fate of all things. Still, while the sect would have eventually decayed, it was the Devourer's corruption that quickened its demise.~|~translationMissing
Don't be. You have a chance to free the High Priest of Scabaras. If you do, the sect may yet be reborn.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about Amascut?~|~translationMissing
The one you call Amascut died long ago. In her place, the Devourer was born.~|~translationMissing
How did it happen?~|~translationMissing
Only Icthlarin himself knows the true answer to that question.~|~translationMissing
Okay... but you must have some idea?~|~translationMissing
During the great war, our forces were decimated by the servants of the Ruinous Powers. To turn the tide, Icthlarin and Amascut sought powerful allies to aid us.~|~translationMissing
They found them far from here, in a place beyond this world. A powerful race of faceless ones. They became Icthlarin's Stern Judges.~|~translationMissing
What's that got to do with Amascut?~|~translationMissing
Upon her return, Amascut vanished. She played no further part in the war. Only when the fighting was over did she reappear, but it wasn't really her at all.~|~translationMissing
So you think it had something to do with the Stern Judges?~|~translationMissing
It seems highly likely.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more about the war you mentioned.~|~translationMissing
It started during the rule of my grandmother. An ever-expanding empire to the north set their sights on our lands. War soon broke out.~|~translationMissing
The armies of the Ruinous Powers were far stronger than our own. That was until Icthlarin's Stern Judges joined the fray. Thanks to them, the war was seemingly won.~|~translationMissing
It wasn't really though, was it?~|~translationMissing
No. Among the Stern Judges, there was a serpent. After my father became Pharaoh, this serpent convinced the others to abandon us.~|~translationMissing
They joined the enemy?~|~translationMissing
They did. We were powerless against a force of that might. Nothing could stop their advance.~|~translationMissing
So how did the war end?~|~translationMissing
It was Tumeken himself. He sacrificed himself to annihilate the enemy. The cost was great, but the war was won.~|~translationMissing
So Tumeken died?~|~translationMissing
That's a matter of perspective. I died long ago, and yet we are still having this conversation.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't really answer my question.~|~translationMissing
While Tumeken himself may be gone, he lives on through his four avatars. While they walk among us, Tumeken will always be at our side.~|~translationMissing
Scabaras be with you.~|~translationMissing
I need to get into your father's tomb and stop Amascut.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. How do I access the upper chamber?~|~translationMissing
You will find a key in an urn at the back of this room. May Scabaras guide you to success.~|~translationMissing
You search the urn and find a rusty key, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You search the urn and find a rusty key.~|~translationMissing
High Priest of Scabaras~|~translationMissing
Intruder! You are not welcome here!~|~translationMissing
Fear not! I am here to rescue you!~|~translationMissing
Kill him!~|~translationMissing
Wait! Majaan, Manand...~|~translationMissing
Silence! Champion, protect your High Priest!~|~translationMissing
Fine. We'll do it your way.~|~translationMissing
Hello again.~|~translationMissing
Have you freed the High Priest of Scabaras yet?~|~translationMissing
You should do so soon.~|~translationMissing
Stay back!~|~translationMissing
Majaan, Manand, Almuk.~|~translationMissing
Argh!~|~translationMissing
What... What happened?~|~translationMissing
It's alright. You were being controlled by Amascut, but you're free now.~|~translationMissing
I... I don't remember.~|~translationMissing
I've been in your position. Don't worry, your memories will come back in time. Familiar places and objects can help them come back faster.~|~translationMissing
This room is familiar... as I look around, I feel something stirring...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I can see it now! There are a few gaps, but it's all coming back to me. Thank you, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
There is much for me to set right. We have made some terrible mistakes.~|~translationMissing
I know the feeling. What did she have you do?~|~translationMissing
Many things. I have been under her control my whole life. It was the same for my predecessor, and her predecessor as well. We were all slaves to the Devourer, even our lord himself.~|~translationMissing
She controls Scabaras?~|~translationMissing
Yes. She used him as her puppet for centuries, but now she has a new plan for him.~|~translationMissing
What new plan?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. She took him into some tomb, along with the others.~|~translationMissing
Osmumten's tomb. Who are these others you speak of?~|~translationMissing
Apmeken, Crondis and Het. The other avatars of Tumeken.~|~translationMissing
She has them all?~|~translationMissing
She does. We helped her capture them. It took many lifetimes, but she was able to fool them all.~|~translationMissing
This isn't good. There're weapons in that tomb that can transfer divine power between beings. She must be planning to use them on the lesser deities.~|~translationMissing
The four of them all came from Tumeken himself. Their power is his power. If she claims that power as her own, she will become a true goddess...~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll make sure that doesn't happen.~|~translationMissing
How can you hope to withstand her power?~|~translationMissing
I'll find a way. Do you have any other information that can help me?~|~translationMissing
We were not the only ones to fall to the Devourer. She has control over Pharaoh Kemesis of Menaphos.~|~translationMissing
We feared as much. Do you know what she wants with him?~|~translationMissing
She needed control over the city, but she kept the reason a secret. She even had us release locusts and frogs into Sophanem so she could have Menaphos locked down.~|~translationMissing
You caused the plagues? The cows and the pox as well?~|~translationMissing
We did also poison the cows. I know nothing of this pox, though.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... what will you do now?~|~translationMissing
I fear many of my people are forever lost, but I will save as many as I can. Together, we will reform the Sect of Scabaras, and right the wrongs of the Devourer.~|~translationMissing
So you'll help me fight her?~|~translationMissing
In our own way. Before the Devourer, we were an isolated people, just as Scabaras taught us to be. We will go back to that way of life.~|~translationMissing
We may go unseen, but we will be there, fighting the forces of the Devourer wherever they appear.~|~translationMissing
Good to hear. Now, I'd better head over to Nardah. I have a friend there who needs to hear about all of this.~|~translationMissing
Good luck in your fight, adventurer. May Scabaras guide you.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any other information about Amascut that could help me?~|~translationMissing
Hello, adventurer. Thank you for freeing me from the Devourer. I would be alone now. Scabaras teaches us to remain isolated, and I have much to think about.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Mehhar.~|~translationMissing
I sense that the Devourer's corruption has been lessened. I trust you were successful?~|~translationMissing
The High Priest is free.~|~translationMissing
You have my thanks.~|~translationMissing
Does this mean you can rest now?~|~translationMissing
That was my hope, but while the High Priest is free, many scabarites have been lost to the Devourer. I sense that they will soon descend on my tomb, hoping to reclaim it.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything I can do to help?~|~translationMissing
Continue your fight against the Devourer. Only with her defeat, will we finally find freedom.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Ah, there you are. Any luck in those ruins?~|~translationMissing
Plenty. I discovered all sorts of things. How about you?~|~translationMissing
I filled Zahur in on our discoveries and obtained a blood sample from one of Sophanem's citizens for her. Don't ask me how. She's looked over it, and thinks the pox should be easily curable.~|~translationMissing
Great!~|~translationMissing
Zahur~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's a very interesting one this. Do you know of the cadava bush?~|~translationMissing
Yes! One time I used some to help this young couple. I gave one of them a cadava potion to appear dead.~|~translationMissing
It all went a bit wrong though, and he ended up with her cousin instead...~|~translationMissing
Right...~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Making Friends with My Arm~|~translationMissing
Oh, and I used one another time when I was helping My Arm!~|~translationMissing
You were helping your arm? I'm not sure I need to know about your private life...~|~translationMissing
No, not my arm. My Arm! He's a troll! He needed to kill an old man, so we used a potion to fake it.~|~translationMissing
It all went a bit wrong though... again. That seems to happen quite often for some reason...~|~translationMissing
What on Gielinor are you on about?~|~translationMissing
Maybe we should get back to what I was saying...~|~translationMissing
As most people know, cadava berries are quite poisonous. When used in the right quantity, they can put someone into a deep sleep. Use the wrong amount...~|~translationMissing
... and you're not going to be waking up again. Cadava potions are standard issue for Al Kharid spies for that very reason. In fact, they're what I used to get myself and those citizens out of Menaphos.~|~translationMissing
Well, the thing about cadava berries is that they're not the only part of the bush that's dangerous. If you're not careful, the bark can have quite a nasty effect on the skin.~|~translationMissing
Like the spots from the pox! Are you saying that's what caused all the trouble? A rogue cadava bush?~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but you won't find any of those bushes this far south. It's quite unexpected. I don't think anyone in Sophanem would even recognise cadava bark, let alone figure out it caused the pox.~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I probably wouldn't have suspected it myself either. I only realised because of the time I spent training with the Apothecary in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
It sounds like someone could have caused the pox on purpose.~|~translationMissing
Well that leads on to what I discovered in those ruins. I found the High Priest of Scabaras there, under Amascut's control. Turns out she had him and the scabarites cause the plagues in Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
They caused the plagues? Why?~|~translationMissing
Amascut wanted an excuse to have Menaphos locked down. She's up to something there, but the High Priest of Scabaras didn't know what. However, he did confirm that Pharaoh Kemesis is under her control as well.~|~translationMissing
The thing is, now that I think about it, the High Priest of Scabaras didn't actually seem to be aware of the pox. I doubt he'd have been able to get hold of cadava bark either.~|~translationMissing
So there's other forces at play. That's not good. What else did you find out?~|~translationMissing
The next bit is worse, I'm afraid. I found out what Amascut is looking for in that tomb. Apparently, there are two weapons in there that could grant her true godhood.~|~translationMissing
True godhood? You can't be serious!~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid so. She's managed to capture all four of the lesser gods. It's likely that her plan is to use the weapons to claim their power.~|~translationMissing
The lesser gods? It can't be!~|~translationMissing
Are you really sure about all of this?~|~translationMissing
Do not doubt the will of the Devourer, Maisa. She is a force of pure evil.~|~translationMissing
It wasn't that long ago that I didn't even think she was still around. Now I'm hearing she's trying to become a true goddess! It's a lot to get used to.~|~translationMissing
I do have one bit of good news. I know an incantation that can free a person from her mind control. We can use it to free the people at the necropolis.~|~translationMissing
Right, well we'd better get to work then. First, let's finish off this cure. Once that's done, we can free the citizens.~|~translationMissing
Anything you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
Maisa has already obtained most of what I need. All that's left now is some scarab venom and a Lily of the Elid.~|~translationMissing
Okay, let's split up. I'll get the scarab venom.~|~translationMissing
And I guess that leaves the Lily of the Elid for me. From the name, I assume they grow near the river?~|~translationMissing
That's right. I know of a small island just west of here where you can find some.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
As will I.~|~translationMissing
Maisa departs.~|~translationMissing
So what did you find in those ruins?~|~translationMissing
I found the High Priest of Scabaras there, under Amascut's control. Turns out she had him and the scabarites cause the plagues in Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Do you need anything?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Please clean all my herbs.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Please decant my potions.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get a Lily of the Elid?~|~translationMissing
There's a small island just west of here where you should be able to find some.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) More options...~|~translationMissing
Hello there crocodile. I think I'll call you Roger. You're looking very hungry, Roger.~|~translationMissing
Roger stares at you.~|~translationMissing
I think I'd better find something to distract you with before I try getting any closer.~|~translationMissing
If the player has meat~|~translationMissing
(Continues with meat dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
You'll need to distract Roger before you can cross.~|~translationMissing
Give Roger some meat?~|~translationMissing
If the player uses raw beef~|~translationMissing
You give Roger some meat. He happily takes it before swimming away. You feel that you have connected with Roger on a deep level. The two of you are now firm friends.~|~translationMissing
If the player user cooked meat~|~translationMissing
If the player has enough inventory space~|~translationMissing
You pick the lily.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough inventory space~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough room to take the lily.~|~translationMissing
If the player already picked the lily~|~translationMissing
You've already picked the lily that was growing here.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back. Do you have a Lily of the Elid?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the lily~|~translationMissing
Well, there's a small island just west of here where you can find some.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
You give the Lily of the Elid to Zahur.~|~translationMissing
I think I have everything I need to make the cure now.~|~translationMissing
Can I help with anything else?~|~translationMissing
Actually, I think you can. To make the cure, I'll need to get the ingredients to just the right temperature. While I get them prepared, could you get my equipment heated up?~|~translationMissing
How do I do that?~|~translationMissing
Just adjust the individual heats until the overall temperature is at the marked level. Be warned, the equipment can be a bit temperamental sometimes.~|~translationMissing
Hey. You should help Zahur with her equipment.~|~translationMissing
What do I need to do to this equipment?~|~translationMissing
Excellent! I think I have it!~|~translationMissing
Now, it's going to take a few batches of this to cure everyone in Sophanem. I'll get started on those right away. In the meantime, I can give you the first batch to take down there now.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I can deliver it to the High Priest of Icthlarin.~|~translationMissing
Meet me back at the necropolis once you're done.~|~translationMissing
Maisa departs for the necropolis.~|~translationMissing
Here's the first batch for you to take to the High Priest of Icthlarin. Let him know that I'll be sending down the rest once it's done.~|~translationMissing
Zahur tries to give you a crate full of cure vials, but you don't have enough room for it.~|~translationMissing
Zahur gives you a crate full of cure vials.~|~translationMissing
Do you have that first batch of cure for me?~|~translationMissing
Yes, here it is. Let the High Priest know that I'll be sending down the rest once it's done.~|~translationMissing
I lost that crate you gave me.~|~translationMissing
You lost a whole crate? How?~|~translationMissing
Well I have the next batch ready now, so you can take that.~|~translationMissing
Where do I need to take this crate?~|~translationMissing
It needs delivering to the High Priest of Icthlarin in Sophanem. Let him know that I'll be sending down the rest once it's done.~|~translationMissing
High Priest~|~translationMissing
Hello. How are things going here?~|~translationMissing
We're making progress on those plagues. With our citizens back, we had enough people to finally drive out the frogs and locusts that were filling the town up.~|~translationMissing
We worried they'd just come back, but perhaps we have managed to appease whichever god sent them.~|~translationMissing
The infected cows have been dealt with as well. The only plague left now is this infuriating pox. Still, at least it isn't contagious.~|~translationMissing
Well, I think I might be able to help with that.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the crate~|~translationMissing
Oh... I was meant to bring you something, but it seems I've forgotten it. I'll be right back.~|~translationMissing
You give the crate to the High Priest.~|~translationMissing
What's this crate?~|~translationMissing
If all goes well, the potions in there should cure the pox. Sophanem will finally be free of the plagues. This is just the first batch. More will come soon.~|~translationMissing
Free of the plagues? How is this possible? We tried everything!~|~translationMissing
Well I just found a good herbalist. What did you try?~|~translationMissing
Er... mostly I prayed to Icthlarin and hoped for the best.~|~translationMissing
Right... Well I have some things to do down at the necropolis. I'll be back to see how the potions are working once I'm done.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, friend. You are once again our saviour!~|~translationMissing
Thank you for bringing us that cure. We will hopefully start seeing the effects soon.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure it won't take long. I'll be back to see for myself once I'm done at the necropolis.~|~translationMissing
Hey there. Everything go okay with the High Priest?~|~translationMissing
I think so. I guess we'll see for sure soon.~|~translationMissing
Well in the meantime, do you think this incantation will work?~|~translationMissing
It did when I used it on the High Priest of Scabaras, so we shouldn't have any issues here.~|~translationMissing
Let's not waste any more time then.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene starts. The player and Maisa walk towards the citizens and Menaphite Guards.~|~translationMissing
Looks like we have a welcome party.~|~translationMissing
You have been warned before... leave, now...~|~translationMissing
Amascut's hold on you all is at an end. Majaan, Manand, Almuk.~|~translationMissing
My... my head...~|~translationMissing
You were all enthralled by the Devourer, but you're free now. Things will be confusing at the moment, but your memories will return in time.~|~translationMissing
The Devourer? It can't be!~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid so.~|~translationMissing
You've all been through a lot, but unfortunately you won't be able to return to Menaphos. The city remains locked down.~|~translationMissing
You should seek refuge in Sophanem or one of the other nearby settlements. Hopefully you'll be able to go home soon.~|~translationMissing
You saved us!~|~translationMissing
Thank you!~|~translationMissing
The scene pans to the Jaltevas Pyramid entrance.~|~translationMissing
Well... that's quite the blockage.~|~translationMissing
Clearing it is going to take work. A lot of work.~|~translationMissing
And time isn't on our side. Amascut is already in there looking for those weapons.~|~translationMissing
Two citizens approach the player and Maisa.~|~translationMissing
Excuse me...~|~translationMissing
Sorry to interrupt, but we can help.~|~translationMissing
We can mine away the blockage for you.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? You've already been out here so long.~|~translationMissing
The Devourer made us her slaves. We want to help you stop her.~|~translationMissing
We'll get to work at once.~|~translationMissing
It's still going to be a bit longer before the cure starts to work. I guess we should head back to my camp for now.~|~translationMissing
The scene pans to Maisa's camp.~|~translationMissing
Stop!~|~translationMissing
Stay quiet!~|~translationMissing
I know you're here! Come out!~|~translationMissing
Osman makes himself visible.~|~translationMissing
Osman~|~translationMissing
Impressive, Maisa.~|~translationMissing
Osman! You've been spying on us!~|~translationMissing
That is the job of a spy, Maisa. I remember that, but it seems you do not.~|~translationMissing
What's that supposed to mean?~|~translationMissing
We had a plan, Maisa. You were ordered to stay in Menaphos. Now your recklessness has cost us dearly.~|~translationMissing
Don't lecture me on cost. I know exactly how much this little game of yours has cost.~|~translationMissing
Yes... Kaleef. Did you think I wasn't aware of your little romance?~|~translationMissing
Did you take me for a fool? I've been dealing in deception since before you were born. Yours was not hard to spot.~|~translationMissing
I made the mistake of letting it slide. A poor move on my part. Kaleef's death has clearly impacted your ability to think rationally.~|~translationMissing
Or maybe it just made me see the truth! You're a monster, Osman! You'd see us all dead to get what you want!~|~translationMissing
I serve Al Kharid, Maisa, just as you once did.~|~translationMissing
I'll never stop serving Al Kharid. I've just stopped serving you!~|~translationMissing
Maisa walks away.~|~translationMissing
Soooo...~|~translationMissing
I hope you don't believe yourself innocent in all of this. You have been meddling in affairs that are not your concern.~|~translationMissing
I've only been trying to help.~|~translationMissing
By curing the pox? Tell me, who does that help? Al Kharid or Menaphos?~|~translationMissing
You know, despite all your spying, Al Kharid and Menaphos aren't actually enemies.~|~translationMissing
On paper perhaps, but our two cities were at war for years. Signing a few treaties does not stop us from being enemies.~|~translationMissing
Even if that's true, I don't see why the pox being cured is a problem.~|~translationMissing
It will surely lead to the end of the Menaphos quarantine. That is not to our benefit. We wanted that city isolated.~|~translationMissing
There are larger forces at play here, Osman. That quarantine was helping them far more than it benefitted you.~|~translationMissing
What are you on about?~|~translationMissing
Amascut. She has control over Pharaoh Kemesis. She arranged the quarantine to keep her actions in Menaphos a secret.~|~translationMissing
That's why we made the cure. We need to get in there and find out what she's up to.~|~translationMissing
The Devourer? You speak of legends and fairy tales.~|~translationMissing
You don't believe the gods exist?~|~translationMissing
Maybe once, but that was a long time ago.~|~translationMissing
You're wrong, Osman. The Devourer's behind everything that's been happening down here, and the worst is yet to come. She's looking for some weapons. Ones that could grant her true godhood.~|~translationMissing
And these weapons are in Menaphos?~|~translationMissing
No. She's after something else in Menaphos. We don't know what... yet. The weapons are in a tomb to the south, and she's already in there. She could be using them right now.~|~translationMissing
Pharaoh Kemesis has you fooled. This is clearly some ploy of his to keep us confused and divided. He is our true foe.~|~translationMissing
Osman, you can't...~|~translationMissing
The ground shakes. Lightning strikes the sand and scarlet flames begin to burn.~|~translationMissing
Time to go...~|~translationMissing
Osman! Don't you dare!~|~translationMissing
Menaphite Akh~|~translationMissing
The mistress has tired of your interference...~|~translationMissing
Pray to your false gods... your end comes now...~|~translationMissing
Great! Here we go again.~|~translationMissing
The cutscene ends, and the fight against the Menaphite Akh begins.~|~translationMissing
The entrance is completely blocked. The citizens are slowly mining a way through, but it will take some time.~|~translationMissing
Let's head back to my camp.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you want to leave?~|~translationMissing
Nice of you to help.~|~translationMissing
You had it all in hand. I must say, this has been an interesting development.~|~translationMissing
So do you believe Amascut is involved now?~|~translationMissing
No. I believe what my eyes tell me, and I am yet to see any true evidence that this is the work of an ancient goddess.~|~translationMissing
Oh you've got to be...~|~translationMissing
But I will admit that there is more going on here than I first thought. Dark magic is clearly at play. This may require us to reconsider our approach.~|~translationMissing
What does that even mean?~|~translationMissing
For now, nothing. I need to go and think on this. I suggest you seek out Maisa and see what results your meddling has caused. I'm sure I'll be in touch at some point.~|~translationMissing
Dare I ask for a 'thank you' this time?~|~translationMissing
I imagine Maisa will have gone to Sophanem to check on this cure. She will be waiting for you. Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
Osman departs.~|~translationMissing
That's what I thought. Thanks, Osman.~|~translationMissing
Sorry for leaving you back there. How was your chat with Osman?~|~translationMissing
He seems to have been somewhat enlightened.~|~translationMissing
After you left, we were attacked by one of Amascut's servants. I think they convinced Osman that there's more to all of this than he realised.~|~translationMissing
Maybe he'll finally get his head out of the sand. We don't need him, though. Look at what we've managed on our own.~|~translationMissing
Yes, the cure. Is it working?~|~translationMissing
I'll let the High Priest answer that one.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, friend. Your cure has worked wonderfully. Not a single citizen is infected any more. We're finally free of the plagues!~|~translationMissing
And Menaphos?~|~translationMissing
We sent word to them earlier. They have agreed to meet with us at the bridge. If all goes well, this quarantine will soon be behind us.~|~translationMissing
Let's hope so.~|~translationMissing
Please do join us for the meeting. After all, none of this would have been possible without you.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. The player and Maisa are with the priests of Sophanem, waiting at the bridge.~|~translationMissing
How long do you think we'll need to wait?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. This has probably put Pharaoh Kemesis in an awkward spot. He'll have much to consider.~|~translationMissing
If the quarantine benefits the Devourer, he won't want to end it. Problem is, if he doesn't, it will draw a lot of suspicion.~|~translationMissing
Makes you wonder how much control he actually has left. Does he make any decisions for himself now, or is it all just Amascut?~|~translationMissing
How are you doing, by the way?~|~translationMissing
You know, the stuff Osman said about you and Kaleef.~|~translationMissing
What happened between Kaleef and I is none of your business.~|~translationMissing
If you're sure.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of Osman, that reminds me.~|~translationMissing
Maisa shows you a spear with a keris on the end.~|~translationMissing
He left this for you. I'll leave it in the tent at my camp for you to pick up.~|~translationMissing
He left this for you.~|~translationMissing
His way of saying 'thank you' perhaps?~|~translationMissing
Doubt it. He's probably just trying to keep on your good side.~|~translationMissing
Do you think he's here?~|~translationMissing
If not him, one of his minions will be. He'll want to know what happens at this meeting.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, he wasn't the only one with something for you. This is from the High Priest.~|~translationMissing
Maisa shows you an enchanted circlet.~|~translationMissing
You can pick it up from him once we're done here.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I'll be able to put it to good use.~|~translationMissing
Ah, looks like something's happening.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... is that...?~|~translationMissing
The scene pans to the bridge. Pharaoh Kemesis, Jabari, Coenus, and several Menaphite Guards can be seen. The Pharaoh walks towards the middle of the bridge.~|~translationMissing
Pharaoh Kemesis! I did not expect you to attend to this personally.~|~translationMissing
Pharaoh Kemesis?~|~translationMissing
Pharaoh Kemesis~|~translationMissing
The city of Menaphos will begin preparations to end the quarantine. It will take some time for these preparations to be complete. Good day.~|~translationMissing
Well that was anticlimactic.~|~translationMissing
That's one way of putting it. Still, I wasn't expecting Kemesis himself to make the announcement. It's very unusual for him to appear in public.~|~translationMissing
What do you think it means?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. Until we can get into Menaphos, I doubt we'll find out.~|~translationMissing
He said it would take some time for the city to open.~|~translationMissing
Stalling for as long as possible, no doubt.~|~translationMissing
The citizens should hopefully be nearly done unblocking the entrance to Osmumten's Tomb. I'm going to head down there.~|~translationMissing
As for you, I'd say you've earnt a small break. Take whatever time you need to prepare, then meet me at the tomb once you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll see you soon. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Please take this as a thank you for all your help.~|~translationMissing
The High Priest tries to hand you a Circlet of Water, but you don't have enough room for it.~|~translationMissing
The High Priest hands you a Circlet of Water.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How are things going here?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I should get going.~|~translationMissing
You find a Keris partisan in the tent, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You find a Keris partisan in the tent.~|~translationMissing
I think we've done all we can for the moment. Menaphos is preparing to reopen, and the citizens are unblocking the entrance to Osmumten's Tomb.~|~translationMissing
Until we see some progress in one of those areas, we'll just have to wait. Hopefully it won't be too long.~|~translationMissing
In the meantime, I'll be helping out at the excavation. I think you'll agree that's our top priority.~|~translationMissing
Indeed.~|~translationMissing
Look after yourself. You'll need to be well prepared for what's to come. I'll send word once the entry is cleared.~|~translationMissing

Good day to you, Elena.~|~translationMissing
Elena~|~translationMissing
You too, thanks for freeing me.~|~translationMissing
It's just a shame the mourners confiscated my equipment.~|~translationMissing
What did they take?~|~translationMissing
My distillator. I can't test any plague samples without it. They're holding it in the Mourner Headquarters in West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
I must somehow retrieve that distillator if I am to find a cure for this awful affliction. Do you think you could help me?~|~translationMissing
Start the Biohazard quest?~|~translationMissing
Of course I can help. Where do we start?~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you would say that. Unfortunately they discovered the tunnel and filled it in. We need another way over the wall.~|~translationMissing
Any ideas?~|~translationMissing
My father's friend Jerico is in communication with West Ardougne. He might be able to help us. He lives in a house south east of here, north of the chapel.~|~translationMissing
I'm busy at the moment, I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
Hello Jerico.~|~translationMissing
Jerico~|~translationMissing
Hello, I've been expecting you. Elena tells me you need to cross the wall.~|~translationMissing
My messenger pigeons help me communicate with friends over the wall.~|~translationMissing
I have arranged for two of them to aid you with a rope ladder. Omart is waiting for you at the southern end of the wall.~|~translationMissing
But be careful, if the mourners catch you, the punishment will be severe.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Jerico.~|~translationMissing
The cupboard is full of bird feed.~|~translationMissing
You find some bird feed in the cupboard but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has bird feed~|~translationMissing
I don't need any more bird feed.~|~translationMissing
Mmm, bird feed! Now what could I do with that?~|~translationMissing
Mourner~|~translationMissing
What are you up to?~|~translationMissing
Just sight-seeing.~|~translationMissing
This is no place for sight-seeing. Don't you know there's been a plague outbreak?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I had heard.~|~translationMissing
Then I suggest you leave as soon as you can.~|~translationMissing
What brought the plague to Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
It's all down to King Tyras of West Ardougne. It started came back from one of his visits to the lands west of here.~|~translationMissing
Some of his men must have unknowingly caught it out there and brought it back with them~|~translationMissing
Does he know how bad the situation is now?~|~translationMissing
If he did he wouldn't care. I believe he wants his people to suffer, he's an evil man.~|~translationMissing
Isn't that treason?~|~translationMissing
He's not my king.~|~translationMissing
What are the symptoms of the plague?~|~translationMissing
The first signs are typical flu symptoms. These tend to be followed by severe nightmares, horrifying hallucinations which drive many to madness.~|~translationMissing
Sounds nasty.~|~translationMissing
It gets worse. Next the victim's blood changes into a thick black tar-like liquid, at this point they're past help.~|~translationMissing
Their skin is cold to the touch, the victim is now brain dead. Their body however lives on driven by the virus, roaming like a zombie, spreading itself further wherever possible.~|~translationMissing
I think I've heard enough.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the advice.~|~translationMissing
Omart, Jerico said you might be able to help me.~|~translationMissing
Omart~|~translationMissing
He informed me of your problem traveller. I would be glad to help, I have a rope ladder and my associate, Kilron, is waiting on the other side.~|~translationMissing
Good stuff.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately we can't risk it with the watchtower so close. So first we need to distract the guards in the tower.~|~translationMissing
I reckon some of Jerico's pigeons might help us out here. Chuck some bird feed at the tower and then release some pigeons nearby. They should provide a nice distraction.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get the bird feed and the pigeons?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure Jerico can help you out with that if you ask him nicely.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Have you sorted that distraction yet?~|~translationMissing
Try using some of Jerico's pigeons. Chuck some bird feed at the tower and then release some pigeons nearby. Jerico should be able to help you out.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Have you spoken to Omart yet?~|~translationMissing
I have. He told me to ask you about some pigeons.~|~translationMissing
Pigeons? What do you need my pigeons for?~|~translationMissing
Omart thought they'd make a good distraction for the guards.~|~translationMissing
Ahh, very clever. Well I'm sure I can let you borrow some, as long as you look after them. Just grab one of the cages from behind my house. You'll want some bird feed as well. I should have some in my cupboard.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not near the watchtower fence~|~translationMissing
I probably shouldn't waste it by throwing it here.~|~translationMissing
If the player is near the fence~|~translationMissing
You throw a handful of seeds onto the watchtower. The mourners do not seem to notice.~|~translationMissing
If the player is in the wrong place or has not thrown the bird feed~|~translationMissing
The pigeons don't want to leave.~|~translationMissing
If the player has thrown the bird feed and is near the watchtower fence~|~translationMissing
The pigeons fly towards the watchtower. The mourners frantically try to scare them away.~|~translationMissing
The guards are distracted by the birds, you must go now, quickly traveller.~|~translationMissing
Well done, the guards are having real trouble with those birds. You must go now traveller, it's your only chance.~|~translationMissing
Okay, lets do it.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing a gas mask~|~translationMissing
I'd recommend you wear a gas mask before entering West Ardougne. You don't want to risk catching the plague.~|~translationMissing
That would be wise. Thanks Omart.~|~translationMissing
Omart throws a rope ladder over the wall.~|~translationMissing
You climb up the rope ladder...~|~translationMissing
...and drop down on the other side.~|~translationMissing
Kilron~|~translationMissing
Welcome to West Ardougne friend. I'm Kilron. Let me know if you want to go back over the wall.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Kilron. Do you know where to find the Mourner Headquarters?~|~translationMissing
It's the most north eastern building in the city. Be careful around there.~|~translationMissing
I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Don't take too long, those mourners will soon be rid of those birds.~|~translationMissing
Hello Omart.~|~translationMissing
Hello traveller. Do you wish to cross the wall?~|~translationMissing
Okay, let's do it.~|~translationMissing
You should leave your gas mask on while you're in West Ardougne~|~translationMissing
Hello Kilron.~|~translationMissing
Hello traveller. Do you need to go back over?~|~translationMissing
Yes I do.~|~translationMissing
Okay, quickly now!~|~translationMissing
Kilron throws a rope ladder over the wall.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where to find the Mourner Headquarters?~|~translationMissing
Not yet Kilron.~|~translationMissing
Okay, just give me the word.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Jerico.~|~translationMissing
So you've returned traveller. Did you get what you wanted?~|~translationMissing
Omart will be waiting by the wall, in case you need to cross again.~|~translationMissing
Back away citizen. Only mourners are allowed inside the headquarters.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I wonder if there's another way in.~|~translationMissing
Looks like a nice stew is being prepared. This must be to feed all of the mourners.~|~translationMissing
Hello nurse.~|~translationMissing
Nurse Sarah~|~translationMissing
I don't know how much longer I can cope here.~|~translationMissing
What? Is the plague getting to you?~|~translationMissing
No, strangely enough the people here don't seem to be affected. It's just the awful living conditions that is making people ill.~|~translationMissing
I was under the impression that everyone here was affected.~|~translationMissing
Me too, but that doesn't seem to be the case.~|~translationMissing
You place the rotten apple in the pot. It quickly dissolves into the stew.~|~translationMissing
Anyone who eats this stew is going to have a bad time now.~|~translationMissing
The door is locked.~|~translationMissing
Back away citizen. Several mourners are ill with food poisoning.~|~translationMissing
Is there a doctor nearby? Maybe I can go fetch them.~|~translationMissing
There are no doctors in West Ardougne, just that nurse south west of the chapel. You don't need to worry though, we'll soon have it sorted.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet poisoned the stew or already has a medical gown~|~translationMissing
You search the cupboard but you find nothing of interest.~|~translationMissing
You find a medical gown in the cupboard but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You find a medical gown in the cupboard.~|~translationMissing
A doctor? I didn't think there were any left around here.~|~translationMissing
I heard there was some trouble with food poisoning here.~|~translationMissing
You heard right. Head on in and see what you can do.~|~translationMissing
Stand back citizen, do not approach me.~|~translationMissing
You should leave your medical gown on while you're in the Mourner Headquarters.~|~translationMissing
The trapdoor is bolted on the other side.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear oh dear. I feel terrible, I think it was the stew.~|~translationMissing
You should be more careful with your ingredients.~|~translationMissing
There is one mourner who's really sick. They're resting upstairs. You should see to them first.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
A doctor? At last! I don't know what I've eaten but I feel like I'm on death's door.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... interesting, sounds like food poisoning.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd figured that out already. What can you give me to help.~|~translationMissing
Just hold your breath and count to ten.~|~translationMissing
What? How will that help? What kind of doctor are you?~|~translationMissing
Erm... I'm new, I just started.~|~translationMissing
You're no doctor!~|~translationMissing
(Mourner attacks the player.)~|~translationMissing
The best I can do is pray for you.~|~translationMissing
Pray for me? You're no doctor... You're an imposter!~|~translationMissing
There's nothing I can do, it's fatal.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm too young to die! I've never even had a girlfriend.~|~translationMissing
That's life for you.~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute, where's your equipment?~|~translationMissing
It's erm... at home.~|~translationMissing
The mourner drops a key as he dies.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'd like to be left in peace.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key~|~translationMissing
You use the key to open the gate.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the key~|~translationMissing
You search the crate and find Elena's distillator but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the distillator~|~translationMissing
You search the crate but find nothing of interest.~|~translationMissing
You search the crate and find Elena's distillator.~|~translationMissing
You're back, did you find the distillator?~|~translationMissing
I can't test the samples without the distillator. Please don't give up until you find it.~|~translationMissing
Yes, here it is!~|~translationMissing
Great! Now I can finally run these tests.~|~translationMissing
Elena uses the distillator to test some samples.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand... the touch paper hasn't changed colour at all...~|~translationMissing
What does that mean?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. My old mentor in Varrock, Guidor, might know though. Could you take these to him and see what he thinks? You'll need to drop by the chemist in Rimmington first to pick up some more touch paper.~|~translationMissing
Elena gives you a plague sample along with three vials.~|~translationMissing
Now, last time I went to see Guidor, some one told the guards I was carrying some plague samples. Annoyingly, that means they've started searching everyone going to that part of the city.~|~translationMissing
Ironically, the guards won't be smart enough to recognise the sample itself, so you should be able to get that in just fine. They'll probably confiscate the rest though.~|~translationMissing
So what do I do?~|~translationMissing
Well I know the chemist has still been managing to get chemicals to Guidor. Maybe he can help you smuggle the things in.~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll see if he can help. See you soon.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing back here?~|~translationMissing
I just find it hard to say goodbye sometimes.~|~translationMissing
I see... I understand what you mean... But let's discuss that later.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I've lost some of the stuff that you gave me...~|~translationMissing
If the player has all the items~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? Looks like you have everything to me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing items~|~translationMissing
That's alright, I've got plenty.~|~translationMissing
Elena tries to give you some items but you don't have enough room for them.~|~translationMissing
Elena replaces your lost items.~|~translationMissing
There you go. That should be everything.~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll be on my way.~|~translationMissing
I've forgotten what I need to do.~|~translationMissing
Go to Rimmington and get some touch paper from the chemist. Once you've done that, you'll need to take those things to Guidor in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
You'll probably need to smuggle some of the items in to stop them getting confiscated. If you need help moving them discreetly, the chemist might be able to assist you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll get to it.~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer. I'm afraid it's too risky to use the ladder again. You'll have to find another way into the city.~|~translationMissing
Hello! Playing solitaire?~|~translationMissing
Chancy~|~translationMissing
Hush - I'm trying to perfect the art of dealing off the bottom of the deck.~|~translationMissing
Da Vinci~|~translationMissing
Bah! A great artist such as myself should not have to suffer the HUMILIATION of spending time where the likes of you wander everywhere!~|~translationMissing
Hops~|~translationMissing
Hops don't wanna talk now.~|~translationMissing
What do you want to talk about?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Lamps.~|~translationMissing
Your quest.~|~translationMissing
Chemist~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'm afraid we're just closing now. You'll have to come back another time.~|~translationMissing
But I was sent by Elena from Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
Oh, well that's different then. Must be pretty important for her to send you all this way.~|~translationMissing
She asked me to pick up some touch paper for a guy called Guidor.~|~translationMissing
Guidor? This one's on me then, I owe him more than a few favours.~|~translationMissing
I should warn you though, getting to him might not be easy if you're carrying any chemicals. The guards are searching anyone heading to that part of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Oh right... so am I going to be okay carrying these three vials with me?~|~translationMissing
With touch paper as well? You're asking for trouble. You'd better use my errand boys outside. Give them a vial each. I must warn you though, they do have a habit of stealing things.~|~translationMissing
Well that's no good. How do I stop them stealing my vials?~|~translationMissing
Just make sure you give them something they have no reason to steal. One's a painter, one's a gambler, and one's a drunk. Not ideal I know, but if you pay peanuts you'll get monkeys, right?~|~translationMissing
The chemist gives you some touch paper.~|~translationMissing
Now don't stand around here gassing. This is clearly important to Elena. You'll find Guidor's home in the south east corner of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks for your help. I know Elena appreciates it.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Impling jars.~|~translationMissing
Oh hello, do you need more touch paper?~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the touch paper~|~translationMissing
No thanks.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, don't forget to talk to my errand boys outside if you need help getting things to Guidor. I must warn you though, they do have a habit of stealing things.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the touch paper~|~translationMissing
Okay, here you go.~|~translationMissing
Don't forget to talk to my errand boys outside if you need help getting things to Guidor. I must warn you though, they do have a habit of stealing things.~|~translationMissing
Well that's no good. What if they take my stuff?~|~translationMissing
Hello, I've got a vial for you to take to Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Tssch... that chemist asks for a lot for the wages he pays.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should ask him for more money.~|~translationMissing
Nah... I just use my initiative here and there.~|~translationMissing
You give him the vial of ethenea...~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have ethenea~|~translationMissing
You can't give him what you don't have.~|~translationMissing
You give him the vial of ethenea.~|~translationMissing
Right. I'll meet you at the Dancing Donkey Inn in south east Varrock. Be lucky!~|~translationMissing
You give him the vial of liquid honey...~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have liquid honey~|~translationMissing
You give him the vial of liquid honey.~|~translationMissing
You give him the vial of sulphuric broline...~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have sulphuric broline~|~translationMissing
You give him the vial of sulphuric broline.~|~translationMissing
Look, I've got your vial but I'm not taking two. I always like to play the percentages.~|~translationMissing
Hello, I hear you're an errand boy for the chemist.~|~translationMissing
Well that's my job yes. But I don't necessarily define my identity in such black and white terms.~|~translationMissing
Good for you. Now can you take a vial to Varrock for me?~|~translationMissing
Go on then.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll meet you at the Dancing Donkey in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you again. Please don't distract me now, I'm contemplating the sublime.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I've got something for you to take to Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like pretty thirsty work.~|~translationMissing
Well, there's an Inn in Varrock if you're desperate.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'm a pretty resourceful fellow you know.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll see you in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Sure, I'm a regular at the Dancing Donkey Inn as it happens.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I'd better get going. I'll meet you at the Dancing Donkey Inn.~|~translationMissing
Please don't disturb me, I've got to keep any eye out for suspicious individuals.~|~translationMissing
Halt. I need to conduct a search on you. There have been reports of someone bringing a virus into this area of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
The guard searches you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has ethenea~|~translationMissing
He takes the vial of ethenea from you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has liquid honey~|~translationMissing
He takes the vial of liquid honey from you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has sulphuric broline~|~translationMissing
He takes the vial of sulphuric broline from you.~|~translationMissing
You may now pass.~|~translationMissing
Good morning.~|~translationMissing
Leave me alone. I'm trying to find my gambling buddies!~|~translationMissing
Hi, thanks for doing that.~|~translationMissing
No problem. I've got some money for you actually.~|~translationMissing
Well, it turns out that potion you gave me, was quite valuable...~|~translationMissing
I know that I probably shouldn't have sold it... but some friends and I were having a little wager, the odds were just too good!~|~translationMissing
You sold my vial and gambled with the money?!~|~translationMissing
Actually yes... but praise be to Saradoming[sic] because I won! So all's well that ends well right?~|~translationMissing
No! Nothing could be further from the truth!~|~translationMissing
Well, there's no pleasing some people. Here's your cut anyway.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 10 coins.)~|~translationMissing
You have no idea what you have just done!~|~translationMissing
Ignorance is bliss I'm afraid. Here's your cut anyway.~|~translationMissing
He tries to give you the vial of liquid honey but you don't have enough room for it.~|~translationMissing
He gives you the vial of liquid honey.~|~translationMissing
Next time give me something more valuable... I couldn't get anything for this on the blackmarket.~|~translationMissing
That was the idea.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. I hope your journey was as pleasant as mine.~|~translationMissing
Yep. Anyway, I'll take the package off you now.~|~translationMissing
Package? That's a funny way to describe a liquid of such exquisite beauty!~|~translationMissing
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.~|~translationMissing
Just give me the stuff now please.~|~translationMissing
You do still have it don't you?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely. It's just not stored in a vial anymore.~|~translationMissing
Instead it has been liberated. It now gleams from the canvas of my latest epic~|~translationMissing
The Majesty of Varrock!~|~translationMissing
That's great. Thanks to you I'll have to walk back to East Ardougne to get another vial.~|~translationMissing
Well you can't put a price on art.~|~translationMissing
Well, as they say, it's always sunny in Gielinor.~|~translationMissing
Okay, here it is.~|~translationMissing
He tries to give you the vial of ethenea but you don't have enough room for it.~|~translationMissing
He gives you the vial of ethenea.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, you've been a big help.~|~translationMissing
Hello, how was your journey?~|~translationMissing
Pretty thirst-inducing actually...~|~translationMissing
Please tell me that you haven't drunk the contents...~|~translationMissing
Of course I can tell you that I haven't drunk the contents...~|~translationMissing
But I'd be lying. Sorry about that me old mucker, can I get you a drink?~|~translationMissing
No, I think you've done enough for now.~|~translationMissing
Oh the gods no! What do you take me for?~|~translationMissing
Here's your vial anyway.~|~translationMissing
He tries to give you the vial of sulphuric broline but you don't have enough room for it.~|~translationMissing
He gives you the vial of sulphuric broline.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I'll let you get your drink now.~|~translationMissing
I should probably talk to Guidor before leaving the area. Otherwise I'll need to get my vials smuggled in again.~|~translationMissing
Leave anyway?~|~translationMissing
That's someone's bedroom. I'm not going in there without a reason.~|~translationMissing
Julie~|~translationMissing
Please leave my husband alone. He's very sick, and I don't want anyone bothering him.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do?~|~translationMissing
Thank you, but I just want him to see a priest.~|~translationMissing
A priest? Hmmm...~|~translationMissing
Oh dear! Oh dear! I don't have time to chat!~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'm a friend of Elena, here to see Guidor.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that Guidor is not long for this world! So I'm not letting people see him now.~|~translationMissing
I'm really sorry to hear about Guidor.~|~translationMissing
But I do have some very important business to attend to!~|~translationMissing
You heartless rogue! What could be more important than Guidor's life? A life spent well, if not always wisely... I just hope that Saradomin shows mercy on his soul!~|~translationMissing
Guidor is a religious man?~|~translationMissing
Oh goodness no! But I am! If only I could get him to see a priest!~|~translationMissing
Asyff~|~translationMissing
Now you look like someone who goes to a lot of fancy dress parties.~|~translationMissing
Errr...what are you saying exactly?~|~translationMissing
I'm just saying that perhaps you would like to peruse my selection of garments.~|~translationMissing
Or, if that doesn't interest you, then maybe you have something else to offer? I'm always on the look out for interesting or unusual new materials.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Okay, let's see what you've got then.~|~translationMissing
Do you have a spare Priest Gown?~|~translationMissing
Well I do sell them. I don't hand them out for free though. This is a shop not a charity.~|~translationMissing
Please! It's really important.~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose you can have this old one. It's not in good enough condition to sell.~|~translationMissing
You are given a Priest Gown.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I think I might just leave the perusing for now, thanks.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you make clothing suitable for hunting?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What sort of unusual materials did you have in mind?~|~translationMissing
A priest! thank goodness! My husband is very ill! Perhaps you could read him his last rites?~|~translationMissing
I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Hello, you must be Guidor. I understand that you are unwell.~|~translationMissing
Guidor~|~translationMissing
Is my wife asking priests to visit me now? I'm a man of science for god's sake. I know she means well but it's only a little cough!~|~translationMissing
She made out it was something more serious.~|~translationMissing
Well it's not killed me yet. So what do you want?~|~translationMissing
I've come to ask your assistance in stopping a plague.~|~translationMissing
You mean the plague of West Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
That's the one. I have a sample here from your former student, Elena.~|~translationMissing
Elena eh?~|~translationMissing
Yes, she wants you to analyse it. You might be the only one who can help.~|~translationMissing
Right then, sounds like we'd better get to work!~|~translationMissing
I have the plague sample.~|~translationMissing
Now I'll be needing some liquid honey, some sulphuric broline, and then...~|~translationMissing
... some ethenea?~|~translationMissing
Indeed!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all three vials~|~translationMissing
Look, I need all three reagents to test the plague sample. Come back when you've got them.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have touch paper~|~translationMissing
Oh. You don't have any touch paper. I won't be able to help after all.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the plague sample~|~translationMissing
Seems like you don't actually have the plague sample. It's a long way to come empty handed... and quite a long way back too.~|~translationMissing
Now I'll just apply these to the sample and... I don't get it... the touch paper has remained the same.~|~translationMissing
That's why Elena wanted you to do it, because she wasn't sure what was happening.~|~translationMissing
Well that's just it, nothing has happened. I don't know what this sample is, but it certainly isn't toxic.~|~translationMissing
So what about the plague?~|~translationMissing
This result can only mean one thing... there is no plague. It seems that someone has been lying about all of it. The only question is... why?~|~translationMissing
Well this is worrying. I'd better go and tell Elena right away.~|~translationMissing
I was just going to bless your room and I've done that now.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Goodbye then.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Guidor.~|~translationMissing
Well, hello traveller. I still can't understand why they would lie about the plague.~|~translationMissing
It's strange, anyway how are you doing?~|~translationMissing
I'm hanging in there.~|~translationMissing
Good for you.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I fear Guidor may not be long for this world!~|~translationMissing
King Lathas~|~translationMissing
Leave me citizen. I'm far too busy to talk.~|~translationMissing
You're back! So what did Guidor say?~|~translationMissing
He ran his tests and discovered nothing. The plague... it doesn't exist.~|~translationMissing
Doesn't exist? But I don't understand... why?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, but I think we're about to uncover something huge.~|~translationMissing
Well I think there's only one thing for it. The king must be confronted!~|~translationMissing
The king?~|~translationMissing
Yes. King Lathas of East Ardougne. He was the one that had the wall built. He was the one who called the mourners in. He must know what's really going on here.~|~translationMissing
Well I'd better go and speak to the king then.~|~translationMissing
Be quick. You should find him in the castle.~|~translationMissing
Hello Elena.~|~translationMissing
You must go and see King Lathas immediately!~|~translationMissing
I assume that you are King Lathas of East Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
You assume correctly, but where do you get such impertinence.~|~translationMissing
I get it from finding out that the plague is a hoax.~|~translationMissing
A hoax? I've never heard such a ridiculous thing...~|~translationMissing
I have evidence, from Guidor of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Ah... I see. Well then you are right about the plague. But I did it for the good of my people.~|~translationMissing
When is it ever good to lie to people like that?~|~translationMissing
When it protects them from a far greater danger, a fear too big to fathom.~|~translationMissing
When my father was king, he ruled over a united Ardougne. But on his deathbed, he could not decide which of his sons should succeed him, so he had the city split into two.~|~translationMissing
I became king of East Ardougne while my brother, Tyras, ruled over West Ardougne. My brother was a good man and was great at many things. Being a king was not one of them.~|~translationMissing
Rather than looking after his people, he went on numerous expeditions to the lands west of here. On one of these expeditions, he was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
The Dark Lord agreed to spare his life, but only on one condition... That he would drink from the Chalice of Eternity.~|~translationMissing
So what happened?~|~translationMissing
The chalice corrupted him. He joined forces with the Dark Lord, the embodiment of pure evil...~|~translationMissing
And so I erected the wall, not just to protect my people, but to protect all the people of Gielinor. Tyras is king of West Ardougne, sealing off the city was the only way to stop him and the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
I knew people would never believe the truth, so I had the plague made up as an excuse for the cordon. I'm not proud of it, but it was the only way to keep people safe.~|~translationMissing
I see. Well at least I know now.~|~translationMissing
While my brother is still at large, I must ask that you keep this secret. We can't bring the wall down until we know he is no longer a danger.~|~translationMissing
But how do we stop him?~|~translationMissing
You're willing to help? Gods be praised!~|~translationMissing
My brother is currently gathering strength in the lands to the west. If we are to stop him, we must find a way through the mountains. There is an underground pass that should lead through but it is full of danger.~|~translationMissing
Return to me when you are ready to face this peril. Until then, I give you permission to use my training area. It's located just to the north west of the city.~|~translationMissing
I'll also let the mourners know that you are a friend to Ardougne. You will be allowed to pass through the gates to West Ardougne whenever you please. Now, you'd better be off. You have much to prepare for.~|~translationMissing
Do you need anything else adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Why don't I get started right away?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the requirements for Underground Pass~|~translationMissing
I appreciate your enthusiasm adventurer. However, I fear you are not yet ready for the challenges ahead. Return to me when you are and we will discuss our next steps.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the requirements but a low Ranged level (Transcript missing?- This condition is unconfirmed. edit)~|~translationMissing
Your enthusiasm is to be commended. Very well, if you feel you are already prepared then who am I to stop you.~|~translationMissing
As we've previously discussed, my brother is currently gathering strength in the lands west of here. The only known way into those lands is through the Underground Pass.~|~translationMissing
(Continues with Underground Pass dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
I think I should train some more.~|~translationMissing
My training ground is open to you if needed. Return to me when you are ready and we will discuss our next steps.~|~translationMissing
If the player has all the requirements for Underground Pass~|~translationMissing
Very well. Return to me once you are ready and we will discuss our next steps.~|~translationMissing
Good day King Lathas.~|~translationMissing
And to you adventurer. I assume you're here about King Tyras?~|~translationMissing
I am. What's our plan?~|~translationMissing
Well, as we've previously discussed, my brother is currently gathering strength in the lands west of here. The only known way into those lands is through the Underground Pass.~|~translationMissing
I'm just passing through.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Return to me when you are ready and we will discuss our next steps.~|~translationMissing
Hey, how are you?~|~translationMissing
Good thanks, yourself?~|~translationMissing
Not bad, did you speak to the king?~|~translationMissing
I did, he admitted the plague is a hoax.~|~translationMissing
Did he say why?~|~translationMissing
He did. He asked me to keep it a secret though.~|~translationMissing
Even from me?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid so. Don't worry though, I'm working with the king to resolve all of this.~|~translationMissing
I hope so. Even without the plague, I still worry about the people of West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
Not bad, I do wish you could tell me what's going on with the plague though.~|~translationMissing
So do I Elena. I promise I'll tell you everything once this is all over.~|~translationMissing
I hope that's not too far off.~|~translationMissing
It shouldn't be, don't worry.~|~translationMissing
Oh hello, I can't chat now. I have to keep an eye on my husband. He's very ill!~|~translationMissing

Sir Amik Varze~|~translationMissing
I am the leader of the White Knights of Falador. Why do you seek my audience?~|~translationMissing
I seek a quest!~|~translationMissing
I seek a quest.~|~translationMissing
Well, I need some spy work doing but it's quite dangerous. It will involve going into the Black Knights' fortress.~|~translationMissing
I laugh in the face of danger!~|~translationMissing
Well that's good. Don't get too overconfident though.~|~translationMissing
You've come along at just the right time actually. All of my knights are already known to the Black Knights.~|~translationMissing
Subtlety isn't exactly our strong point.~|~translationMissing
Can't you just take your White Knights' armour off? They wouldn't recognise you then!~|~translationMissing
I am afraid our charter prevents us using espionage in any form, that is the domain of the Temple Knights.~|~translationMissing
Temple Knights? Who are they?~|~translationMissing
That information is classified. I am forbidden to share it with outsiders.~|~translationMissing
So... what do you need doing?~|~translationMissing
Now, NORMALLY this wouldn't be a problem...~|~translationMissing
But they claim to have a powerful new secret weapon.~|~translationMissing
Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to infiltrate their fortress, find out what their secret weapon is, and then sabotage it.~|~translationMissing
Start the Black Knights' Fortress quest?~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll do my best.~|~translationMissing
Good luck! Let me know how you get on. Here's the dossier for the case, I've already given you the details.~|~translationMissing
Oh. You don't appear to have any room for the dossier in your inventory. Come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives dossier.)~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not ready to do that.~|~translationMissing
Come see me again if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
I go and cower in a corner at the first sign of danger!~|~translationMissing
Err....~|~translationMissing
Well.~|~translationMissing
I... suppose spy work DOES involve a little hiding in corners.~|~translationMissing
Oh. I suppose I'll give it a go then.~|~translationMissing
I don't, I'm just looking around.~|~translationMissing
Ok. Please don't break anything.~|~translationMissing
How's the mission going?~|~translationMissing
I haven't managed to find what the secret weapon is yet...~|~translationMissing
Well, keep at it! Falador's future is at stake!~|~translationMissing
If the player lost their dossier~|~translationMissing
Here's the dossier on the case.~|~translationMissing

You can't open this door.~|~translationMissing
Fortress Guard~|~translationMissing
Hey! You can't come in here! This is a high security military installation!~|~translationMissing
Yes, but I work here!~|~translationMissing
Well, this is the guards' entrance. I might be new here but I can tell you're not a guard.~|~translationMissing
You're not even wearing proper guards uniform!~|~translationMissing
Oh pleeeaaase let me in!~|~translationMissing
Go away. You're getting annoying.~|~translationMissing
So what is this uniform?~|~translationMissing
Well you can see me wearing it. It's an iron chainbody and a medium bronze helm.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... I wonder if I can make that or get some in the local towns....~|~translationMissing
What was that you muttered?~|~translationMissing
Oh, nothing important!~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry.~|~translationMissing
Don't let it happen again.~|~translationMissing
So who does it belong to?~|~translationMissing
This fortress belongs to the order of Black Knights known as the Kinshra.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Okay, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Get lost. This is private property.~|~translationMissing
Hey! Get back on duty!~|~translationMissing
Uh...~|~translationMissing
Black Knight~|~translationMissing
Die intruder!~|~translationMissing
You push against the wall. You find a secret passage.~|~translationMissing
Black Knight Captain~|~translationMissing
So... how's the secret weapon coming along?~|~translationMissing
The invincibility potion is almost ready...~|~translationMissing
It's taken me FIVE YEARS, but it's almost ready.~|~translationMissing
Greldo the Goblin here is just going to fetch the last ingredient for me.~|~translationMissing
It's a specially grown cabbage grown by my cousin Helda who lives in Draynor Manor.~|~translationMissing
The soil there is slightly magical and it gives the cabbages slight magical properties....~|~translationMissing
...not to merntion the trees!~|~translationMissing
Now remember Greldo, only a Draynor Manor cabbage will do! Don't get lazy and bring any old cabbage, THAT would ENTIRELY wreck the potion!~|~translationMissing
Greldo~|~translationMissing
Yeth, Mithreth.~|~translationMissing
I've found out what the Black Knight's secret weapon is. It's a potion of invincibility.~|~translationMissing
A potion of invincibility? That is grave news indeed. If you can sabotage it somehow, you will be very well paid.~|~translationMissing
So when I finish this mission for you can I be a white knight? Can I wear your armour too?~|~translationMissing
I am afraid I cannot authorise you to become a white knight unless under a situation of dire circumstance. Assisting us on a freelance basis will be well worth your time however and you will have my personal gratitude.~|~translationMissing
I can't buy stuff with personal gratitude though...~|~translationMissing
There is of course also the financial recompense as I said.~|~translationMissing
Ok! I'll get on to sabotaging that potion.~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. Those Black Knights are in an important meeting. They said they'd kill anyone who went in there!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I won't.~|~translationMissing
Wise move.~|~translationMissing
I don't care. I'm going in anyway.~|~translationMissing
Why exactly would I want to do that?~|~translationMissing
This is the wrong sort of cabbage!~|~translationMissing
I'm not supposed to be HELPING the witch you know...~|~translationMissing
The player throws the cabbage through the hole~|~translationMissing
Where has Greldo got to with that magic cabbage!~|~translationMissing
What's that noise?~|~translationMissing
Hopefully Greldo with the cabbage... yes, look here it co....NOOOOOoooo!~|~translationMissing
The cabbage falls through the hole in the ceiling and lands in the potion, destroying it.~|~translationMissing
My potion!~|~translationMissing
Oh boy, this doesn't look good!~|~translationMissing
Black Cat~|~translationMissing
Meow!~|~translationMissing
Looks like my work here is done. Seems like that's successfully sabotaged their little secret weapon plan.~|~translationMissing
It's RUINED! All that work, FIVE years down the drain, who was it! I'll find them and when I do....~|~translationMissing
Erm.. maybe we can save some of it?~|~translationMissing
SAVE some of it? Are you mad!? That cabbage was a normal cabbage, it spoilt the whole thing and now I have to start all over again!~|~translationMissing
No need to... get upset... you're scaring the cat.~|~translationMissing
'The CAT'? She's not 'THE CAT'!~|~translationMissing
She's Maemi... aren't you dear....~|~translationMissing
Purrr....~|~translationMissing
I have ruined the Black Knights' invincibility potion. That should put a stop to your problem and an end to their little schemes.~|~translationMissing
Yes, we have just received a message from the Black Knights saying they withdraw their demands, which would seem to confirm your story.~|~translationMissing
Now I believe there was some talk of a cash reward...~|~translationMissing
Absolutely right. Please accept this reward.~|~translationMissing
Sir Amik hands you 2500 coins.~|~translationMissing

Curator Haig Halen~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the museum of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Have you any interesting news?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the requirements to start the quest~|~translationMissing
Well, firstly you'll need to do a bit of work around the museum, then maybe we can talk.~|~translationMissing
Yes, we found a rather interesting island to the North of Morytania. We believe that it may be of archaeological significance.~|~translationMissing
Oh? That sounds interesting.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. We are making the final preparations for our voyage, in fact, you may be just the person we are looking for... Assuming you've got the necessary qualifications, that is.~|~translationMissing
Would I qualify then?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed The Dig Site~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, you haven't passed your Earth Science exams so you aren't qualified to help us on the dig. If you're interested, visit the Exam Centre on the Dig Site to the east and talk to the examiners there.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough Kudos~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, you haven't earned enough kudos yet to help us on the dig. If you're interested in helping us out and getting that Kudos, simply help out around the Museum. You can find out more at the information~|~translationMissing
booth.~|~translationMissing
Yes indeed. You've helped us a great deal around the Museum and you have the necessary qualifications from the Earth Sciences exams.~|~translationMissing
I have received word from the digsite that the canal has been constructed, and the barge is awaiting some final touches.~|~translationMissing
The site foreman requested the aid of a qualified and experienced adventurer, and I believe you would be a perfect fit for the role.~|~translationMissing
Sign me up!~|~translationMissing
That's great to hear. You should speak to the foreman at the digsite canal, I'll make sure he knows to expect you.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I'm far too busy right now.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, do let me know if you happen to change your mind.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you know where I could find any treasure?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How do I get a medallion?~|~translationMissing
Hello, the curator said you could use some assistance here?~|~translationMissing
Barge foreman~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, it's about time! We are in the final stages of preparation, there are a few minor adjustments I'd like to make to the barge before we get the crew ready.~|~translationMissing
What can I do to help?~|~translationMissing
Well, we've learned from our previous attempts that we need a sturdier type of wood to keep the barge afloat.~|~translationMissing
However, magic logs had... well... peculiar side effects.~|~translationMissing
Luckily, a new high-grade wood was discovered in distant Western lands, it would make the perfect material for the areas of the barge we need to reinforce.~|~translationMissing
So you'd like me to bring you some of this wood?~|~translationMissing
It's not quite that simple, I'm afraid. You'll have to talk to the sawmill operator at the Varrock sawmill to the North West, he will let you know what has to be done.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll talk to the sawmill operator.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, [player]. Have you retrieved the supplies yet?~|~translationMissing
Well we need them to reinforce the barge, the sawmill operator can tell you what you need to do if you're unsure.~|~translationMissing
Sawmill operator~|~translationMissing
Do you want me to make some planks for you? Or would you be interested in some other housing supplies?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Planks please!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What kind of planks can you make?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I buy some housing supplies?~|~translationMissing
I'm here on behalf of the museum archaeological team.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I was wondering when they would finally send over a member of the expedition.~|~translationMissing
So what do you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
None of the lumber here is appropriate for the task at hand, however, I've arranged a fairly generous deal between myself and the sawmill over in the Hosidius Woodcutting guild.~|~translationMissing
Sounds fairly straight forward.~|~translationMissing
That's good to hear. Once the document has been signed, bring it back to me and we'll get those supplies sent over to the foreman.~|~translationMissing
Okay, bye.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Nothing, thanks~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. You need to get those documents signed by the sawmill operator in the Woodcutting guild in Hosidius. If you lack the requirements to enter, a representative of the guild can sign it on the sawmill's behalf.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back with those signed documents.~|~translationMissing
I lost the trade proposal...~|~translationMissing
No worries, here's another copy.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the requirements to enter the Woodcutting Guild~|~translationMissing
Berry~|~translationMissing
Hello there, what business do you have with the Woodcutting guild?~|~translationMissing
I have a proposal for your guild's sawmill, it is from the Varrock sawmill.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, our sawmill operator was expecting you. Do you have the proposal with you?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have it here.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, hand it over and I'll sign it on behalf of the guild if everything looks in order.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the proposal to Berry, he glosses over it before signing and returning the document.~|~translationMissing
There you go, we'll ship the redwood planks over to Varrock sawmill immediately.~|~translationMissing
Redwood planks eh? Those would certainly make for an interesting building material...~|~translationMissing
Thanks, bye.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the requirements to enter the Woodcutting Guild~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the woodcutting guild, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to be doing with this document.~|~translationMissing
Everything has been signed, so you just need to take it back to the sawmill operator at the Varrock sawmill.~|~translationMissing
How can I help?~|~translationMissing
The sawmill operator in Varrock said you were in possession of some special planks?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, it was no easy feat, but I've managed to make some very high quality lumber out of the logs from the redwoods up there.~|~translationMissing
Redwood planks?~|~translationMissing
Precisely.~|~translationMissing
Could they be used to build anything else?~|~translationMissing
Well, it certainly makes for an interesting material, I can imagine it being used for all sorts in the future...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, do you have the proposed deal on you? The sooner we set up our agreement the sooner we can ship these materials.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the sawmill proposal~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have it on me right now.~|~translationMissing
Well you'll need to let me see the proposal before I can agree to anything.~|~translationMissing
Right, of course. I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the the sawmill proposal~|~translationMissing
Excellent, hand it over and I'll just make sure everything looks in order.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the proposal, the sawmill operator glances over it before signing and returning the document.~|~translationMissing
There you go. We'll ship the materials over to the Varrock sawmill immediately.~|~translationMissing
I lost the trade agreement...~|~translationMissing
Great, do you have the documents with you?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the trade agreement~|~translationMissing
I don't have it with me.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll need it before I can send over these supplies.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the trade agreement with them~|~translationMissing
You hand over the signed documents.~|~translationMissing
That all looks to be in order. I'll get those supplies to the foreman right away.~|~translationMissing
We're all done here, the foreman at the digsite should know what you need to do next.~|~translationMissing
The supplies arrived earlier, my men have reinforced the barge using those redwood planks. Thanks for your help, [player name].~|~translationMissing
No problem. Is there anything else you need?~|~translationMissing
The barge is prepared for the voyage, so I'm just about done here.~|~translationMissing
Now that the barge is ready, you should probably talk to the lead navigator on board.~|~translationMissing
There doesn't seem to be a gangplank... How am I meant to get on board?~|~translationMissing
The barge guard will happily help you on board. Just give him a prod!~|~translationMissing
Barge guard~|~translationMissing
Hello there, can I help you?~|~translationMissing
Can I go onto the barge?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely, the navigators are waiting for you on board!~|~translationMissing
No, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Lead Navigator~|~translationMissing
Hello, I'm the lead navigator on the expedition, I take it you're here to help us out?~|~translationMissing
Yep, that would be me.~|~translationMissing
Good, because we're going to need your help if we're ever going out on this voyage.~|~translationMissing
What's wrong?~|~translationMissing
Well, you may be aware of the previous attempts at this expedition?~|~translationMissing
No, what happened?~|~translationMissing
Well, the first barge had some serious design flaws... it didn't float.~|~translationMissing
The second barge suffered from 'feature creep'. Senior museum staff stuck their oar in and added unnecessary features~|~translationMissing
'go-faster stripes', a portable fossil centrifuge and a walk-on mini-museum.~|~translationMissing
Needless to say, it had... buoyancy issues.~|~translationMissing
The third barge made it out to sea, but a special sealant was used that attracted sea monsters. They didn't make it very far.~|~translationMissing
The fourth also used a special sealant, this one attracted icebergs.~|~translationMissing
The fifth barge crashed into the sixth.~|~translationMissing
We lost the seventh one.~|~translationMissing
The eighth barge is still here, we think. An accident involving a magical explosion and some talking anchovies means that it is now believed to reside 12 seconds out of phase.~|~translationMissing
The ninth version was built using magic logs. The barge gained some form of rudimentary sentience. It developed serious depression and ran itself aground near Crandor.~|~translationMissing
So, now do you understand why we need your help?~|~translationMissing
I'm aware, no need to tell me about them.~|~translationMissing
Um... Not really.~|~translationMissing
The voyage is clearly cursed!~|~translationMissing
Oh... right...~|~translationMissing
Well, [player name], whether you believe it or not, know that none of my men will be going on this expedition unless you can ensure our safety from the curse.~|~translationMissing
How am I supposed to do that?~|~translationMissing
We're not the first crew to face a cursed voyage, perhaps someone who has experienced one before can give you some advice.~|~translationMissing
Any idea where I'd be able to find someone like that?~|~translationMissing
I've heard all kinds of stories at the Rusty Anchor Inn in Port Sarim. I'm sure you'll be able to find out something about cursed voyages if you ask around the folks there.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll see what I can learn.~|~translationMissing
Maybe later.~|~translationMissing
Ahab~|~translationMissing
Arrr, matey!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm looking for Redbeard Frank.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you help me get to Crandor Island?~|~translationMissing
Ever made any cursed voyages?~|~translationMissing
Naarrr, can't say I have [laddie/lassie].~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Are you going to sit there all day?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you want to trade?~|~translationMissing
Longbow Ben~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Why are you called Longbow Ben?~|~translationMissing
(Continues below from Jack Seagull's "Aye! I've sailed many..."~|~translationMissing
Jack Seagull~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Aye! I've sailed many a treacherous journey in my time! What it be to ye?~|~translationMissing
I'm meant to be setting sail on a voyage of my own, but the crew won't go without some sort of 'protection'. I was hoping someone here would know of a way to avoid falling victim to the so-called curse.~|~translationMissing
There be nothing 'so-called' about curses [laddie/lassie]!~|~translationMissing
Aye, 'tis a matter we take very seriously in our profession. Luckily, there are ways ye can avoid a curse.~|~translationMissing
Great! What do I need to do?~|~translationMissing
Well that all depends on the nature of yer travels!~|~translationMissing
We are heading out on an expedition to an ancient, previously unexplored, island for Varrock museum.~|~translationMissing
The museum aye? Ye be diggin' up bones and them sorts then?~|~translationMissing
Well... I guess so.~|~translationMissing
Then the way I be seein' it, ye be needin' a lucky charm to do with that!~|~translationMissing
A lucky charm to do with digging up bones?~|~translationMissing
Aye! I hear folk talking of an odd old man up in the quarry near Paterdomus who sounds as if he might deal in those sorts of things.~|~translationMissing
Bahahahaha! This poor young [laddie/lassie] is sailing a cursed voyage and ye be suggestin' lucky charms?!~|~translationMissing
What ye be gettin' at, Ahab?~|~translationMissing
Listen here, [laddie/lassie]. There be no way out of a cursed voyage, however, there are ways one can make it through unscathed...~|~translationMissing
Aye, just like ye and yer leg, Ahab? Ahahaha!~|~translationMissing
Take no notice of him. I just thought it be worth ye knowing all the options is all.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps. What would I need to do to make it through the voyage 'unscathed'?~|~translationMissing
Folk be tellin' tales of a special potion... A 'potion of sealegs' they be callin' it.~|~translationMissing
A potion of sealegs?~|~translationMissing
Aye. The crew simply drink the potion before they be settin' sail, and the next thing they know, they be safely at their destination!~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Magical potions? Be soundin' like nonsense to me!~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess I'll talk to the navigators and offer both up to the crew to see which they'd prefer before I go gathering them up! Thanks guys!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you got any quests I could do?~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, [player name]. Any luck finding a way for us to make it through this cursed voyage?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've got two options, actually.~|~translationMissing
Interesting, let's hear them.~|~translationMissing
The first is to use a good luck charm, something related to our expedition - a lucky bone from an odd old man in Paterdomus.~|~translationMissing
The second is a potion of sealegs, the crew would have to drink it at the start of the voyage.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm certainly not putting my crew's life in the hands of some lucky charm! I think I'll go with the potion.~|~translationMissing
Junior Navigator~|~translationMissing
I think the lucky charm sounds like a good idea...~|~translationMissing
Oh quiet, boy - you shouldn't believe in such nonsense.~|~translationMissing
It's okay, I can get both.~|~translationMissing
Fine by me, as long as you get that potion.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, [mister/miss]!~|~translationMissing
The apothecary in Varrock might be able to help you out with that potion of sealegs, I'd start by paying him a visit.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back once I've got the potion of sealegs and the lucky charm.~|~translationMissing
Any luck getting your hands on that potion of sealegs?~|~translationMissing
The apothecary in Varrock might be able to help you out, you should pay him a visit.~|~translationMissing
Hey, have you managed to get me that lucky charm?~|~translationMissing
The old man up in Paterdomus collects those sort of things, I'd see if he's going anything he's willing to give up.~|~translationMissing
Apothecary~|~translationMissing
I am the Apothecary. I brew potions. Do you need anything specific?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you make potions for me?~|~translationMissing
Talk about something else.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you got any decent gossip to share?~|~translationMissing
Talk about Bone Voyage.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I'm looking for an unusual potion to get my crew through a 'cursed' voyage.~|~translationMissing
Aha! Don't tell me... You want a potion of sealegs?~|~translationMissing
Yes, actually. What's so funny?~|~translationMissing
You'd be amazed at the nonsense these pirates believe! I'll let you in on a little secret, there is no magical potion to save you from the sea's wrath!~|~translationMissing
Then what have you been giving those sailors?~|~translationMissing
A simple herbal remedy containing vodka. Lots of vodka.~|~translationMissing
Look, if you bring me the ingredients, I'll make you the potion. It's not going to save your crew from sea curses, of course, but it'll certainly put their fears to rest!~|~translationMissing
Well I don't really have a choice here, I need that potion. What ingredients do you need?~|~translationMissing
Two bottles of vodka and an unfinished marrentill potion, I already have everything else I require.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you got any good potions to give away?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No thanks.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the ingredients for the potion?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the ingredients~|~translationMissing
What were they?~|~translationMissing
You need to bring me 2 bottles of vodka and an unfinished marrentill potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the ingredients~|~translationMissing
Yep, I've got them here.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Hand them over and I'll mix the potion.~|~translationMissing
You hand the apothecary the ingredients. He adds a few herbs of his own before handing back the foul-smelling concoction.~|~translationMissing
I lost the potion of sealegs...~|~translationMissing
Lucky for you I made extra, try to be more careful this time!~|~translationMissing
The apothecary hands you another potion of sealegs.~|~translationMissing
How goes the expedition?~|~translationMissing
We haven't gone yet.~|~translationMissing
Oh! Well, good luck!~|~translationMissing
Talk about lucky charms.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I was told you might be able to help me get a lucky charm?~|~translationMissing
Odd Old Man~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes? I suppose I might have something like that laying around...~|~translationMissing
Sack~|~translationMissing
Mumblemumblemumble.~|~translationMissing
Why would you be looking for such an item?~|~translationMissing
I'm working with the museum.~|~translationMissing
Is that so...~|~translationMissing
Mumblemumble. Mumble.~|~translationMissing
Do you take me for a fool? As if someone working for the museum would be looking for something like that!~|~translationMissing
Actually, that's not what I meant...~|~translationMissing
Oh really... so what would it be then?~|~translationMissing
I'm making a cursed voyage.~|~translationMissing
I'm making a cursed voyage. We're heading to an island on an archaeological expedition.~|~translationMissing
Mumblemumble.~|~translationMissing
Interesting, yes, I may have something that could be of use...~|~translationMissing
That's great, what would you like for it?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely nothing! You can have it free of charge...~|~translationMissing
Just be sure to bring me back any interesting bones you find on that island.~|~translationMissing
Err... Sure.~|~translationMissing
The Odd Old Man hands you a small object made out of bone.~|~translationMissing
I'm a collector.~|~translationMissing
My collection is not up for grabs! Go find your own!~|~translationMissing
What would you like to do?~|~translationMissing
I lost the lucky charm you gave me...~|~translationMissing
Lucky for you I have another one here, try to be more careful this time!~|~translationMissing
Back already?~|~translationMissing
Did you find any for me on that expedition of yours?~|~translationMissing
Err... Not yet.~|~translationMissing
Well make sure you keep an eye out for anything particularly interesting!~|~translationMissing
Sure, bye.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I'm feeling luckier already!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I'm sure you are.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for getting me the lucky charm, [player name]. I'm feeling a lot better about the voyage already.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work, [player name]! I'm sure the crew will be very glad to hear about this.~|~translationMissing
Looks like we've got everything we need to set off!~|~translationMissing
We're ready to go when you are, [player name].~|~translationMissing
I'm ready, let's go.~|~translationMissing
Each member of the crew, apart from the junior navigator, take a sip of the potion of sealegs.~|~translationMissing
It doesn't take long for the potion to take effect, causing them to pass out.~|~translationMissing
What did your potion do to the crew?!~|~translationMissing
Well, the apothecary figured they can't be afraid if they're unconcious...~|~translationMissing
But then who's going to get us to the island?~|~translationMissing
Aren't you meant to be a navigator?~|~translationMissing
Yes, a JUNIOR navigator! I've never navigated open waters like this!~|~translationMissing
What are we going to do?~|~translationMissing
Okay... Let me think...~|~translationMissing
You'll need to operate the barge controls, I'll let you know if we're headed in the right direction.~|~translationMissing
You'll have to fight against the winds to keep the bearing North, you can do that by steering the barge.~|~translationMissing
You can increase or decrease our speed by adjusting the sails. You might find keeping the bearing North easier at slower speeds, but it will take longer to reach the island.~|~translationMissing
If we're headed in the wrong direction for too long I'll take us back to the digsite. Let me know if you want me to go back over these instructions at any point.~|~translationMissing
Okay, see you soon.~|~translationMissing
(Same as above from "Looks like we've got everything we need to set off!")~|~translationMissing
We were completely off course, [player name]. Talk to the lead navigator to try again.~|~translationMissing
Abort the voyage?~|~translationMissing
With the aid of the junior navigator, you sail back to the digsite.~|~translationMissing
Cancel.~|~translationMissing
You should talk to the lead navigator when you're ready to set sail.~|~translationMissing
My head... What happened? I thought we were going to set off on our voyage, [Player name]?~|~translationMissing
There were some... complications.~|~translationMissing
Well, are you ready to set off again? Let me know and I'll get the crew to take another dose of this potion of sealegs.~|~translationMissing
Good work, [player name], you got us here in one piece!~|~translationMissing
I suppose you'll want to start exploring the island as soon as possible.~|~translationMissing
Here, take this journal so you can keep track of your discoveries. Base camp is being set up on shore, let me know if you'd like to head there.~|~translationMissing

Mumblelandlubbermumblemumble...~|~translationMissing
Hello!~|~translationMissing
What right have ye to be so happy, landlubber?~|~translationMissing
Well it is quite a nice day.~|~translationMissing
Aye, that it is.~|~translationMissing
Will ye forgive an old sailor his temper [lad/lass]? I'm in dire straits indeed.~|~translationMissing
What's the problem? I may be able to help.~|~translationMissing
I dunno, [lad/lass], I need a pirate to help me with my problem, but none will sail with me.~|~translationMissing
Well, ye look like ye might have the right stuff, tell me would ye like te be a pirate?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've always wanted to be a pirate!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all quest requirements~|~translationMissing
It takes more grit than most have te be a pirate, and I don't think ye've got what it takes [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
You do not meet all of the requirements to start the Cabin Fever quest.~|~translationMissing
Well [lad/lass], I don't think ye could pirate yer way out of a chest full of piracy.~|~translationMissing
Awww...~|~translationMissing
But since nobody else will risk the trip ye'll do!~|~translationMissing
Well [lad/lass], I be Bill Teach, the Captain of the Adventurous, one of the finest ships ever to sail these waters.~|~translationMissing
I'm in port doin' some legitimate tradin' before headin' back to Mos Le'Harmless.~|~translationMissing
Mos Le'Harmless? Where is that?~|~translationMissing
It's a pirate stronghold off the southern coast of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Been in existence for years it has, the best place for pirates to relax with the exception of Brimhaven.~|~translationMissing
Would be THE best, but we don't have their fancy Agility Arena.~|~translationMissing
Will it be OK for me to go there if I am not a pirate?~|~translationMissing
Of course [lad/lass], once we make landfall ye'll have worked as a sailor on a pirate vessel, which is one of the easiest ways to become a true pirate.~|~translationMissing
This brings me back to the reason I'm stuck here of course, and the reason I need your help.~|~translationMissing
Last night I got into a war o' words with another Cap'n, and he has vowed to sink my ship and put all of my crew to the sword.~|~translationMissing
How horrible! How did your crew react?~|~translationMissing
By desertin'.~|~translationMissing
All of them?~|~translationMissing
Every last one!~|~translationMissing
The second I leave port I'll come under attack. I think I'll be able te make it if I have another person helpin' out, but I wouldn't stand a chance by me self.~|~translationMissing
Ye said ye would help me out [lad/lass], will ye stand by yer word?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I am a man of my word.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I am a [man/woman] of my word.~|~translationMissing
Arr! Ye struck me as a [man/woman] of integrity!~|~translationMissing
My ship is the Adventurous, and she's at the east dock.~|~translationMissing
You won't...err...I mean ye'll not regret it Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I won't.~|~translationMissing
No, if it's so dangerous your crew left, count me out.~|~translationMissing
Well, that doesn't surprise me much.~|~translationMissing
On yer way [lad/lass], leave me be.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, it sounds quite dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Aye, that it be. Come back when yer liver ain't so lily-like, [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
I don't think that whoever owns this ship will be happy with me wandering all over it.~|~translationMissing
Let me finish my drink, landlubber!~|~translationMissing
If ye ain't up te scratch as a pirate I may not get another one.~|~translationMissing
Aye aye Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Just remember, [he/she]'s all ye could get, Bill, and maybe ye'll get through it...~|~translationMissing
Ye came!~|~translationMissing
You seem rather surprised.~|~translationMissing
Well, I had the feelin' ye might have run off when ye realised how much of a task ye had ahead of ye.~|~translationMissing
Don't ye worry about me, Cap'n! I'm the scurviest, throat-cuttinest pirate to ever walk the mainplank! Arr!~|~translationMissing
Aye, I should have remembered ye was eager.~|~translationMissing
Ye all ready to go [lad/lass]?~|~translationMissing
Let's go Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Can I just go grab something?~|~translationMissing
Aye [lad/lass], take yer time, I'm not goin' anywhere without ye.~|~translationMissing
Ye all ready to go lad?~|~translationMissing
Well, it looks like they've found us Cap'n.~|~translationMissing
Ye don't say [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
Well, without anyone else te help ye'll have te do some hard work if we don't want to end up walkin' home on the sea bed.~|~translationMissing
What will you be doing?~|~translationMissing
Well if their first shot hadn't taken out the cannon I'd be firing that at them.~|~translationMissing
Arr! They seek te hole the ship! Go and take care of their cannon.~|~translationMissing
If ye grab some fuse from the gun locker, and a rope from the repair locker, then ye can use the rope on the sails to swing over and deal with their cannon.~|~translationMissing
Just take the fuse, use it on the barrel of gunpowder next to the cannon, and then light it with something.~|~translationMissing
A lantern, a tinderbox, it doesn't matter.~|~translationMissing
End of problem.~|~translationMissing
How do I get back?~|~translationMissing
They have masts as well don't they?~|~translationMissing
Just do the same trick using some rope on their sails and swing over.~|~translationMissing
Arr! I'll hop to it Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Stop doin' that!~|~translationMissing
Ye ain't a pirate yet by a long shot!~|~translationMissing
I'll be on deck if ye need me.~|~translationMissing
Now to take care of that cannon!~|~translationMissing
Urgent as this looks, if I haven't taken out that cannon they will just hole the ship again.~|~translationMissing
Just to clear everything up, what is it you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
Well, ye'll need to silence their cannon before it sinks us. Before ye do that though, ye'll need to swing over to their ship.~|~translationMissing
How do I make a rope swing?~|~translationMissing
Yer not much of a pirate are ye lad?~|~translationMissing
Ye climb up the mast and use a rope on the sails up there.~|~translationMissing
Then ye climb down and ye swing on the rope.~|~translationMissing
If I have te explain how ye do THAT then I might as well just send out some biscuit weevles to do the job instead.~|~translationMissing
Aye aye Cap'n! One rope swing coming right up!~|~translationMissing
Egad...~|~translationMissing
How can I blow up their cannon?~|~translationMissing
Well, ye'll need some fuse from the cannon locker below decks.~|~translationMissing
Swing over to the enemy ship and put the fuse in the barrel of gunpowder they'll have next to the cannon to speed up their firin'.~|~translationMissing
Then, use something on the fuse te get it lit.  A tinderbox, candle or any sort of flame will do.~|~translationMissing
After that ye just step back and let it burn by its self.~|~translationMissing
Arr! I'll blow that cannon sky high, sez I!~|~translationMissing
Give me strength...~|~translationMissing
Err, Cap'n, can we go back to port?~|~translationMissing
Go back?~|~translationMissing
Got a little scared now have we?~|~translationMissing
It's not that, I just need to grab something from the bank, that's all...~|~translationMissing
A likely story.~|~translationMissing
Are ye sure ye can't get by without it?~|~translationMissing
No, I need to go back now.~|~translationMissing
I thought as much.~|~translationMissing
(The screen fades to black. The player returns to Port Phasmatys.)~|~translationMissing
You return to port.~|~translationMissing
I'll try...~|~translationMissing
That's the spirit!~|~translationMissing
Well, as much as this is an interestin' break, why don't ye head back to the ship and we'll see if we can beat them this time?~|~translationMissing
Stop sayin' that!~|~translationMissing
All right, lad let's try this again. This time, try not te run away!~|~translationMissing
One look at the enemy and ye run away.~|~translationMissing
Get over there and take out their cannon before I throw ye there me self.~|~translationMissing
Pirate~|~translationMissing
Kill the squid-lovin' dog!~|~translationMissing
I'll have ye guts fer garters!~|~translationMissing
Kill the landlubber!~|~translationMissing
Get off my ship!~|~translationMissing
Te Davy-Jones locker with ye!~|~translationMissing
Fancy a crumpet?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I mean...~|~translationMissing
Arr! Run him through sez I!~|~translationMissing
I'm gonna kill ye!~|~translationMissing
Prepare te die!~|~translationMissing
I don't have time to search that.~|~translationMissing
The rope falls off the mast! Clearly your knots are sub-sailor standard.~|~translationMissing
You fall in the water with a splash!~|~translationMissing
(player's run energy is drained)~|~translationMissing
You attach the fuse to the barrel.~|~translationMissing
You are a little too close. Try lighting the end of the fuse.~|~translationMissing
The fuse refuses to light. Try again.~|~translationMissing
You light the fuse...~|~translationMissing
...and destroy the barrel and the cannon.~|~translationMissing
(The barrel blows up, taking out the cannon in the process.)~|~translationMissing
Arr! I've blown their cannon to smithereens Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Yer not a pirate yet [lad/lass], so stop talkin' like that!~|~translationMissing
Well, ye've sorted out their cannon, but we're takin' on water.~|~translationMissing
Go below deck and sort out the leaks.~|~translationMissing
Will smearing swamp paste on the holes do?~|~translationMissing
No [lad/lass], these holes were made by cannon fire.~|~translationMissing
Ye'll need to get some planks from the repair locker and tack them in place. Then ye smear swamp paste over the planks to seal the hole.~|~translationMissing
Arr! I'll have this ship ship-shape in no time! Arr!~|~translationMissing
Wait 'till we make landfall before ye start actin' like a pirate!~|~translationMissing
Errr...I may well have been caught up in the whole 'pirate' thing, and I can't seem to remember what I need to do now...~|~translationMissing
Zounds...~|~translationMissing
Pay attention!~|~translationMissing
Arr! I be rememberin' now Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
This is what I get when I ask random strangers for help...~|~translationMissing
Looks like they haven't been back to port to get that cannon fixed, which is lucky.~|~translationMissing
Get below and fix the holes in the hull pronto, or we'll sink before they have a chance te kill us!~|~translationMissing
You need 2 repair planks to repair this hole.~|~translationMissing
You need 10 tacks to repair this hole.~|~translationMissing
You need a Hammer to repair this hole.~|~translationMissing
You nail the Planks over the the hole!~|~translationMissing
You need Swamp Paste to waterproof this hole.~|~translationMissing
You smear the Swamp Paste over the hole!~|~translationMissing
The holes be plugged Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Nailed shut and waterproofed?~|~translationMissing
Aye!~|~translationMissing
Good work [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
Why not pay them a visit and go plunder their hold?~|~translationMissing
Arr! I'll plunder their booty and no mistake!~|~translationMissing
Gadzooks...~|~translationMissing
Come back here and drop it in the chest in the hold.~|~translationMissing
Aye aye Cap'n! One plunderin' comin' right up!~|~translationMissing
I've been a pirate all me life and I've never heard anyone keep harpin' on like that!~|~translationMissing
Stop it!~|~translationMissing
So...how many loads of plunder did you want me to get?~|~translationMissing
Ten! Can't ye count that high?~|~translationMissing
Of course I can!~|~translationMissing
What happens if I take all the plunder I find and there is less than ten loads?~|~translationMissing
Then ye wait for the pirates to stash some more in the hold. Since they are under attack they'll be dumpin' their gold and stuff in there every chance they get.~|~translationMissing
Just give it a minute and head back!~|~translationMissing
Arr! I'll keep plunderin' till the hold be full of booty!~|~translationMissing
Yer not making any friends here [lad/lass], just go and do it.~|~translationMissing
When yer quite done runnin' away lad ye've got a load of plunder to be grabbin'!~|~translationMissing
If the player has recently plundered the chest~|~translationMissing
This chest has been recently plundered.~|~translationMissing
You find some plunder!~|~translationMissing
(The player finds 3 loads of plunder.)~|~translationMissing
If the player has recently looted the crate~|~translationMissing
This crate has been recently looted.~|~translationMissing
(The player finds two loads of plunder.)~|~translationMissing
If the player has recently ransacked the barrel~|~translationMissing
This barrel has been recently ransacked.~|~translationMissing
(The player finds one load of plunder.)~|~translationMissing
If the player has no plunder to store~|~translationMissing
You have plunder to deposit.~|~translationMissing
You deposit [X] loads of plunder in the chest.~|~translationMissing
You deposit as much plunder as you can.~|~translationMissing
If the storage is filled with 10 plunder~|~translationMissing
This chest is full of plunder.~|~translationMissing
This chest has [X] loads of plunder inside.~|~translationMissing
I seem to have taken all the plunder.~|~translationMissing
I warn ye, [lad/lass], if the first word out of yer mouth is 'Arr' I'll be wearing yer spleen as a novelty hat before ye reach the second 'r'!~|~translationMissing
Ahoy shipmate!~|~translationMissing
I should have seen that comin'~|~translationMissing
Cap'n! I've put ten loads of plunder in the chest, in the hold!~|~translationMissing
If the player has extra plunder on them~|~translationMissing
I even had some left over!~|~translationMissing
Let me see that.~|~translationMissing
Can I have those back?~|~translationMissing
Have what back?~|~translationMissing
Are we all done now?~|~translationMissing
Not yet! Let's give em a blast with the cannon before we leave!~|~translationMissing
How, the cannon is broken.~|~translationMissing
Alright [lad/lass], try and stay with me on this one.~|~translationMissing
See, there is a secret technique for making things that be broken right again.~|~translationMissing
We call this magical process...repairin'.~|~translationMissing
I know what repairing is!~|~translationMissing
How do I repair the cannon?~|~translationMissing
Ye need to remove the old barrel, then replace it with a new one from the gun locker downstairs.~|~translationMissing
And then what?~|~translationMissing
I don't want to overload ye with too many details right now. Come tell me when the cannon is ready again.~|~translationMissing
What was I doing again?~|~translationMissing
If ye know what is good for ye, yer off to fix the cannon!~|~translationMissing
How was I going to do that again?~|~translationMissing
By replacing the broken barrel with a new one! Hop to it [lad/lass], the salt air is clearly eatin' into yer brains!~|~translationMissing
Have ye sorted out the cannon yet?~|~translationMissing
Then hop to it lad!~|~translationMissing
You take a cannon barrel.~|~translationMissing
You don't need [a Ramrod/a cannon ball/a canister/any Fuse] right now.~|~translationMissing
You attach the new barrel to the cannon.~|~translationMissing
You inspect the cannon...~|~translationMissing
Overall everything seems fine.~|~translationMissing
Cap'n I...~|~translationMissing
Have ye fixed the cannon yet, yes or no.~|~translationMissing
Ye did? Great!~|~translationMissing
Now ye can give those pirates a good shot across their bows.~|~translationMissing
Ye'll need to load the cannon, and if ye get it wrong the barrel will blow, and ye'll need to start again.~|~translationMissing
First, ye take some powder from the powder keg.~|~translationMissing
Then ye use a ramrod from the gun locker on the powder to tamp the charge.~|~translationMissing
Then ye use a canister round on the cannon.~|~translationMissing
Finally ye use some fuse on the cannon, and light it like ye did the fuse on the barrel earlier.~|~translationMissing
Then, ye'll need to use the ramrod on the cannon to clean it out for the next shot.~|~translationMissing
Ye got all that?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but if I forget I'll come and ask you.~|~translationMissing
And te think this was all I could get te help...~|~translationMissing
I can guess from the lack of an explosion that ye haven't fired the cannon yet, correct?~|~translationMissing
Well, not as such no.~|~translationMissing
And I'll bet ye want a quick recap of how to do it, correct?~|~translationMissing
That would help to be honest.~|~translationMissing
Ye got all that this time?~|~translationMissing
Aye Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Yer still not a pirate, so cut that out!~|~translationMissing
We were on the home stretch lad why did we turn back?~|~translationMissing
Never mind, just go shoot the pirates and let's press on.~|~translationMissing
You pour the powder into the cannon.~|~translationMissing
You shove the Ramrod into the cannon barrel.~|~translationMissing
You roll the canister round into the cannon.~|~translationMissing
You ready the cannon for firing.~|~translationMissing
The cannon blows up!~|~translationMissing
(The player takes 5 damage and the barrel is destroyed.)~|~translationMissing
You fire the cannon at the crew!~|~translationMissing
If the player hits the enemy~|~translationMissing
You hit them!~|~translationMissing
(The enemy takes 52 damage and dies.)~|~translationMissing
If the player misses the enemy~|~translationMissing
You missed!~|~translationMissing
Try waiting for there to be pirates in front of the cannon next time you fire!~|~translationMissing
Well, that seems to have showed them Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Great! This ordeal will soon be over!~|~translationMissing
Aye Cap'n, we'll beat these pirates yet!~|~translationMissing
Pirates?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that ordeal too!~|~translationMissing
Now [lad/lass], we'll send them to the bottom of the sea.~|~translationMissing
Well, ye'll shoot holes in their hull with the cannon.~|~translationMissing
Essentially ye do what ye just did, but use a cannonball from the gun locker in the hold instead of the canister rounds.~|~translationMissing
Arr! I'll sink them scurvy dogs!~|~translationMissing
Again with the 'Arr!'...~|~translationMissing
Give it three tries and see if they sink, that many holes should do it.~|~translationMissing
Cap'n, I know I need to load and fire the cannon at the enemy ship...~|~translationMissing
Aye [lad/lass]?~|~translationMissing
and I know I do this by adding powder to the cannon, tamping the charge with a ramrod, adding a cannonball, adding some fuse and then lighting it...~|~translationMissing
And I also remembered your warning about cleaning the barrel after every shot to avoid the cannon exploding...~|~translationMissing
But I've forgotten how many times I'm supposed to shoot the enemy ship...~|~translationMissing
Three! Three times [lad/lass]! Three! One more than two, one less than four! Got it!~|~translationMissing
There is no need to shout...~|~translationMissing
Were almost there! Just hole their hull and we'll be able to make it past. Get to it!~|~translationMissing
You shoot the cannon ball at the enemy ship!~|~translationMissing
If the player hits their shot~|~translationMissing
You put a hole in the hull!~|~translationMissing
If the player misses their shot~|~translationMissing
You fail to damage the hull.~|~translationMissing
You put another hole in the hull!~|~translationMissing
(End-game cutscene begins.)~|~translationMissing
Ye've done it [lad/lass]! They're sunk now!~|~translationMissing
Let's head to the island!~|~translationMissing
Mama~|~translationMissing
Bill? You look like you've been to Davey Jones' locker and back.~|~translationMissing
Oh, Miss La'Fiette, if only I were that lucky.~|~translationMissing
My crew deserted and I was stuck with an adventurer mannin' me ship.~|~translationMissing
[He/She] was as piratical as a bunch of Dwellberries...~|~translationMissing
I am still here you know...~|~translationMissing
Aye [lad/lass], I remember.~|~translationMissing
I'll leave you two alone.~|~translationMissing
All right...~|~translationMissing
Ok [player name], yer now a pirate, but...~|~translationMissing
Arr!~|~translationMissing
BUT ye can't just go around talking like some pirate in a fancy play.~|~translationMissing
No self-respectin' pirate says 'Arr' that much!~|~translationMissing
Well, except for Fancy Dan, but that be another story.~|~translationMissing
Here, have this book. It'll learn ye how to be a pirate.~|~translationMissing
Or at least learn ye te talk proper like one.~|~translationMissing
So all I have to do is read this book and I'm a pirate?~|~translationMissing
Aye...that be all ye need te do.~|~translationMissing
Ye'll need that book if ye want te trade with some of the pirates round here.~|~translationMissing
Outsiders tend not te understand them if ye catch me drift.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'd have been shark bait without ye.~|~translationMissing
If ye get a moment come see me fer yer share of the loot.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure as soon as ye stop yellin' 'Arr!' ye'll make a great pirate.~|~translationMissing
Thanks [player name]. If ye need a lift back, just come see me.~|~translationMissing
Can I have that gold now?~|~translationMissing
Sure ye can. Here.~|~translationMissing

7.1 Talking to Veos again after receiving the orb~|~translationMissing
8 Activating the orb~|~translationMissing
8.1 Using the "Activate" option on the mysterious orb by the Dark Altar~|~translationMissing
8.1.1 Trying to activate the orb in a different location~|~translationMissing
9 Finishing up~|~translationMissing
Veos~|~translationMissing
Hello again, [player name]! What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Where am I exactly?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you take me back to Port Sarim please?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Could you give me some advice on Kourend?~|~translationMissing
Have you got any quests for me?~|~translationMissing
As a matter of fact, [player name], I do...~|~translationMissing
I have a client from the mainland who's interested in learning a bit more about Kourend. They've asked me to gather some information on the five cities for them.~|~translationMissing
I was just going to do it myself, but as you're quite new around here, this might be a good opportunity for you to get to know the kingdom a bit better.~|~translationMissing
Sounds interesting! How can I help?~|~translationMissing
Veos hands you an enchanted scroll.~|~translationMissing
Take this scroll.~|~translationMissing
That scroll is special. When written on with a particular type of quill, my client will see what you're writing without anything being seen on the scroll itself.~|~translationMissing
Wait, wait! I'm not spying for somebody am I?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly... My client simply wishes to keep their 'knowledge gathering' on the down low.~|~translationMissing
That seems fair. Who should I speak to in order to find out more about the cities?~|~translationMissing
There's many a man and woman who could give you the information you need, but general store owners in each city will likely be your best bet.~|~translationMissing
They should know enough about their cities, and always seem up for a chat.~|~translationMissing
Good call. What about this special quill you mentioned?~|~translationMissing
Simply touching a normal feather onto the paper should synchronise their magical ability to work together. You don't need any ink.~|~translationMissing
Right, I'll return to you when I have the information your client needs.~|~translationMissing
See you soon.~|~translationMissing
I'm busy at the moment, actually. Not now.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Do come back if you wish to help out my client.~|~translationMissing
You attune the feather to the enchanted scroll, creating an enchanted quill.~|~translationMissing
Player receives an enchanted quill.~|~translationMissing
You already have an enchanted quill in your backpack. There's no need to make another.~|~translationMissing
Let's talk about your client...~|~translationMissing
What am I meant to be doing, again?~|~translationMissing
(Continues from "My client is interested"~|~translationMissing
I've lost something you've given me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost/banked the scroll but doesn't have inventory space~|~translationMissing
I'll be happy to provide you with another scroll, [player name], though I'm afraid you don't seem to have any room in your backpack! Return to me when you have.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost/banked the scroll~|~translationMissing
Veos hands you back an enchanted scroll.~|~translationMissing
Worry not, [player], I have many of those scrolls. Lucklily, due to the way it works, you haven't lost any information on it!~|~translationMissing
Remember, if you still need to create a quill, simply attune a feather by using it on the scroll.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, Veos!~|~translationMissing
If the player has the scroll in their backpack~|~translationMissing
You already have your scroll, [player], I can literally see it peeking out of your backpack...~|~translationMissing
Regath~|~translationMissing
What do you require, traveller? I deal in many things.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I don't need anything.~|~translationMissing
Can I ask you about Arceuus?~|~translationMissing
This city holds knowledge many would deem unsafe to share. Why should I be so trusting to you?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm a...~|~translationMissing
Uhm...~|~translationMissing
A journalist! Yes, a journalist from the mainland. I want to let the wider world know of how this incredible city works.~|~translationMissing
Someone willing to share knowledge of our great city to many others?~|~translationMissing
Very well, then. The rest of the world could certainly do with learning about our great library.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an enchanted quill~|~translationMissing
I was hoping to write this all down but I don't have the correct equipment! I'll be back in a tick!~|~translationMissing
You're not a very good journalist if you forget your equipment. Very well, then. I'll await your return.~|~translationMissing
If the player has an enchanted quill~|~translationMissing
So what exactly is it the people Arceuus bring to Great Kourend?~|~translationMissing
Arceuus is filled with literary and magical scholars. Lead by the great Trobin Arceuus. As a leader, he assists in pushing the limit of our knowledge surrounding magical abilities, souls and the crafting of runic energy.~|~translationMissing
He cares not for petty control, focusing instead on the expansion of knowledge within Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
How do people start gaining favour in Arceuus?~|~translationMissing
Those seeking favour within our city start with a particularly labour intensive job.~|~translationMissing
Our library, as grand as it is, still requires maintenance... constantly.~|~translationMissing
Why should I gain favour with Arceuus?~|~translationMissing
Through its power, we have great knowledge on life and death. This knowledge could be yours as well.~|~translationMissing
Your quill and scroll glow, causing a seething pain to run through your hand and arm.~|~translationMissing
What is the matter, journalist?~|~translationMissing
I... I don't know.~|~translationMissing
Very well. As mentioned, rewards for loyalty within our city are priceless. The sharing of our magical research is but child's play to the knowledge we share to the most loyal.~|~translationMissing
The knowledge of Blood and Soul runecrafting.~|~translationMissing
If Regath was not the last general store owner you talked to~|~translationMissing
You jot down all of the information Regath had to say about Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
If Regath was the last general store owner you talked to~|~translationMissing
As you jot down the final information on Arceuus, you hear a mysterious whisper in your ear. 'Return to Veos...'~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help, Regath!~|~translationMissing
You're welcome. Spread the word of this great city with the new knowledge you have gained, and perhaps be more careful with how you hold your scroll in the future...~|~translationMissing
Welcome to my shop. Would you like to buy or sell something?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Okay, let's trade~|~translationMissing
Can I ask you about Hosidius?~|~translationMissing
Well, well my friend! I've lived in this great and glorious city all of my life. I'd be happy to share with you anything you'd like to know!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I'm sorry. I was hoping to write this all down but I don't have the correct equipment! Can you hold that thought?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely. I'm always up for a chat with any of my new patrons!~|~translationMissing
What is it that Hosidius provides for Great Kourend?~|~translationMissing
Hosidius is filled with keen and skilled farmers alike! Lead by the incredibly efficient Kandur Hosidius, his intelligent resourcefulness ensures optimal agricultural production.~|~translationMissing
Our fields stretch as far as the eye can see. With incredible teamwork and group efforts, the ability to provide Great Kourend's people with food and herbal supplies is quite literally the fruits of our labour.~|~translationMissing
How do people start gaining favour in Hosidius?~|~translationMissing
Not into your back-breaking field maintenance or fertiliser creation? Those wishing to gain favour within our city may need to maintain such tediousness for a small while, though stick to it.~|~translationMissing
The rewards for that painful work are nothing short of great!~|~translationMissing
Why should I gain favour with Hosidius?~|~translationMissing
Access to our personal kitchens, Spirit Tree patch and Allotment space is lovely. That being said, our vinery and Tithe farm are world class and exclusive to only the most loyal.~|~translationMissing
You jot down all of the information Horace had to say about Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
If Horace was the last general store owner you talked to~|~translationMissing
As you jot down the final information on Hosidius, you hear a mysterious whisper in your ear. 'Return to Veos...'~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help, Horace!~|~translationMissing
Anytime, friend! Feel free to pop along if you ever need any wares!~|~translationMissing
Munty~|~translationMissing
Can I help you, human?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Let's trade.~|~translationMissing
Can I ask you about Lovakengj?~|~translationMissing
Why I'd be happy to have a chat! I do enjoy talking about this great city of ours.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, excuse me, I was hoping to write this all down but I don't have the correct equipment! I'll be back in a tick!~|~translationMissing
Very well, I look forward to chatting with you!~|~translationMissing
What is it that Lovakengj provides for Great Kourend?~|~translationMissing
Lovakengj is filled with incredibly skilled blacksmiths. Under the leadership of Vulcana Lovakengj, our intelligent material saving skills make us the finest blacksmiths in the land.~|~translationMissing
Armours, weaponry, tools and structures - our city supplies Kourend with all of these to the finest standards known to Dwarf and Human alike.~|~translationMissing
How do people start gaining favour in Lovakengj?~|~translationMissing
Those seeking favour within Lovakengj start with a dirty job.~|~translationMissing
Creating dynamite and mining in the sulphur mine isn't a pretty job, but someone has to do it!~|~translationMissing
Why should I gain favour with Lovakengj?~|~translationMissing
Those who endure our daunting introductory tasks are rewarded greatly - being taught to create the armour worn by the very soldiers of the Shayzien Army, along with access to our Blast Mine.~|~translationMissing
The rewards able to be reaped by the most loyal of our city are nothing to be scoffed at!~|~translationMissing
You jot down all of the information Munty had to say about Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
As you jot down the final information on Lovakengj, you hear a mysterious whisper in your ear. 'Return to Veos...'~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help, Munty!~|~translationMissing
Anytime! Come back soon!~|~translationMissing
Leenz~|~translationMissing
A great adventurer, from afar? How may I help with my repertoire?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I don't need anything right now.~|~translationMissing
Can I ask you about Port Piscarilius?~|~translationMissing
If it's Piscarilius information you seek, it's in my brain that you must peek!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I was hoping to write this all down but I don't have the correct equipment! Can you hold that rhyme?~|~translationMissing
If there's one thing, that I do best, it's waiting patiently, for my guests!~|~translationMissing
What is it that Port Piscarilius provides for Kourend?~|~translationMissing
You're certainly a chirpy woman! What is it that Port Piscarilius provides for Great Kourend?~|~translationMissing
Within Port Piscarilius, you'll find, great fisherman, traders, pirates and I. All lead, by our ruthless leader, Shauna Piscarilius, none yet to supersede her.~|~translationMissing
No surprise if you meet her, her tactics are ruthless. Her demeanour renders, all pirates toothless.~|~translationMissing
Our great shore and trading, have treasures to be found, providing export and fish, in quantities abound.~|~translationMissing
How do people start gaining favour in Port Piscarilius?~|~translationMissing
Repairing net cranes, and gathering bait, newcomers to the port, well this is their fate... It's labour intensive, and dirty work, though stick to it friend, 'till your arms are inert.~|~translationMissing
Why should I gain favour with Port Piscarilius?~|~translationMissing
If Leenz was not the last general store owner you talked to~|~translationMissing
You jot down all of the information Leenz had to say about Port Piscarilius... With slightly less poetry.~|~translationMissing
If Leenz was the last general store owner you talked to~|~translationMissing
As you jot down the final information on Port Piscarilius, you hear a mysterious whisper in your ear. 'Return to Veos...'~|~translationMissing
Hang on a second... that last one didn't rhyme too well!~|~translationMissing
Listen here pal, you don't mess with people in Port Piscarilius. Do you want happy rhyming Leenz, or angry, gruff and pain-inflicting Leenz?~|~translationMissing
Happy rhyming Leenz, please! Thanks for your help!~|~translationMissing
Anytime, my adventuring friend, enjoy your time in Great Kourend!~|~translationMissing
Jennifer~|~translationMissing
What're yer looking for, me luv'?~|~translationMissing
Can I ask you about Shayzien?~|~translationMissing
Well I could give you some info if that's all yer wantin'. Gets lonely in 'ere while me mates are out there fightin' the good war!~|~translationMissing
Apologies, I was hoping to write this all down but I don't have the correct equipment!~|~translationMissing
Well ye canne remember everything I 'ave to say about this wee 'ouse without that, can you? Come back when yer 'ead's not all fried!~|~translationMissing
What is it that Shayzien provides for Great Kourend?~|~translationMissing
Phwoar, what don' we do? This 'ouse is filled with officers and the like. Lead by our rig'rous leader Shiro Shayzien, 'e ensures ultimate justice and safety for the entirety of Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Our soldiers fight off the constant threat of the lizardman, while our 'ighly trained medics 'eal them from battle. Strict in combat trainin' and discipline. Law, order and defence. These are the words we live by!~|~translationMissing
How do people start gaining favour in Shayzien?~|~translationMissing
Don't get us wrong, me luv', it ain't all pretty. Those who're lookin' to gain favour within this city need to 'elp in 'ealing our fallen soldiers and tackling organised crime... It's 'ard work!~|~translationMissing
Why should I gain favour with Shayzien?~|~translationMissing
The rewards for the most loyal of this city are great. The 'onour to train alongside our elite guards and wear our prestigious armour, while also fightin' on the front line against the lizardman forces.~|~translationMissing
The spoils of wars are grand.~|~translationMissing
You jot down all of the information Jennifer had to say about Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
As you jot down the final information on Shayzien, you hear a mysterious whisper in your ear. 'Return to Veos...'~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help, Jennifer!~|~translationMissing
That's alright petal, you go'un and have fun.~|~translationMissing
I have gathered information from all of the cities.~|~translationMissing
I could hear a voice, Veos... in my head! As if it whispered in my ear to return to you!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I heard it too... they mentioned that your task was complete.~|~translationMissing
Let me take those items off your hands.~|~translationMissing
Veos removes the items he gave you from your backpack.~|~translationMissing
That reminds me, Veos! I didn't sign up to this! I wasn't told that my mind would be entered. And what about the possibility of severely damaging my hand?~|~translationMissing
If it makes you feel any better, my client sends their apologies. It wasn't intentional. Needless to say, something you said provoked emotion...~|~translationMissing
Namely...~|~translationMissing
The Dark Altar...~|~translationMissing
If I knew mentioning the Dark Altar would upset them so much, I'd have not written that bit of information down!~|~translationMissing
Well that's just the thing, [player name]. My client is pleased you found such information. Tell me... Would you be willing to do one last thing for them?~|~translationMissing
Well, I don't necessarily believe I have much of a choice!~|~translationMissing
What should I do now?~|~translationMissing
I'm certainly glad you're able to assist once again.~|~translationMissing
My client will be most pleased.~|~translationMissing
My client requires... another simple task. They assure me that it will be the last. Take this orb. You must activate it beside the Dark Altar, north of Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Player receives a mysterious orb.~|~translationMissing
Can I ask why I would do that?~|~translationMissing
It's best you don't.~|~translationMissing
Well, can't argue with that! I'll return when I'm done!~|~translationMissing
So what exactly is it your client now wants me to do?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the mysterious orb~|~translationMissing
Veos hands you an enchanted orb.~|~translationMissing
Take this orb.~|~translationMissing
(Same as above from "My client requires...")~|~translationMissing
If the player has the orb in their backpack~|~translationMissing
You already have the orb, [player name], I can literally see it peeking out of your backpack...~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost/banked the orb but doesn't have inventory space~|~translationMissing
I'll be happy to provide you with another orb, [player name], though I'm afraid you don't seem to have any room in your backpack! Return to me when you have room.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost/banked the orb~|~translationMissing
Veos hands you another mysterious orb.~|~translationMissing
Please be more careful, [player name]. Remember to return to me when you have used the orb in the area.~|~translationMissing
Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
The orb shatters after being held in the air.~|~translationMissing
You hear a whisper in your ear. 'Return... to Veos. My thanks...'~|~translationMissing
I really wish I would be warned about these things earlier...~|~translationMissing
The orb doesn't seem to respond here. Try moving closer to the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
Veos, enough is enough! I've suffered through enough. Exploding orbs and burning quills...~|~translationMissing
[player name]? What are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
You know darn well what I'm talking about!~|~translationMissing
[player name], I haven't spoken with you since bringing you to Kourend, I have no idea what you're on ab--~|~translationMissing
ARGH!~|~translationMissing
Veos, this isn't funny anymore... Are you alright? I did all that your client asked of me...~|~translationMissing
Veos' Client~|~translationMissing
Indeed you have.~|~translationMissing
Uhm... Veos?~|~translationMissing
You have done well. For that, you have my thanks.~|~translationMissing
Who are you? What have you done with Veos?~|~translationMissing
You need not fear for him. I will ensure no harm comes his way.~|~translationMissing
As for who I am... Well, that is of no importance.~|~translationMissing

Knowledge can be a curse. Sometimes, it is better to remain unaware.~|~translationMissing

Brother Kojo~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer. My name is Brother Kojo. Do you happen to know the time?~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, I don't.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! This clock tower has recently broken down, and without it nobody can tell the correct time. I must fix it before the town people become too angry!~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you could assist me in the repairs? I'll pay you for your help.~|~translationMissing
OK old monk, what can I do?~|~translationMissing
Oh, thank you kind sir! In the cellar below, you'll find four cogs. They're too heavy for me, but you should be able to carry them one at a time.~|~translationMissing
I know one goes on each floor... but I can't exactly remember which goes where specifically. Oh well, I'm sure you can figure it out fairly easily.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll do my best.~|~translationMissing
Thank you again! And remember to be careful, the cellar is full of strange beasts!~|~translationMissing
How much reward are we talking?~|~translationMissing
So... how much reward are we talking then?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm only a monk so I'm not exactly rich, but I assure you I will give you a fair reward for the time spent assisting me in repairing the clock.~|~translationMissing
Not now old monk.~|~translationMissing
OK then. Come back and let me know if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Oh hello, are you having trouble? The cogs are in four rooms below us. Place one cog on a pole on each of the four tower levels.~|~translationMissing
Right, gotcha. I'll do that then.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a bucket of water or ice gloves equipped~|~translationMissing
The cog is red hot from the flames. You cannot pick it up.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a bucket of water or ice gloves equipped~|~translationMissing
You pour water over the cog. It quickly cools down enough to take.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a black cog.)~|~translationMissing
Trying to open the door before the rats have been poisoned~|~translationMissing
This door does not seem to be openable.~|~translationMissing
Using the poison on the food trough~|~translationMissing
The rats swarm towards the poisoned food...~|~translationMissing
... and devour it hungrily.~|~translationMissing
You see them smashing against the gates in a panic.~|~translationMissing
They seem to be dying.~|~translationMissing
Opening the door after poisoning the rats~|~translationMissing
The death throes of the rats seem to have shaken the door loose its hinges. You pick it up and go through.~|~translationMissing
The cog fits perfectly.~|~translationMissing
I've placed a cog!~|~translationMissing
That's great. Come see me when you've done the other three.~|~translationMissing
Two down!~|~translationMissing
Two to go.~|~translationMissing
One left.~|~translationMissing
I have replaced all the cogs!~|~translationMissing
Really..? Wait, listen! Well done, well done! Yes yes yes, you've done it! You ARE clever!~|~translationMissing
The townsfolk will all be able to know the correct time now! Thank you so much for all of your help! And as promised, here is your reward!~|~translationMissing

Hello. Do you need any help? I'm looking for a quest.~|~translationMissing
Larry~|~translationMissing
Are you working for them?~|~translationMissing
Uh, I'm not sure. Who are they?~|~translationMissing
EXACTLY!~|~translationMissing
Seriously, what are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
I think you can be trusted. What do you know about...~|~translationMissing
penguins?~|~translationMissing
Uh...they live in the cold? That's about all.~|~translationMissing
Would you like to learn more about them? I'm conducting a, uh, research project, to, uh, learn about their social habits in their natural environment.~|~translationMissing
What do you need my help for?~|~translationMissing
Well, I need to build a shelter to hide from view, and it's always useful to have an extra pair of eyes, you know, for, uh, observing...Penguins.~|~translationMissing
So, are you up for it?~|~translationMissing
Okay, why not!~|~translationMissing
Okay, why not! But first, who are you and why are you researching penguins?~|~translationMissing
I, uh, was a zoo keeper here. But, I, uh, am on leave to go research penguins in their native habitat.~|~translationMissing
Ok! Okay then. So, what did you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
Right. I need you to gather materials for the bird hide, while I arrange for our transport.~|~translationMissing
You need to get 10 oak planks, 10 steel nails, a hammer, and a spade so that we can build a bird hide.~|~translationMissing
Once you have those, meet me up by the entrance to Keldagrim, east of Rellekka. I'll be there with a boat to take us to our destination.~|~translationMissing
Right, oak planks, steel nails, hammer, spade, east of Rellekka. Got it.~|~translationMissing
You've started a new quest~|~translationMissing
Cold War~|~translationMissing
Have you got the equipment?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have all the materials.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have them with me.~|~translationMissing
What do I need to get?~|~translationMissing
If missing the planks~|~translationMissing
You do not have enough oak planks.~|~translationMissing
If missing the nails~|~translationMissing
You do not have enough nails.~|~translationMissing
If missing the hammer~|~translationMissing
You need a hammer.~|~translationMissing
You have all the materials. Off to the iceberg!~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to go to the iceberg?~|~translationMissing
Screen fades and the player is transported to the iceberg~|~translationMissing
Where should I meet you when I have everything?~|~translationMissing
Once you have the items, meet me up by the entrance to Keldagrim, east of Rellekka. I'll be there with a boat to take us to our destination.~|~translationMissing
I have no idea where that is.~|~translationMissing
And you call yourself an adventurer! There is a road from Catherby going north. Take it until you reach the Sinclair Mansion.~|~translationMissing
Take a left at the Mansion, cross two bridges and follow the road until you reach Rellekka. Head east, around Rellekka to the coast near the entrance of Keldagrim.~|~translationMissing
Did I spell that out enough for you?~|~translationMissing
No need to be snippy.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I know where to go.~|~translationMissing
Never mind.~|~translationMissing
So, how do I make a bird hide?~|~translationMissing
Use the planks on the patch of snow on that ridge. Once you have that constructed, use the spade on the snow to cover the hide.~|~translationMissing
You create the bird hide structure.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I've made the structure. Now what?~|~translationMissing
Not bad... Now you need to cover the bird hide in snow with a spade.~|~translationMissing
You finish the bird hide.~|~translationMissing
Can we start observing the penguins?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Let's get in and start observing. You should note down anything interesting the penguins do. I'll include it in my, uh, research.~|~translationMissing
Larry and the player go into the hideout and a small cutscene begins observing two penguins.~|~translationMissing
Look, here come two penguins now.~|~translationMissing
The two penguins greet each other.~|~translationMissing
Aww, they're cute.~|~translationMissing
EVIL. I mean, how fascinating.~|~translationMissing
Looks like the penguins are on patrol again.~|~translationMissing
They're just walking around, Larry.~|~translationMissing
They are organised! ORGANISED I tell you!~|~translationMissing
I knew it. I knew they were up to something! Did you see that? They were patrolling!~|~translationMissing
That's crazy!~|~translationMissing
It did seem rather suspicious.~|~translationMissing
You believe me?~|~translationMissing
Of course! I mean, those penguins were acting quite strangely.~|~translationMissing
No one ever believes me. Can I...hug you?~|~translationMissing
Whoa there, I don't think this calls for hugging. What do we do next about the penguins?~|~translationMissing
We need to get closer to the penguins. Infiltrate them. Learn what they are doing.~|~translationMissing
How do you plan to do that?~|~translationMissing
We must get away from here before we discuss our plans. We don't want to be overheard.~|~translationMissing
How do you plan to infiltrate the penguins?~|~translationMissing
I have altered some designs of clockwork toys to make a clockwork penguin suit. We will use this to infiltrate their ranks.~|~translationMissing
What? We'll just set it off walking? What good will that do?~|~translationMissing
No! I'm going to use a spell to shrink you down so you can control it from the inside.~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute, why am I being shrunk? Why can't you get in the suit and annoy the penguins?~|~translationMissing
The penguins know my scent. They'd find me out and capture me and...torture me. No, it has to be you.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry. The spell only works if I'm nearby since I have to be constantly casting it. If trouble starts I'll be close by to help.~|~translationMissing
Gee, that's comforting.~|~translationMissing
Here's the book. It has my designs and a list of things you need to get. Use your Crafting table at your house to build it, just like regular clockwork toys.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Clockwork book.)~|~translationMissing
Why do I have to make the suit? I'm tired of doing all the legwork.~|~translationMissing
You have to make it, because since I got fired from the Zoo I've been homeless. Thanks for caring.~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry... Hey, you told me you were on leave to do research!~|~translationMissing
Well...it's permanent leave, and I am doing research!When I used to work at the Zoo, I noticed the penguins doing odd things, like taking notes or timing things. I asked to have my work detail transferred to their cage and I was fired!~|~translationMissing
I'm sure the penguins are behind it. So I kept spying on them and I'll prove everyone wrong!~|~translationMissing
So that's why you can't wear the suit? Because you used to work near them?~|~translationMissing
Err, no. I've had a few run-ins since then. But I don't have time for war stories, we need to concentrate on our mission!~|~translationMissing
When you're done making the suit, we'll head back to the iceberg and try it out.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the suit?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have it.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the suit~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to have the suit with you.~|~translationMissing
That's perfect. You are a very skilled crafter. Now we must return to the iceberg and test it.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to go to the iceberg?~|~translationMissing
I've lost the clockwork book, could I have another?~|~translationMissing
If the player still possesses the book~|~translationMissing
You haven't lost it, you just need to look for it more closely.~|~translationMissing
Well, lucky for you I did make another copy. But be more careful!~|~translationMissing
I'm a bit confused. Can you explain how to make the suit?~|~translationMissing
You need 1 piece of silk, 1 clockwork mechanism, and 1 wood plank.~|~translationMissing
The book will explain how to make the suit. But, since you seem to[sic] lazy to read it, I'll summarise.~|~translationMissing
Take the materials to your house and use the Crafting table to make clockwork toys. From there you can make the suit.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not done yet.~|~translationMissing
Look what they did to the bird hide! It's completely destroyed! The savages. The penguins are on to us.~|~translationMissing
I don't think it was the penguins.~|~translationMissing
I don't think it was the penguins. You can't even make out the prints clearly, it could have been anything.~|~translationMissing
Well of course you can't make out tracks. Penguins walk single file to hide their numbers! They're clever...so very clever.~|~translationMissing
It looks like a warning message to keep us away.~|~translationMissing
It looks like a warning message to keep us away. I didn't think penguins were violent by nature.~|~translationMissing
Oh, they act like they aren't, but it's all a guise. They wanted to scare us off. We must be on to something.~|~translationMissing
Well, there aren't any penguins around now, so we can't try out the suit.~|~translationMissing
But, we were so close to finding out what exactly is going on. It's all ruined now. How will we ever infiltrate them if there are none around to infiltrate?~|~translationMissing
There are other penguins. What about the ones at the Zoo? At least we can test the suit on them.~|~translationMissing
OF COURSE! You are brilliant. I should have thought of that. It's where all of this started. Let's return to the Zoo.~|~translationMissing
I can teleport us back to the Zoo. It'll be faster.~|~translationMissing
Then why the whole malarkey with the boat?~|~translationMissing
Boat rides lower my stress level.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to go to the Zoo?~|~translationMissing
I'm too tired to teleport again. You'll have to get back to the Zoo on your own.~|~translationMissing
I can teleport us back to the Zoo, but you'll have to make your own way back, teleports tire me out.~|~translationMissing
After I put you in the suit, use the little gate in the enclosure to get inside. The zoo keepers won't notice.~|~translationMissing
Guess we should try this out. How do you know a shrinking spell, anyway?~|~translationMissing
Well, a while back I was out in the field observing penguins. I worked for the Ardougne Zoo then. I was just quietly observing them when suddenly there was an avalanche.~|~translationMissing
Larry, you are one unlucky dude.~|~translationMissing
I'm not done! I was trapped, but a passing old man stopped to help. He said he would shrink me so I could crawl out from under the weight of the snow.~|~translationMissing
Then he taught me the spell in case I would have need of it again.~|~translationMissing
Seems like a pretty wise old man.~|~translationMissing
You see, that incident made me start suspecting the penguins, and my further work with them at the Zoo just confirmed it. I'm sure they got me fired. I know too much.~|~translationMissing
Right, well we don't have all day. Time to be a penguin!~|~translationMissing
Okay, but remember, if you move too far away from me the spell will break and you'll be normal sized again. Also, if you need to switch back, just ask me and I'll unshrink you.~|~translationMissing
Right, right. Let's just get this over with.~|~translationMissing
Penguin time!~|~translationMissing
If the player's hands aren't free~|~translationMissing
You will need your hands free to operate the suit.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing a cape~|~translationMissing
You can't wear a cape inside the suit, it might get caught.~|~translationMissing
You shrink and Larry puts you in the penguin suit.~|~translationMissing
Don't talk to me while you're in the suit! It'll give away your cover. Here, I'll get you out of it.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm ready to be big again! Please get me out of this.~|~translationMissing
All right, keep calm. One growth spurt coming up.~|~translationMissing
The spell wears off as you climb out of the suit, growing back to normal size.~|~translationMissing
Squack! Quack, quackity squack, squee.~|~translationMissing
Penguin~|~translationMissing
What do you think you are doing?~|~translationMissing
I'm, uh, speaking penguin, I think.~|~translationMissing
WAIT. How come you can speak in the common tongue? You're a penguin!~|~translationMissing
...So are you.~|~translationMissing
And you are speaking in the common tongue. So, what is your point?~|~translationMissing
Oh, right. Yes, of course! Uh, I was just, uh, testing you. Making sure you're on your toes, claws, whatever.~|~translationMissing
Operatives must not speak without giving the proper greeting. You have not given the proper greeting and until you do I have nothing more to say.~|~translationMissing
I better try and get this greeting right.~|~translationMissing
(Penguin emote interface in the control panel interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
If the player fails the greeting~|~translationMissing
I am sorry comrade, but you still have not shown me the proper greeting.~|~translationMissing
That is not the right greeting.~|~translationMissing
After one out of three correct moves~|~translationMissing
*Whew, that was right. Two more moves to do. If I get those right, he should speak to me.*~|~translationMissing
After two out of three correct moves~|~translationMissing
*I just need to do one more move and I'll have gotten the greeting right.*~|~translationMissing
After a full proper greeting~|~translationMissing
Welcome comrade. Now we may speak properly.~|~translationMissing
What news do you bring? Have you made progress with the main directive?~|~translationMissing
Uh, the main directive? Yeah...sure, I made progress with it. It was...easy?~|~translationMissing
It was easy!? It was easy to learn how to FLY?~|~translationMissing
Uh, yeah. I just kind of jumped off a hill and flapped a lot.~|~translationMissing
You flapped a lot? I didn't think we could fly like other birds.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Enlightened Journey~|~translationMissing
Then I flew in a hot air balloon.~|~translationMissing
A hot air balloon? This contraption made you fly?~|~translationMissing
This is very amazing. I will make note of it in my mission report.~|~translationMissing
Why is this so important? I mean, we're good swimmers, who cares if we can't fly?~|~translationMissing
Who cares? It's the entire reason we are in this wretched cage! We need to learn the secrets of flight, and the best way is to get these gullible humans to reveal it to us unwittingly. Blast them and their thumbs.~|~translationMissing
You sound kind of bitter.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I am. I'm tired of observing these humans and being gawked at by nasty little children. I miss the fresh codfish of our motherland.~|~translationMissing
Anything I can do?~|~translationMissing
You could take my mission report back to the outpost for me. I don't want to risk breaking out and blowing our cover.~|~translationMissing
You should check in with the operatives in Lumbridge before you head to the outpost. They might have some news for you to take as well.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Mission report (Ardougne).)~|~translationMissing
The penguin gave me his mission report and told me to go to Lumbridge to speak to the penguins there and then go to 'the outpost'.~|~translationMissing
Lumbridge? There aren't any penguins in Lumbridge. Not that I've seen. Where is this 'outpost'?~|~translationMissing
Maybe the penguins in Lumbridge are undercover?~|~translationMissing
I didn't find out where their outpost is. I'm hoping the ones in Lumbridge will tell me.~|~translationMissing
Seems kind of crazy that these penguins have mission reports and operatives.~|~translationMissing
They're organised little devils. Don't underestimate them.~|~translationMissing
You go on ahead to Lumbridge. I'll meet you there and put you in the suit.~|~translationMissing
They don't even have thumbs. How organised can they be?~|~translationMissing
So, we're in Lumbridge. Where are these penguins?~|~translationMissing
I was chatting with a local farmer, and there is a rumour about a 'thing' that lives around here. Maybe it's the penguin and these simple people don't recognise them.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
I should probably do the secret handshake before I try talking to these penguins.~|~translationMissing
Sheep~|~translationMissing
What do you think you are doing? You're going to blow our cover. Get away.~|~translationMissing
But I gave the correct greeting. You have to talk to me.~|~translationMissing
Every two-bit soldier knows that salute. We won't give you the time of the day without the secret phrase. Now GO AWAY.~|~translationMissing
But the penguins at the Zoo sent me. They spoke to me without some phrase.~|~translationMissing
They are lazy, good for nothing codfish addicts. GO AWAY.~|~translationMissing
The penguins won't talk to me without some stupid secret phrase. These penguins are crazy!~|~translationMissing
No, I keep trying to tell you, they aren't crazy, they are dangerous and organised.~|~translationMissing
Well, since the penguin at the Zoo is the only one talking to you, maybe you should ask him.~|~translationMissing
I can teleport us back to the Zoo, but you'll have to make your own way back. Teleports tire me out.~|~translationMissing
The penguins in Lumbridge refuse to talk to me.~|~translationMissing
The penguins in Lumbridge refuse to talk to me. They keep demanding a secret phrase.~|~translationMissing
So, tell them the phrase. It's not exactly hard to remember. Pescaling Pax has a strange sense of humour.~|~translationMissing
Pesca-what?~|~translationMissing
Pescaling Pax. The Pescallion's son. Well, one of them. He's in charge of research and development at our headquarters.~|~translationMissing
Oh, where all of the penguins...I mean us...live?~|~translationMissing
Comrade! You really do have a funny sense of humour. No, our people live in the great city of Palingrad, of course. Ah, home, I miss it.~|~translationMissing
You sound pretty homesick. Can't you go and visit Palingrad?~|~translationMissing
If only. The Pescallion has declared that until we have finished our research of the southern species and have developed our great plan, we may not return. So I am stuck here observing humans.~|~translationMissing
Gee, I sure would like to get back, too. If only you'd tell me the phrase, so I could get the other mission report and move on.~|~translationMissing
How do you not know the phrase, comrade?~|~translationMissing
Uh, I forgot what the phrase was.~|~translationMissing
That was very careless of you, comrade. But it is your problem, not mine.~|~translationMissing
I must have left the outpost before they gave out the phrase.~|~translationMissing
No one left before it was given out. I was one of the first operatives to leave, and I know it.~|~translationMissing
Is it Rumpelstiltskin?~|~translationMissing
I need that phrase! Isn't there anything you can do?~|~translationMissing
If player is wearing a Ring of Charos~|~translationMissing
The Ring of Charos persuades the penguin to help you.~|~translationMissing
As you are a comrade, I suppose it is my duty to help you.~|~translationMissing
The phrase is 'Do not trust the walrus'.~|~translationMissing
With a raw cod in inventory~|~translationMissing
I see you have some raw cod with you comrade. I might be willing to exchange information for it, if you are willing.~|~translationMissing
Sure!~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Raw cod.)~|~translationMissing
Thank you comrade. This is like a taste of the motherland. The phrase is 'Do not trust the walrus.'~|~translationMissing
Hmm, no I'll hang on to it.~|~translationMissing
I am sorry comrade, but I cannot break protocol without good reason.~|~translationMissing
Where is the outpost?~|~translationMissing
The Zoo penguin won't tell me the phrase.~|~translationMissing
Maybe there's something he wants, something you can trade for the phrase? Or maybe there's some kind of magic that would persuade him?~|~translationMissing
Well, what do penguins like?~|~translationMissing
I once had to clean all the penguins feet, back when I had a job.~|~translationMissing
I distracted them by giving them cod fish and then did the job. It was gross.~|~translationMissing
I don't think I ever want to be a Zoo keeper.~|~translationMissing
Or perhaps there's some sort of magic that could persuade the penguin? An object of power or the like?~|~translationMissing
Yes, comrade?~|~translationMissing
I need that phrase!~|~translationMissing
(See 'Asking the Zoo penguin the phrase' section above)~|~translationMissing
I got the phrase! These penguins are so weird. It's something about a walrus.~|~translationMissing
You aren't taking this seriously! They are dangerous!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, and organised. I know.~|~translationMissing
Oh, just go talk to the sheep.~|~translationMissing
Do not trust the walrus.~|~translationMissing
Fine. What do you want?~|~translationMissing
The penguin at the Zoo told me to see if you had any news.~|~translationMissing
We can't get any news in this field! All these humans keep trying to shear us!~|~translationMissing
We think the Farmer may be an agent for the other side, trying to have us assassinated by all these foolish humans. If you investigate him for us, we can finish our mission report and you can go on your way.~|~translationMissing
You want me to disguise myself as a human and talk to the Farmer? Seems like a tough request. I'll only do it if you tell me how to get to the outpost.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean 'How to get to the outpost'? Any intelligent penguin knows that.~|~translationMissing
Are you calling me dumb? Fine. You can talk to the Farmer yourself, and compromise your mission.~|~translationMissing
No, no, we'll tell you. You just deal with the Farmer.~|~translationMissing
Fred the Farmer~|~translationMissing
What are you doing on my land?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm looking for something to kill.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm lost.~|~translationMissing
I need to talk to you about penguins.~|~translationMissing
About what now? What do penguins have to do with anything?~|~translationMissing
Bully Fred~|~translationMissing
Warn Fred~|~translationMissing
You know that 'Thing' out in your field? It's two penguins in disguise.~|~translationMissing
Like I haven't heard that before.~|~translationMissing
No really, it is! They're trying to observe humans to learn our weaknesses.~|~translationMissing
Then why are they disguised as sheep?~|~translationMissing
They probably thought they'd blend in better. Anyway, I came to warn you to not annoy them too much. They're funny little guys but they seem to have a grudge against you.~|~translationMissing
You talk to these penguins?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have a penguin suit and I know the secret greeting. I'm infiltrating them because this crazy guy Larry is convinced they are trying to take over the world or something.~|~translationMissing
Look, when these voices in your head start talking to you again, you might want to ignore them.~|~translationMissing
HEY! I'm not crazy! Larry's a little left of centre, but I'm just helping him out. The penguins really can talk.~|~translationMissing
Right, right. I believe you, sure. Maybe on your way out you could ask the sheep to herd themselves for me.~|~translationMissing
Fine. Don't believe me. Larry and I will prove you wrong. Just don't go near the penguins, Fred, not if you value your life.~|~translationMissing
Is the Farmer an agent for the other side?~|~translationMissing
The farmer is definitely an enemy.~|~translationMissing
The Farmer is definitely an enemy. High ranking too, I think. He might even be the King of Lumbridge in disguise!~|~translationMissing
King? I thought there was a duke, not a king.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's why he's in disguise. Duh.~|~translationMissing
This is an amazing revelation. We must include it in our report. Thank you, we'll mention your bravery.~|~translationMissing
The Farmer is harmless.~|~translationMissing
The Farmer is harmless. The sheep, however...now they seem pretty crafty.~|~translationMissing
The sheep? But...They just wander around in this field all day. Trust us, we know.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! So you don't suspect them! That's why they are so cunning. Watch your backs.~|~translationMissing
You have a good point. Yes, we must warn Pescaling Pax of this new threat. We'll put it in the report and you can give it to them.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Mission report (Lumbridge).)~|~translationMissing
Well, off you go now!~|~translationMissing
Hey wait, you said you'd tell me where the outpost is!~|~translationMissing
You are one clueless penguin. The outpost is the iceberg to the North. The entrance is concealed by what looks like an avalanche.~|~translationMissing
When you try and go through a guard will stop you and ask for the password.~|~translationMissing
The password is cabbage. Don't forget it.~|~translationMissing
Haa haa, this is fun!~|~translationMissing
What? How?~|~translationMissing
If the player told the penguins that Fred is a threat~|~translationMissing
I just convinced them Fred the Farmer was the King of Lumbridge!~|~translationMissing
But there is no King of Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! They are so gullible. Even if they are organised.~|~translationMissing
Don't take this so lightly. You might put Fred in danger because you were having a laugh.~|~translationMissing
Sorry. It was just a bit of fun.~|~translationMissing
If the player told the penguins that Fred is harmless~|~translationMissing
I just convinced the penguins that the sheep are agents for the other side.~|~translationMissing
They are?~|~translationMissing
No! They're just sheep. But I wanted to confuse the penguins. Put them off our scent.~|~translationMissing
What a good plan! I just hope the sheep aren't working for the other side.~|~translationMissing
Larry, we need to get you to hang out with people, not animals.~|~translationMissing
I know where their outpost is! The entrance is on the iceberg. It's concealed by an avalanche.~|~translationMissing
Great. Let's go back to the iceberg, I'll put you in your suit and we'll really see what these penguins are up to.~|~translationMissing
Now you can try and enter the outpost. This is exciting.~|~translationMissing
It's fun for you! You're not risking your neck.~|~translationMissing
But you don't think penguins are dangerous anyway. So there's no danger is there? Or are you coming around to my thinking that they are dangerous?~|~translationMissing
No...I mean...yes. Oh never mind. Just do the spell. Wait, won't the spell wear off once I'm inside? You'll be too far away.~|~translationMissing
Oh, no. The ice magnifies this spell, so it will allow you to go greater distances.~|~translationMissing
This guy looks official. I'd better do the greeting before I speak to him.~|~translationMissing
KGP Agent~|~translationMissing
Password?~|~translationMissing
Cabbage.~|~translationMissing
Let's see your ID and you can go through.~|~translationMissing
ID? No one told me anything about ID.~|~translationMissing
No ID, no entry!~|~translationMissing
The penguin at the entrance said I needed to have an ID. Nobody told me about any ID!~|~translationMissing
ID? But...they all look alike. Well, the other penguins probably just assumed you had it, since you said you were an agent.~|~translationMissing
You know, I met a rather shifty looking penguin once, north of Miscellania. He was named after some sort of pasta...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, he worked for a black market. Maybe he has a contact here who could get you an ID?~|~translationMissing
Penguins have black markets?~|~translationMissing
Of course. Just look around here for a shifty pasta penguin.~|~translationMissing
Noodle~|~translationMissing
Oi, mate, 'u innerested i' sum 'wares?~|~translationMissing
Uh...maybe?~|~translationMissing
I go' me sum hot 'wares, mate. Wotcha need?~|~translationMissing
Well, I've misplaced me, I mean my, ID card.~|~translationMissing
Ah, frisky nigh' on leave, eh? Betcha furgo' yur missin repor' 'oo.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, my missin repor'. I think I need one of them too.~|~translationMissing
Well, mate. 'U scratch me back, I stab urs, right?~|~translationMissing
What? No, no stabbing.~|~translationMissing
I men' in a good way. I wan' sumpin in exy-change. Ima in need of sum swamp tur.~|~translationMissing
Tur? Do you mean tar?~|~translationMissing
Thas wha' I sed, innit? I need sum feathers 'oo. Foive of 'em.~|~translationMissing
So you need swamp tar and five feathers. Will chicken feathers do?~|~translationMissing
Yea, begreat. Then I'll guv yea 'ur stuff.~|~translationMissing
Yuv go' the stuff?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I got it.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the items~|~translationMissing
Whers me swamp tur 'n feathers, mate?~|~translationMissing
With swamp tar only~|~translationMissing
Whers me feathers, mate?~|~translationMissing
With feathers only~|~translationMissing
Whers me swamp tur, mate?~|~translationMissing
Oi, cheers. 'Ers 'ur stuff, now git outta 'ere.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Swamp tar, Feathers.)~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Kgp id card, Mission report (fake).)~|~translationMissing
What did you need?~|~translationMissing
I need swamp tur and foive feathers, mate.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about this black market.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about this black market you run. Seems kind of risky.~|~translationMissing
Nah ain't risky. Bu' I dun run it. Me bruva, Alfredo, does. E runs the Fettuccine Mafia.~|~translationMissing
Riiiight. Fettucine Mafia. I'll remember that.~|~translationMissing
Need summat?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I need some replacements.~|~translationMissing
If player has the Kgp id~|~translationMissing
U dunna need ID.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Kgp id card.)~|~translationMissing
If player has the Mission report~|~translationMissing
Oi, 'u got 'ur repor'.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Mission report (fake).)~|~translationMissing
Without the ID in hand~|~translationMissing
All right, you can go in. The entrance is hidden under that avalanche.~|~translationMissing
Once inside, go into the room to the left. You'll be debriefed there. No dawdling!~|~translationMissing
You enter the secret lair.~|~translationMissing
You have unlocked a new music track~|~translationMissing
Espionage~|~translationMissing
Welcome back agent...~|~translationMissing
Peach? But, aren't you...male?~|~translationMissing
It was either that or Pear.~|~translationMissing
Ah. Of course.~|~translationMissing
So you have just returned from your mission?~|~translationMissing
Yes, and I have my mission report. I also have the mission reports from the operatives in the Ardougne Zoo and the Lumbridge sheep field.~|~translationMissing
How very industrious of you, agent. Please hand them over.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Mission report (Ardougne), Mission report (Lumbridge), Mission report (fake).)~|~translationMissing
Hmm, these reports are...intriguing.~|~translationMissing
It says you jumped off a hill and flew? Without assistance?~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah. It was amazing. You know, I just...flapped. Really fast.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, we shall have to research this.~|~translationMissing
You flew in a 'hot air balloon'? What is that exactly?~|~translationMissing
Well, it was a sack of cloth with a basket attached to the bottom and when you filled it with hot air it went up.~|~translationMissing
Fascinating. Well done agent.~|~translationMissing
I am satisfied with your reports. You just need to complete a physical and you will be free to roam at your leasure.~|~translationMissing
A physical? What, are they going to examine my body?~|~translationMissing
Oh no. It's an agility course to make sure you're still fit and able to serve. Don't worry, I'm sure you won't have any difficulty getting through it. Just go through the door at the end of the room.~|~translationMissing
Agility Instructor~|~translationMissing
Well done soldier! You've successfully completed the physical. You're free to do as you like.~|~translationMissing
What do I do now?~|~translationMissing
Just go through the gate in the fence and use the same door you came out of. You can come back whenever you like to tone up your body.~|~translationMissing
All those penguins, what are they doing?~|~translationMissing
Army Commander~|~translationMissing
Ah, they are doing drills! Getting ready for the invasion. What a glorious day that will be!~|~translationMissing
Invasion? Of...~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, I know we all get excited. But, I need you to get out of the way. Move along!~|~translationMissing
Larry, you were right! There's an entire army of them, and they're drilling and... Larry, they're ORGANISED!~|~translationMissing
That's what I've been saying from the start! But an entire army? This is just an outpost, so it can't be an entire army.~|~translationMissing
I know what I saw! They were doing drills and everything.~|~translationMissing
Still, it must only be an invasion party. The main force is on...well, it doesn't matter right now.~|~translationMissing
I've been doing some research of my own, and I think I know what our next step should be. There's a secret room, deep in the glacier. I think that is where they are making their war plans.~|~translationMissing
War plans! Who are they going to war with?~|~translationMissing
With us, you dolt! They are trying to take over the world. Have you not grasped this yet? You need to find that room. Our future depends on it.~|~translationMissing
Where could this room be?~|~translationMissing
It's probably the most well guarded room in the place. You'll need to find a way to get into it without arousing suspicion.~|~translationMissing
That's a pretty tall order.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing out here! You need to get in there and find the secret room.~|~translationMissing
You there, let me through those doors.~|~translationMissing
Let's see your ID, comrade.~|~translationMissing
No problem!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry comrade, you do not have the clearance to go through these doors.~|~translationMissing
You look like...knowledgeable...penguins. What's through those doors at the end of the hall?~|~translationMissing
Pong~|~translationMissing
Hey man, don't stress. Those doors open new worlds, man. Like, new rooms too.~|~translationMissing
Yes, well, I would like to know what rooms.~|~translationMissing
Ping~|~translationMissing
Like, the War Room and stuff like that, dude. Wicked stuff. Too bad only 'the man' gets to go through.~|~translationMissing
Humans can go through?~|~translationMissing
No, man. He just means the authority. The MAN, you know?~|~translationMissing
Who are you? You don't really look like KGP agents.~|~translationMissing
Dude, we are bards. We sing of the glories of the common penguin. We are also supposed to record history, but man, it is so HIS story. Like, the MAN's story.~|~translationMissing
Penguins have bards?~|~translationMissing
Totally, dude. You want to hear one of our songs?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I haven't got anything to lose, except my eardrums.~|~translationMissing
Well, like, we can't play it in THIS now. Maybe at a later now. We don't have any instruments to accompany our great song.~|~translationMissing
But this room is filled with instruments.~|~translationMissing
Yeah man, but they come from the south, where humans have thumbs to play them with. We don't have thumbs. Also, the Pescaling had our old ones confiscated for being too loud.~|~translationMissing
Way harsh, man.~|~translationMissing
But dude, I was reading, and there are instruments we could play. I read about one called bongos. They just need to be hit.~|~translationMissing
But we need two instruments, man. Like, to make it harmonious with the vibes.~|~translationMissing
What about a cowbell? You don't need thumbs for that.~|~translationMissing
Righteous man. So you'll get a cowbell and bongos for us and we'll rock out. We'll be so harmonious, no Pescallion could complain.~|~translationMissing
Wait, why am I getting these instruments?~|~translationMissing
Because your aura says you should.~|~translationMissing
Man, did you bring the instruments to us?~|~translationMissing
What did I need to get you?~|~translationMissing
We want a cowbell and a set of bongos.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have either~|~translationMissing
You didn't bring the instruments.~|~translationMissing
With cowbells only~|~translationMissing
You didn't bring the bongos.~|~translationMissing
With  bongos only~|~translationMissing
You didn't bring a cowbell.~|~translationMissing
Dude, good job on the instruments. Just let us set up and we'll get going.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Cowbells and Bongos.)~|~translationMissing
A cutscene shows Ping and Pong performing a song~|~translationMissing
And a 1 and a 2 and a 3...~|~translationMissing
Wait, wait. It needs more cowbell.~|~translationMissing
You're right, man. Let's try this again!~|~translationMissing
(Ping and Pong begin playing their instruments)~|~translationMissing
There once was a Pescallion, who travelled in a galleon.~|~translationMissing
Our Pescallion went exploring and found this iceberg [sic]~|~translationMissing
He travelled the world, until his toes curled.~|~translationMissing
Upon an iceberg he came, and our lives were never the same.~|~translationMissing
As an outpost it was approved, so here our people moved.~|~translationMissing
To grow and learn, though our hearts did yearn...~|~translationMissing
For the motherland.~|~translationMissing
Deep inside the 'berg lay a threat, but don't fret!~|~translationMissing
For Pescaling Pax trapped those monsters behind a gate, but let's hope they don't mate.~|~translationMissing
Now we have no fear~|~translationMissing
But shed a small tear for the motherland.~|~translationMissing
(The gate's KGP Agent enters the room)~|~translationMissing
All right, that's enough racket.~|~translationMissing
Shut those instruments up or I'm throwing you in solitary!~|~translationMissing
I don't care if your vibes are harmonious!~|~translationMissing
Now might be a good time for me to slip out and get through those doors...~|~translationMissing
(Player quietly leaves the room)~|~translationMissing
End of cutscene~|~translationMissing
A cutscene shows the player being caught~|~translationMissing
Pescaling Pax~|~translationMissing
And we'll move this little penguin here...and KABLOOM! Heee hee.~|~translationMissing
(Player is transformed back to human)~|~translationMissing
It appears we have a visitor!~|~translationMissing
Haa haa! I am glad we installed that ant-magic security. What have we here?~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Penguin suit.)~|~translationMissing
What about me?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, take that human to the Ice Lords. They'll enjoy the exercise.~|~translationMissing
You are caught.~|~translationMissing
You're safe! I was really worried for a while there. What happened?~|~translationMissing
Ice Lord...hit me...ow...~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, you're very brave. I mean what happened in the War Room?~|~translationMissing
Pescaling Pax was there, and he forced me out of the suit and then threw me into a cage with the Ice Lords!~|~translationMissing
But what was IN the War Room?~|~translationMissing
There was a map of the world and a lot of little penguin figures.~|~translationMissing
YES! I knew it! I said I'd prove them all wrong. They are organised and invading. OH YEAH, Larry was right. Who was right? Larry was!~|~translationMissing
Larry performs the Dance emote.~|~translationMissing
LARRY! We've just uncovered a plot that could destroy everything we hold dear. Don't you think we should focus on stopping them?~|~translationMissing
You are such a buzz kill.~|~translationMissing
We need to plan our next move, but now they know both our scents and might come after us!~|~translationMissing
No, they only know mine. That agility course really stank up the suit and seems to have covered your scent. You might want to consider bathing soon.~|~translationMissing
As for our next move, I've got...friends...elsewhere who should hear of this information, but we have plenty of time. It's not as though they made a break through in their research or something.~|~translationMissing
The screen fades into a brief cutscene showing a giant penguin suit under construction within their outpost before returning to the player.~|~translationMissing
The hide was destroyed. It's too damaged to rebuild, so we can't use it to observe penguins any more.~|~translationMissing
You appear to be stuck and need Larry's help to get out of the suit.~|~translationMissing
I can't speak to the penguins when I'm not in my disguise.~|~translationMissing
You can't use a stile when in the penguin suit.~|~translationMissing
(a KGP Agent appears)~|~translationMissing
The KGP thinks you are a threat.~|~translationMissing
There's been a breach! Red alert!~|~translationMissing
(The player is knocked down and transported to the iceberg entrance next to Larry)~|~translationMissing
As soon as the player moves~|~translationMissing
Urrrrrgh!~|~translationMissing
Failing to steal the bell~|~translationMissing
You fail to steal a cowbell.~|~translationMissing
The cow kicks you and stuns you!~|~translationMissing
(The player takes some damage.)~|~translationMissing
Dairy cow~|~translationMissing
MOO~|~translationMissing
You steal a cowbell.~|~translationMissing
You use the leather and plank to create penguin bongos.~|~translationMissing
The Ice Lords prevent your escape.~|~translationMissing

7 Contact established~|~translationMissing
Good day.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. How goes things?~|~translationMissing
Better now that we've sorted out that business with Klenter. Still, we're no closer to dealing with these plagues.~|~translationMissing
However, we do have one bit of good news in that area, thanks to you.~|~translationMissing
Thanks to me?~|~translationMissing
Yes. You've shown us that the pox we're all infected with can't be contagious. If it was, you'd be covered in spots by now.~|~translationMissing
That's a very good point. Does this mean you can reopen the city?~|~translationMissing
It does indeed. The decision to lock things down was made very quickly, so we were forced to trap many of our citizens outside the walls. We'll be able to let them all back in now.~|~translationMissing
That's wonderful news!~|~translationMissing
It is, but there is a problem.~|~translationMissing
When the plague first started, Menaphos, our neighbouring city, closed their gates as well. Many of our citizens became trapped there when they did.~|~translationMissing
But if there's no risk of them becoming infected, can't they open up again as well?~|~translationMissing
You'd think so, but they believe that there is still a danger. It seems they're even willing to kill if it helps keep their city isolated.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Perhaps I could help?~|~translationMissing
You'd really be willing to help us again?~|~translationMissing
Of course!~|~translationMissing
I'm very grateful. To be honest though, I'm not really sure where to start with this.~|~translationMissing
Well first up, why don't you tell me what happened with Menaphos? You said something about them being willing to kill?~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Earlier today, I led a delegation across the bridge between the two cities in the hope of convincing them to end the quarantine. It didn't go well...~|~translationMissing
(Cut scene 1 begins.)~|~translationMissing
Coenus~|~translationMissing
Halt! Don't take another step!~|~translationMissing
That is an improper greeting. You address the High Priest of Icthlarin!~|~translationMissing
We have discovered that we are not contagious. You must let us pass!~|~translationMissing
Step back or we will open fire.~|~translationMissing
You wouldn't dare!~|~translationMissing
Archers, take your mark!~|~translationMissing
You wouldn't?~|~translationMissing
Take aim!~|~translationMissing
Run!~|~translationMissing
Fire!~|~translationMissing
(End of cut scene.)~|~translationMissing
So they just started firing arrows at you? They sound like cold-blooded thugs.~|~translationMissing
It is often the way under Pharoah Kemesis. He leads the Menaphites in a more secular manner than we would like. Respect for the old ways is diminishing.~|~translationMissing
By old ways, do you mean Icthlarin?~|~translationMissing
The whole Menaphite Pantheon really. Religion is starting to mean less and less in Menaphos.~|~translationMissing
There was once a time when we would care for all of Menaphos' dead here. Now, many opt for less traditional burials.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I've let myself become distracted. My focus is often on the dead, but right now our main worry is the living.~|~translationMissing
It's clear that the Pharaoh has no desire to open his city, so we need to find another way of getting our citizens home.~|~translationMissing
Any ideas on how we do that?~|~translationMissing
Well... I don't know. I'm open to any ideas you have.~|~translationMissing
What if I disguised myself as a citizen or a guard?~|~translationMissing
It would not work. Their quarantine is very strict, just as ours was. Even their own people are not allowed in or out of the city.~|~translationMissing
So how do they get food and other supplies in?~|~translationMissing
The port south of the main city is still open. Traders take their goods to the city gates and exchange them with the guards there. Everything is thoroughly checked.~|~translationMissing
I see. Doesn't sound like we can make anything work there then.~|~translationMissing
(Shows initial options)~|~translationMissing
Is there any way across the river?~|~translationMissing
You'd want to swim across? If the current doesn't kill you, the crocodiles surely will.~|~translationMissing
Ah... Maybe not then.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I could fight my way in?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely not! We here in Sophanem are still Menaphites and those guards are our brethren. Besides, I doubt you'd succeed against so many of them.~|~translationMissing
Is there any way into Menaphos from below?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I don't think so.~|~translationMissing
Oh. So there aren't any tunnels under this city?~|~translationMissing
Beyond the homes of our dead? I can't imagine so. We are not ones for digging tunnels unnecessarily. We leave that nonsense to the Sect of Scabaras, and they're long gone.~|~translationMissing
The Sect of Scabaras?~|~translationMissing
They were a group dedicated to Scabaras, one of the lesser deities.~|~translationMissing
What's a lesser deity?~|~translationMissing
You already know of Icthlarin and the Devourer. They are the son and daughter of Tumeken and Elidinis. Together, they are the four main deities of the Menaphite Pantheon.~|~translationMissing
However, the pantheon also has four lesser deities, or avatars as some call them. The Book of Light and Day says that Tumeken once fell into a deep sleep and dreamt for four days and four nights.~|~translationMissing
With each night, his dreams took form. Those four forms became the lesser deities of the pantheon, with Scabaras being the last of them.~|~translationMissing
And his followers liked to dig tunnels?~|~translationMissing
That's right. Scabaras is the god of isolation. In keeping with his teachings, his followers mostly lived underground. As such, they were said to be great architects of the subterranean.~|~translationMissing
So what happened to them?~|~translationMissing
The Devourer was not the only member of the pantheon to wish ill upon our people. It is said that many years ago, Scabaras and his sect tried to claim these lands as their own.~|~translationMissing
They built great tunnels beneath the Elid and used them to attack our settlements. However, Elidinis stood against them. The sect was destroyed, and Scabaras was fittingly driven into isolation.~|~translationMissing
And you don't think there's a chance they might have built some tunnels under Sophanem and Menaphos?~|~translationMissing
Er... I suppose I've never considered it before. I guess it's not impossible.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should visit Jex at the Temple of the Lesser Gods in the north east corner of the city. He knows more about the Sect of Scabaras than I do.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. I'll pay him a visit.~|~translationMissing
I'll have a think about it.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Did you visit Jex at the Temple of the Lesser Gods?~|~translationMissing
You'll find the temple in the north east corner of the city.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Are you Jex?~|~translationMissing
Jex~|~translationMissing
That's right. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I'm hoping to learn a bit more about the Sect of Scabaras. The High Priest said you'd be a good person to ask.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. To be honest, not much is known about them. The sect was destroyed long ago. However, it is said that this temple was once their home.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of the temple, what happened here? The place isn't looking great.~|~translationMissing
It was just before the plagues started! They burst up from under the cellar and trashed the place! It was late at night, so I couldn't see who they were, or if they were even human!~|~translationMissing
What? Why wasn't the High Priest aware of this?~|~translationMissing
The first of the plagues started that next morning. It didn't seem wise to bother him.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure he'd have still liked to have been made aware. You say they came from beneath the cellar?~|~translationMissing
That's right. Turns out there's quite the network of tunnels down there.~|~translationMissing
Well then I think this is just what I'm after. I'd like to investigate these tunnels.~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't if I were you. It's incredibly dangerous down there. We had a quick look, but there are some fearsome traps and vicious monsters lurking in the darkness.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid it's essential that I go down there.~|~translationMissing
Well then you're either very brave or very foolish. We covered the tunnel they made with a trapdoor. Just head down into the cellar and then down that trapdoor.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's also very dark down there. You should take some sort of light source and a tinderbox with you.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. You've been a great help.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about the lesser gods?~|~translationMissing
Of course. The lesser gods, or avatars as some call them, were born from the dreams of Tumeken. They are Apmeken, Het, Crondis and Scabaras.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about Apmeken?~|~translationMissing
Apmeken is the goddess of companionship. She is known to be the most mischievous, playful and unpredictable of the minor deities. I'd say she's my personal favourite.~|~translationMissing
So I shouldn't trust you then?~|~translationMissing
Apmeken can appeal to the most erudite scholar or the most barefaced liar. I'd like to be considered amongst the former category.~|~translationMissing
I see. What does she look like?~|~translationMissing
She has the head of a monkey, or sometimes an ape. It changes depending upon what nature she is displaying. For example, the orangutan represents wisdom, while the baboon represents mischief.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about Het?~|~translationMissing
Het is the least strange of our deities to foreign eyes, for he looks just like us. I suspect this is why his shrines are particularly targeted by thieves like that infamous Templeton.~|~translationMissing
What does he represent?~|~translationMissing
Het is the god of health, both in mind and body. He is quite popular amongst soldiers as a result, especially up in Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
Just soldiers?~|~translationMissing
Not at all! Like I said, the wellbeing of the mind is also key to Het. Many great orators also look to him for guidance. I imagine his teachings help with some of their strenuous speeches.~|~translationMissing
How did his followers react to the plagues here?~|~translationMissing
With many arguments. They really couldn't decide whether it was a punishment from Het, or an affront to him. I stayed out of that debate.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about Crondis?~|~translationMissing
Crondis is a ferocious lady with the head of a mighty crocodile.~|~translationMissing
That must be awkward when buying helmets.~|~translationMissing
Luckily for her, I don't think deities have much need for them.~|~translationMissing
So what is she the goddess of?~|~translationMissing
Resourcefulness. A word which seems to be open to large interpretation.~|~translationMissing
Most consider her to be a teacher of modesty. They say we should be resourceful by only taking and using that which we absolutely need.~|~translationMissing
But there's others with a different interpretation?~|~translationMissing
Some believe she is actually the goddess of pleasure. They claim that the idea of modesty came from a misinterpretation, and that to be resourceful is to take all that you can.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound right.~|~translationMissing
No. It is a more recent take that I suspect was born in Menaphos. There are many in that city with more wealth than they'll ever need. Modesty is not an ideal they'll ever embody.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about Scabaras?~|~translationMissing
There are many opinions out there on Scabaras, but general knowledge isn't always the most accurate.~|~translationMissing
Well what are the absolute facts then?~|~translationMissing
Scabaras is the god of isolation. He takes on the appearance of a man with the head of a scarab. Both he and his followers were driven into hiding long ago.~|~translationMissing
And?~|~translationMissing
And that's it. You asked for the absolute facts. Anything beyond that is just speculation.~|~translationMissing
But there must be more. The High Priest told me that Scabaras tried to conquer these lands.~|~translationMissing
So it is said, but the written accounts that exist contain so many inconsistencies when it comes to what role Scabaras actually played. Of course, most would not know that.~|~translationMissing
Many of the writings are only available to us priests. That does of course include the new High Priest, but perhaps he is yet to read them. They are definitely... illuminating.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. Thanks for the information.~|~translationMissing
Note~|~translationMissing
This dialogue and prompt changes to "Thanks for the information." after a deity is asked about.~|~translationMissing
I'd better get down there.~|~translationMissing
Hello Jex.~|~translationMissing
How's your investigation going?~|~translationMissing
I haven't made it down to the tunnels yet.~|~translationMissing
Well don't forget to take a light source and a tinderbox with you.~|~translationMissing
I will. Thanks for the warning.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Any luck with getting our people out of Menaphos?~|~translationMissing
Well just let me know if I can help in any way.~|~translationMissing
Sophanem Guard~|~translationMissing
What are you doing down here?~|~translationMissing
We're here to guard this place. Until recently, this was a bank, but then something came from the tunnels below and trashed the place.~|~translationMissing
Now we're guarding the trapdoor down to the tunnels instead.~|~translationMissing
Do you have a tinderbox?~|~translationMissing
I do, but I'd like to hold on to it for now.~|~translationMissing
That's okay, I have one with me anyway.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a tinderbox~|~translationMissing
I have one I could sell you for 50 coins.~|~translationMissing
I'll take it.~|~translationMissing
The guard hands you a tinderbox in exchange for 50 coins.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, that's too expensive.~|~translationMissing
No problem. Come back if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Do you have a torch?~|~translationMissing
If the player has a lit or unlit torch~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a lit or unlit torch~|~translationMissing
I'll sell you an unlit one for 200 coins.~|~translationMissing
The guard hands you an unlit torch in exchange for 200 coins.~|~translationMissing
How come you're not spotty?~|~translationMissing
Ah, the pox. We weren't here when the outbreak took place. We were out of town trying to catch an antiques thief called Simon Templeton. We've only just got back.~|~translationMissing
Aren't you afraid you'll fall ill as well?~|~translationMissing
The only reason we've been let back into the city is because the High Priest believes the pox isn't contagious.~|~translationMissing
Besides, Sophanem is my home. It will take a lot more than the threat of a few spots to keep me away.~|~translationMissing
You can't. I'd better go.~|~translationMissing
This dialogue and prompt changes to "I'd better go." if at least one other dialogue prompt is chosen first.~|~translationMissing
Be careful down there!~|~translationMissing
I will, I will.~|~translationMissing
It really is incredibly dangerous down there!~|~translationMissing
So people keep telling me.~|~translationMissing
You should take some food down with you in case you get hurt!~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't take many valuables down there, just in case something bad happens.~|~translationMissing
Have some faith in me.~|~translationMissing
Watch out for the traps!~|~translationMissing
If you see a scarab on any of the walls, stay well away from it!~|~translationMissing
Um, why?~|~translationMissing
I saw one of the other guards disappear down a trapdoor when he approached it. We never saw him again!~|~translationMissing
I'll look out for them then.~|~translationMissing
Good luck!~|~translationMissing
Not bad. Hopefully I'll make some real progress soon.~|~translationMissing
Well good luck, and be careful in those tunnels.~|~translationMissing
What the... You're not Kaleef!~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not, I'm [player name]. As for Kaleef, I'm afraid I have some bad news about him.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but Kaleef is dead.~|~translationMissing
Dead? He can't be dead! You're lying!~|~translationMissing
It's true. It looks like some creature killed him as he was entering this cavern.~|~translationMissing
Kaleef... Curse you, Osman!~|~translationMissing
Were the two of you close?~|~translationMissing
What... I...~|~translationMissing
No. I barely knew him. He was meant to relieve me of my posting up in Menaphos, but now I'm stuck.~|~translationMissing
Not that it matters I suppose. Even if he had made it, he wouldn't have been able to get across this chasm. We'd hoped there would be a route between the two cities down here, but clearly not.~|~translationMissing
To be honest, that's kind of what I was hoping as well. I came down here to try and find a way into Menaphos.~|~translationMissing
Well good luck with that. If there was a way into the city, I'd have found it by now. This was my last hope.~|~translationMissing
So you have no way to leave?~|~translationMissing
Oh I could leave. While I may not know of any way into the city, I do know of a way out. Problem is, I was ordered not to leave until I found a way for Kaleef to get in.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... That gives me an idea.~|~translationMissing
An idea? What are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
The reason I'm looking for a way into Menaphos is so that I can help the citizens of Sophanem trapped there return home. However, maybe I don't actually need to enter the city to help them.~|~translationMissing
You said you knew of a way out of the city. You could help the citizens escape.~|~translationMissing
And why would I do that?~|~translationMissing
Because if you help me, I might be able to help you. You mentioned Osman, right? I'm guessing you work for him, which makes you a spy from Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
That's right... I'm Maisa. You know Osman?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'm the one who helped him free Prince Ali. I'm sure I could convince him to reconsider your posting.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... If you are who you say you are, tell me where the Prince was being kept.~|~translationMissing
Pollnivneach.~|~translationMissing
Draynor Village.~|~translationMissing
Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
Goblin Village.~|~translationMissing
Then we have nothing to discuss.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. And who helped you free the Prince?~|~translationMissing
Hassan.~|~translationMissing
Louie Legs.~|~translationMissing
Leela.~|~translationMissing
Ranael.~|~translationMissing
The correct answers are "Draynor Village" and "Leela".~|~translationMissing
If zero answers are right~|~translationMissing
You're obviously an imposter. You answered both questions incorrectly!~|~translationMissing
If one answer is right~|~translationMissing
You'll have to do better than that to convince me.~|~translationMissing
If both answers are right~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. I'm sorry I doubted you. I will help the citizens of Sophanem for you, but first you must convince Osman to come here and meet with me.~|~translationMissing
You want him to come here?~|~translationMissing
Yes. No more secret messages or intermediaries. I want to speak to him, face to face.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll go to Al Kharid and see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
You again. If you are who you say you are, tell me where Prince Ali was being kept.~|~translationMissing
Have you brought Osman?~|~translationMissing
Don't take too long. It's not safe for me to stay down here.~|~translationMissing
I want to talk to you about Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
Sophanem?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Your help is needed urgently there.~|~translationMissing
My help is needed all over the place. What makes you suggest that I'm more urgently needed in Sophanem?~|~translationMissing
Maisa wants to speak with you.~|~translationMissing
Maisa? You are mistaken. She's in Menaphos, and that city is locked tight to everyone, thanks in no small part to me.~|~translationMissing
What? What have you been up to there?~|~translationMissing
Nothing you need to concern yourself with.~|~translationMissing
You don't need to be so secretive with me. Did I not prove myself by freeing Prince Ali?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Very well. What do you know of the political landscape here in the Kharidian Desert?~|~translationMissing
Not a lot.~|~translationMissing
Well unlike many other regions, the Kharidian Desert is not united under a single banner. Instead, there are multiple independent city states, along with various lawless collectives.~|~translationMissing
While all of the city states are currently at peace with each other, between some you'll find certain... rivalries.~|~translationMissing
Oh I see. So one of those rivalries is between Menaphos and Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
Some would say so.~|~translationMissing
Including you?~|~translationMissing
We were at war with the Menaphites for a long time. As Spymaster for Al Kharid, I know that no war is ever truly over.~|~translationMissing
Does the Emir agree with you on that?~|~translationMissing
The Emir trusts me to protect the best interests of Al Kharid. So in answer to your original question, that's what I've been doing in Menaphos and Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
Look, this is all very interesting, but one of your people, Kaleef, is dead. He was meant to relieve Maisa of her post in Menaphos, but now he can't.~|~translationMissing
Then I will send someone else down instead. Is that all?~|~translationMissing
No. Maisa is insisting that you meet with her personally.~|~translationMissing
That's not possible and she knows it. It would be tantamount to sticking one's head in a crocodile's mouth. If the Menaphites caught me, I'd be lynched on sight.~|~translationMissing
Now, return to her and tell her that I will send a replacement for Kaleef shortly.~|~translationMissing
That's not going to work. There's a chasm blocking the way from Sophanem to Menaphos. Any agent you send won't be able to enter the city. That's why Maisa wants to speak with you.~|~translationMissing
If there's no way for someone to relieve Maisa, then she will have to remain there herself. This is the job she signed up for.~|~translationMissing
But I need Maisa to help me with something. She'll only do that if you go and speak to her.~|~translationMissing
That is your problem, not mine.~|~translationMissing
And Prince Ali was your problem, but I still helped you.~|~translationMissing
And you were paid for your services. What do you need from Maisa anyway?~|~translationMissing
When Menaphos was locked down, many citizens from Sophanem were trapped there. I need to try and get them out of the city, but I have no way of entering Menaphos myself.~|~translationMissing
So, you've convinced Maisa to help them on your behalf? What makes you think I want any part in this? The citizens of Sophanem are still Menaphites.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Let's see...~|~translationMissing
It must be boring here.~|~translationMissing
You wish to charm me with the idea of getting my hands dirty? Well I'm perfectly happy here in Al Kharid. I did all the adventuring I ever wanted to do in my youth.~|~translationMissing
There might be treasures underneath Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
That there might be, but if so, those treasures belong to the dead. We have treasures aplenty here in Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
It could drive a wedge between the Menaphite cities.~|~translationMissing
Menaphos wouldn't be happy if the citizens of Sophanem bypassed the quarantine. I imagine you'd be able to take advantage of that.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Alright, you have my curiosity. Let's see where this trail takes us. Meet me outside the gates to Sophanem. I have one or two things to sort out here before I depart.~|~translationMissing
It would give you the chance to spy first hand.~|~translationMissing
I have Maisa and others in place to do that already.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps because there is no suitable answer. Now, I must get on with my work.~|~translationMissing
The dialogue and prompt changes to "Fine. I give up." and "So you've seen sense? Good. Now, I must get on with my work." after a failed persuasion choice is made.~|~translationMissing
As I've already told you, I have little interest in this business of yours. Why should I help you?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes. I have one or two things to sort here before I depart. I'll meet you outside the gates to Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
There you are.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you're here. Do you know of a good way into the city? I'm getting too old for scaling walls.~|~translationMissing
What's wrong with using the gates?~|~translationMissing
Are you mad or stupid?~|~translationMissing
Neither. Why?~|~translationMissing
What if I'm recognised? Do you not think they'd question the presence of Al Kharid's Spymaster?~|~translationMissing
Okay, so maybe it wasn't one of my better suggestions.~|~translationMissing
Have any other bright ideas?~|~translationMissing
I know of a secret entrance to the north.~|~translationMissing
Perfect! Where is it?~|~translationMissing
There's a tunnel in some rocks near a camp.~|~translationMissing
Good. Now, wait for me here. There's no point in both of us risking our necks getting seen together.~|~translationMissing
What if you injure yourself down in the tunnels?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about me. I may be getting older, but I didn't become Spymaster without getting into a fight or two.~|~translationMissing
But there's...~|~translationMissing
Give me two hours. If I'm not back by then, come and look for me.~|~translationMissing
(Cut scene 2 begins.)~|~translationMissing
Psst!~|~translationMissing
Huh?~|~translationMissing
(After cut scene 2 ends, the player yawns outside Sophanem.)~|~translationMissing
Osman's been gone for hours. I think I should have a look for him.~|~translationMissing
Oh... hello again.~|~translationMissing
Are you okay?~|~translationMissing
Some degenerate clubbed me and gave me a lump the size of an egg on the back of my head.~|~translationMissing
Oh no! I'll keep my eyes peeled for suspicious looking characters.~|~translationMissing
I have a fairly good idea who did it.~|~translationMissing
What? Who?~|~translationMissing
That linen merchant, Siamun. He's never liked me.~|~translationMissing
...and whatever you do, don't risk giving yourself away when you help the citizens return.~|~translationMissing
I know what I'm doing Osman.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... What's going on? What's that shaking?~|~translationMissing
Get out of here quick! Before the cave collapses!~|~translationMissing
Osman!~|~translationMissing
Uh oh...~|~translationMissing
I seem to recall telling you to wait for me. What are you doing down here?~|~translationMissing
Rescuing your ungrateful hide!~|~translationMissing
I had everything under control.~|~translationMissing
Well your two hours ran out a long time ago. Anyway, where did you disappear off to during the fight?~|~translationMissing
I didn't go anywhere. I decided to blend into the shadows. It's one of the many tricks I've picked up over the years. Not every problem needs a blade to solve it.~|~translationMissing
Right... So are you going to say 'thank you' or anything?~|~translationMissing
That's not required. Once again, I had it all under control.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you'll be pleased to know that before we were interrupted, I was able to convince Maisa to remain in Menaphos. As agreed, she will help the citizens of Sophanem return home.~|~translationMissing
That's good to hear. I guess I should let the High Priest know.~|~translationMissing
Before you leave, it seems that Kaleef was able to at least get one hit on that beast. I suggest you take his dagger. It's quite powerful, and he has no need for it now. Note~|~translationMissing
This line is only said if Keris is not picked up before speaking to Osman.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and one more thing...~|~translationMissing
Well done. You did an alright job here.~|~translationMissing
Thanks... I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Narration~|~translationMissing
Osman leaves the cavern.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. I have some wonderful news.~|~translationMissing
Menaphos just sent over some of their dead. Imagine our surprise when we found some of our own citizens disguised among them! Apparently we have both you and someone called Maisa to thank.~|~translationMissing
Disguised among the dead? That's quite ingenious. I'm glad to hear they're home safe.~|~translationMissing
It seems that we are once again in your debt. Please, take this as a thank you.~|~translationMissing

What am I to do?~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, I'm in a terrible terrible mess! It's the Duke's birthday today, and I should be making him a lovely big birthday cake.~|~translationMissing
I've forgotten to buy the ingredients. I'll never get them in time now. He'll sack me! What will I do? I have four children and a goat to look after. Would you help me? Please?~|~translationMissing
Start the Cook's Assistant quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll help you.~|~translationMissing
Oh thank you, thank you. I need milk, an egg and flour. I'd be very grateful if you can get them for me.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the necessary items~|~translationMissing
I have all of those ingredients on me already!~|~translationMissing
That's an odd coincidence... Were you planning on making a cake too?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly. I just had an odd feeling you might be needing these ingredients. If I see a cook, I presume there's food of some kind! Lucky guess I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Well thank you! Hand them over, please.~|~translationMissing
You hand the cook all of the ingredients.~|~translationMissing
You've brought me everything I need! I am saved! Thank you!~|~translationMissing
So do I get to go to the Duke's Party?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, only the big cheeses get to dine with the Duke.~|~translationMissing
Well, maybe one day I'll be important enough to sit on the Duke's table.~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but I won't be holding my breath.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the necessary items~|~translationMissing
So where do I find these ingredients then?~|~translationMissing
Where do I find some flour?~|~translationMissing
There is a Mill fairly close, go North and then West. Mill Lane Mill is just off the road to Draynor. I usually get my flour from there.~|~translationMissing
If the player has an empty pot with them~|~translationMissing
Talk to Millie, she'll help, she's a lovely girl and a fine Miller. Make sure you take a pot with you for the flour though, you've got one on you already.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an empty pot with them~|~translationMissing
Talk to Millie, she'll help, she's a lovely girl and a fine Miller. Make sure you take a pot with you for the flour though, there should be one on the table in here.~|~translationMissing
How about milk?~|~translationMissing
There is a cattle field on the other side of the river, just across the road from the Groats' Farm.~|~translationMissing
Talk to Gillie Groats, she looks after the Dairy cows - she'll tell you everything you need to know about milking cows!~|~translationMissing
If the player has an empty bucket with them~|~translationMissing
You'll need an empty bucket for the milk itself. I do see you've got a bucket with you already luckily!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an empty bucket with them~|~translationMissing
You'll need an empty bucket for the milk itself. The general store just north of the castle will sell you one for a couple of coins.~|~translationMissing
And eggs? Where are they found?~|~translationMissing
I normally get my eggs from the Groats' farm, on the other side of the river.~|~translationMissing
But any chicken should lay eggs.~|~translationMissing
I've got all the information I need. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I know where to find this stuff.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't feel like it. Maybe later.~|~translationMissing
Fine. I always knew you Adventurer types were callous beasts. Go on your merry way!~|~translationMissing
You're a cook, why don't you bake me a cake?~|~translationMissing
*sniff* Don't talk to me about cakes...~|~translationMissing
You don't look very happy.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not. The world is caving in around me - I am overcome by dark feelings of impending doom.~|~translationMissing
I'd take the rest of the day off if I were you.~|~translationMissing
No, that's the worst thing I could do. I'd get in terrible trouble.~|~translationMissing
Well maybe you need to take a holiday...~|~translationMissing
That would be nice, but the Duke doesn't allow holidays for core staff.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, why not run away to the sea and start a new life as a Pirate?~|~translationMissing
My wife gets sea sick, and I have an irrational fear of eyepatches. I don't see it working myself.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I've run out of ideas.~|~translationMissing
I know I'm doomed.~|~translationMissing
Nice hat!~|~translationMissing
Err thank you. It's a pretty ordinary cooks hat really.~|~translationMissing
Still, suits you. The trousers are pretty special too.~|~translationMissing
Its all standard cook's issue uniform...~|~translationMissing
The whole hat, apron, stripey trousers ensemble - it works. It makes you look like a real cook.~|~translationMissing
I am a real cook! I haven't got time to be chatting about Culinary Fashion. I am in desperate need of help!~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on with finding the ingredients?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not obtained anything yet~|~translationMissing
I haven't got any of them yet, I'm still looking.~|~translationMissing
Please get the ingredients quickly - I'm running out of time! The Duke will throw me into the streets!~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't handed in at least one item. Items are removed from the list when handed in~|~translationMissing
You still need to get~|~translationMissing
A bucket of milk A pot of flour An egg~|~translationMissing
Can you remind me how to find these things again?~|~translationMissing
Here's a bucket of milk.~|~translationMissing
Here's a pot of flour.~|~translationMissing
Here's a fresh egg.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not brought all the ingredients~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the ingredients you have got so far. Please get the rest quickly - I'm running out of time! The Duke will throw me into the streets!~|~translationMissing

Do you have any quests for me?~|~translationMissing
I don't know if you can help us!~|~translationMissing
The trolls have taken up camp on Death Plateau! They are using it to launch raids at night on the village. We have tried to attack the camp but the main path is heavily guarded!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps there is a way you can sneak up at night?~|~translationMissing
If there is another way I do not know of it.~|~translationMissing
Do you know of such a path?~|~translationMissing
Start the Death Plateau quest?~|~translationMissing
No but perhaps I could try and find one?~|~translationMissing
Citizen you would be well rewarded!~|~translationMissing
If you go up to Death Plateau be very careful as the trolls will attack you on sight!~|~translationMissing
One other thing.~|~translationMissing
All of our equipment is kept in the castle on the hill.~|~translationMissing
The stupid guard that was on duty last night lost the combination to the lock! I told the Prince that the Imperial Guard should've been in charge of security!~|~translationMissing
No problem, what does the combination look like?~|~translationMissing
The equipment room is unlocked when the stone balls are placed in the correct order on the stone mechanism outside it. The right order is written on a piece of paper the guard had.~|~translationMissing
A stone what...?!~|~translationMissing
Well citizen, the Prince is fond of puzzles. Why we couldn't just have a key is beyond me!~|~translationMissing
I'll get on it right away!~|~translationMissing
No, sorry.~|~translationMissing
Never mind citizen.~|~translationMissing
Can I assist you with anything else?~|~translationMissing
What is this place?~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the Principality of Burthorpe!~|~translationMissing
We are the Imperial Guard for his Royal Highness Prince Anlaf of Burthorpe.~|~translationMissing
You can't, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hello citizen, is there anything you'd like to know?~|~translationMissing
Can you remind me of the quest I am on?~|~translationMissing
You offered to see if you could find another way up Death Plateau. We could then use it to sneak up and attack the trolls by night.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, and the guard had lost the combination to your equipment room in the castle on the hill?~|~translationMissing
That's right citizen, you offered to recover the combination and unlock the door.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else you would like to know?~|~translationMissing
I thought the White Knights controlled Asgarnia?~|~translationMissing
You are right citizen. The White Knights have taken advantage of the old and weak king, they control most of Asgarnia, including Falador. However they do not control Burthorpe!~|~translationMissing
We are the prince's elite troops! We keep Burthorpe secure!~|~translationMissing
The White Knights have overlooked us, until now! They are pouring money into their war against the Black Knights, they are looking for an excuse to stop our funding and I'm afraid they may have found it!~|~translationMissing
If we can not destroy the troll camp on Death Plateau then the Imperial Guard will be disbanded and Burthorpe will come under control of the White Knights. We can not let this happen!~|~translationMissing
That's all, thanks.~|~translationMissing
God speed citizen.~|~translationMissing
I'd better not go into someone's bedroom without a reason!~|~translationMissing
Hi!~|~translationMissing
Eohric~|~translationMissing
Hi, can I help?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for the guard that was on last night.~|~translationMissing
There was only one guard on last night. Harold. He's a nice lad, if a little dim.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where he is staying?~|~translationMissing
Harold is staying at the Toad and Chicken.~|~translationMissing
Do you know of another way up Death Plateau?~|~translationMissing
No, sorry. I wouldn't want to go north-east from here, it's very rocky and barren.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm just looking around.~|~translationMissing
You knock on the door.~|~translationMissing
Harold~|~translationMissing
Come in!~|~translationMissing
You're the guard that was on duty last night?~|~translationMissing
Yeah.~|~translationMissing
Denulth said that you lost the combination to the equipment room?~|~translationMissing
I don't want to talk about it!~|~translationMissing
I said I don't want to talk about it!~|~translationMissing
I found Harold but he won't talk to me!~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Harold has got in trouble a few times over his drinking and gambling. Perhaps he'd open up after a drink?~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I'll try that!~|~translationMissing
You said that Harold had a weakness?~|~translationMissing
Yes, if you buy Harold a beer he might talk to you. I also know he has a weakness for gambling. Hope that helps!~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the help!~|~translationMissing
Can I buy you a drink?~|~translationMissing
Now you're talking! An Asgarnian Ale please!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an Asgarnian ale~|~translationMissing
I'll go and get you one.~|~translationMissing
You give Harold an Asgarnian Ale.~|~translationMissing
Arrh. That hit the spot!~|~translationMissing
Where were you when you last had the combination?~|~translationMissing
I honestly don't know! I've looked everywhere. I've searched the castle and my room!~|~translationMissing
Have you tried looking between here and the castle?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I tried that.~|~translationMissing
I need another beer.~|~translationMissing
Would you like to gamble?~|~translationMissing
Good. Good. I have some dice. How much do you want to offer?~|~translationMissing
Enter amount~|~translationMissing
(player input)~|~translationMissing
If the player enters 0~|~translationMissing
You have to offer some money.~|~translationMissing
If the player enters more than they are holding~|~translationMissing
You do no have that much money!~|~translationMissing
If the player enters more than 1000~|~translationMissing
Woah! Do you think I'm made of money? Max bet is 1000 gold.~|~translationMissing
OK. I'll roll first!~|~translationMissing
Don't forget that once I start my roll you can't back out of the bet! If you do you lose your stake!~|~translationMissing
(Gambling interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Sounds good! I normally drink Asgarnian Ale but you know what?~|~translationMissing
I really fancy one of those Blurberry Specials. I never get over to the Gnome Stronghold so I haven't had one for ages!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a Blurberry special~|~translationMissing
You give Harold a Blurberry Special.~|~translationMissing
Wow!~|~translationMissing
Now THAT hit the spot!~|~translationMissing
'Ello matey!~|~translationMissing
Hmm...!~|~translationMissing
Er...!~|~translationMissing
What wash the queshtion?~|~translationMissing
Shure!~|~translationMissing
Place your betsh pleashe!~|~translationMissing
*giggle*~|~translationMissing
Eashy tiger! Max bet ish 1000 coinsh.~|~translationMissing
Right...er...here goes...~|~translationMissing
I fink I've had enough!~|~translationMissing
(End of dialogue)*~|~translationMissing
If Harold is not drunk and Harold wins~|~translationMissing
You give Harold his winnings.~|~translationMissing
If Harold is not drunk and the player wins~|~translationMissing
If Harold still has money~|~translationMissing
Harold has given you your winnings!~|~translationMissing
If Harold is out of money~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I seem to have run out of money!~|~translationMissing
Here's what I have.~|~translationMissing
Harold has given you some of your winnings!~|~translationMissing
I'll write you out an IOU for the rest.~|~translationMissing
Harold has given you an IOU scribbled on some paper.~|~translationMissing
If Harold is drunk~|~translationMissing
Shixteen! How am I shupposhed to beat that!~|~translationMissing
I didn't know you could ushe four dishe. Oh well.~|~translationMissing
*hic*~|~translationMissing
I sheemed to have rolled a one.~|~translationMissing
Harold is so drunk he can hardly see, let alone count!~|~translationMissing
Um...not enough money.~|~translationMissing
Heresh shome of it.~|~translationMissing
I owe you the resht!~|~translationMissing
If Harold is not drunk~|~translationMissing
I've lost the IOU you gave me.~|~translationMissing
I'll write you another.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet read the IOU~|~translationMissing
If the player has read the IOU~|~translationMissing
Harold has given you the IOU, which you know is the combination.~|~translationMissing
I've run out of money!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. I need beer.~|~translationMissing
If the player has an Asgarnian ale~|~translationMissing
*burp*~|~translationMissing
Mmm... Asgarnian Ale.~|~translationMissing
I'm shure I had money, not anymore!~|~translationMissing
The IOU says that Harold owes me some money.~|~translationMissing
Wait just a minute!~|~translationMissing
The IOU is written on the back of the combination! The stupid guard had it in his back pocket all the time!~|~translationMissing
You have found the combination!~|~translationMissing
The equipment room door has unlocked.~|~translationMissing
Archer~|~translationMissing
Thank goodness you opened that door! I've been trapped here since last night!~|~translationMissing
What is this castle?~|~translationMissing
Welcome to Burthorpe Castle! Home to his Royal Highness the Prince of Burthorpe, Heir to the Throne of Asgarnia!~|~translationMissing
Anything else I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
Where is the prince?~|~translationMissing
We do not disclose his majesty's business.~|~translationMissing
Yes actually I do, we need another servant.~|~translationMissing
Does this noble quest have a name?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's the... er... Empty the Cesspit Quest!~|~translationMissing
I'll give it a miss!~|~translationMissing
I've unlocked the equipment room so I just need to find an alternate route up Death Plateau!~|~translationMissing
Good work citizen!~|~translationMissing
Are you OK?~|~translationMissing
Soldier~|~translationMissing
Urrrgggh.....~|~translationMissing
I'll be OK, the trolls only leave the plateau at nightfall. The guys are bringing a stretcher shortly.~|~translationMissing
As long as you're sure.~|~translationMissing
It's my own fault really, I was having a walk and wandered past the danger sign. The trolls throw rocks down at any one who goes up the path!~|~translationMissing
Don't go up there!~|~translationMissing
OK, thanks for the warning.~|~translationMissing
Tenzing~|~translationMissing
No milk today! Thank you!~|~translationMissing
Saba~|~translationMissing
What?!~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for the guard that was on duty at the castle last night.~|~translationMissing
Who?!~|~translationMissing
Buzz off!~|~translationMissing
Why would I want to go up there? I just want to be left in peace!~|~translationMissing
It used to be just humans trampling past my cave and making a racket. Now there's those blasted trolls too! Not only do they stink and argue with each other loudly but they are always fighting the humans.~|~translationMissing
I just want to be left in peace!~|~translationMissing
Ah... I might be able to help you.~|~translationMissing
How?!~|~translationMissing
I'm trying to help the...er...humans to reclaim back Death Plateau. If you help me then at least you'd be rid of the trolls.~|~translationMissing
Hmph.~|~translationMissing
Let me see...~|~translationMissing
I've only been up Death Plateau once to complain about the noise but those pesky trolls started throwing rocks at me!~|~translationMissing
Before the trolls came there used to be a nettlesome Sherpa that took humans exploring or something equally stupid. Perhaps he'd know another way.~|~translationMissing
Where does this Sherpa live?~|~translationMissing
I don't know but it can't be far as he used to be around all the time!~|~translationMissing
Nothing, sorry!~|~translationMissing
Have you got rid of those pesky trolls yet?~|~translationMissing
Where did you say this Sherpa was?~|~translationMissing
I dunno but he must live around here somewhere!~|~translationMissing
I'm not the milkman, I need your help!~|~translationMissing
Oh...OK. You'd better come in then.~|~translationMissing
Where do you think you're going? This is private property!~|~translationMissing
Hello. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
I'm helping the Imperial Guard. They need to find a way to sneak up Death Plateau to destroy the troll camp! Saba seemed to think you'd be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Ah...Saba is still alive and kicking?~|~translationMissing
Yeh, he seemed very bitter.~|~translationMissing
That's Saba alright!~|~translationMissing
I do know of a secret way up to Death Plateau, the Imperial Guard would be able to use it at night and not be seen until it was too late!~|~translationMissing
I'd be happy to show you it if you do something for me first.~|~translationMissing
Name it.~|~translationMissing
I don't get into town much and I'm getting low on supplies. I need ten loaves of bread and ten cooked trout, that should see me through the winter.~|~translationMissing
Anything else?~|~translationMissing
Yes. My climbing boots need to have new spikes, so can you take them to Dunstan in Burthorpe? He always puts my spikes on for me.~|~translationMissing
OK, I'll get those for you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you traveller!~|~translationMissing
Tenzing has given you his climbing boots.~|~translationMissing
I'll find the secret way for myself.~|~translationMissing
Has Dunstan added spikes to my climbing boots yet?~|~translationMissing
Well, when he has, bring the boots to me with ten loaves of bread and ten cooked trout. I have to prepare for the winter, after all.~|~translationMissing
Dunstan~|~translationMissing
Hi! How can I help?~|~translationMissing
Tenzing has asked me to bring you his climbing boots, he needs to have spikes put on them.~|~translationMissing
He does, does he? Well I won't do it till he pays for the last set I made for him!~|~translationMissing
This is really important!~|~translationMissing
Well, I need the Sherpa to show me a secret way up Death Plateau so that the Imperial Guard can destroy the troll camp! He won't help me till I've got the spikes!~|~translationMissing
Hmm. That's different!~|~translationMissing
Tell you what, I'll make them for you on one condition.~|~translationMissing
*sigh* What's the condition?~|~translationMissing
My son has just turned 16 and I'd very much like him to join the Imperial Guard. The Prince's elite forces are invite only so it's very unlikely he'll get in. If you can arrange that you have a deal!~|~translationMissing
That won't be a problem as I'm helping out the Imperial Guard!~|~translationMissing
Excellent! You'll need to bring an Iron bar for the spikes!~|~translationMissing
Have you managed to get my son signed up for the Imperial Guard?~|~translationMissing
Not yet! I just need to speak to Denulth!~|~translationMissing
Hello citizen, have you found another way up Death Plateau?~|~translationMissing
Yes there is another way up Death Plateau!~|~translationMissing
We are saved!~|~translationMissing
There's one thing...~|~translationMissing
And what is that citizen?~|~translationMissing
There is a Sherpa who will only show me the secret way if I first get some spikes for his climbing boots. The smith will only do this for me if you sign up his son for the Imperial Guard!~|~translationMissing
Hmm...this is very irregular.~|~translationMissing
Will you not do this?~|~translationMissing
I have heard of Dunstan's son, he is a very promising young man. For the sake of your mission we can make an exception!~|~translationMissing
Denulth has given you a certificate.~|~translationMissing
This certificate proves that we have accepted Dunstan's son for training in the Imperial Guard!~|~translationMissing
Thank you Denulth, I shall be back shortly!~|~translationMissing
Hello citizen, have you found the secret way up Death Plateau?~|~translationMissing
I'm working on it but I've lost the certificate!~|~translationMissing
No problem, I have a duplicate.~|~translationMissing
I have but I don't have the entrance certificate on me.~|~translationMissing
Good but I need to have the certificate.~|~translationMissing
You give Dunstan the certificate.~|~translationMissing
Now to keep my end of the bargain. Give me the boots and an iron bar and I'll put on the spikes.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the boots and an iron bar~|~translationMissing
You give Dunstan an iron bar and the climbing boots.~|~translationMissing
Dunstan has given you the spiked boots.~|~translationMissing
If the player has neither climbing boots nor iron bar~|~translationMissing
I don't have the iron bar or the climbing boots.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the climbing boots~|~translationMissing
I don't have the climbing boots.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an iron bar~|~translationMissing
I don't have the iron bar.~|~translationMissing
I see you've got the spiked boots. Are you going to take them to the Sherpa?~|~translationMissing
I will do shortly.~|~translationMissing
Trying to walk in these would be difficult. I'll carry them for now.~|~translationMissing
Have you brought me the items I asked for?~|~translationMissing
I've lost the climbing boots.~|~translationMissing
These are expensive, do not lose another pair!~|~translationMissing
Tenzing has given you some climbing boots.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing spiked boots, bread, and trout~|~translationMissing
I don't have the~|~translationMissing
Spiked boots. Ten loaves of bread. Ten cooked trout.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing spiked boots and bread~|~translationMissing
Spiked boots. Ten loaves of bread.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing spiked boots and trout~|~translationMissing
Spiked boots. Ten cooked trout.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing bread and trout~|~translationMissing
Ten loaves of bread. Ten cooked trout.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing spiked boots~|~translationMissing
Spiked boots.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing bread~|~translationMissing
Ten loaves of bread.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing trout~|~translationMissing
Ten cooked trout.~|~translationMissing
You give Tenzing the Spiked boots.~|~translationMissing
You give Tenzing the loaves of bread and the cooked trout.~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much traveller. I'm now ready for the winter!~|~translationMissing
You said you would show me the secret way to Death Plateau?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course! I drew up a map in case I ever needed to use it again.~|~translationMissing
Tenzing has given you a map of the secret way!~|~translationMissing
Tenzing has given you a map of the secret way~|~translationMissing
I don't think the Trolls have found the secret way yet, if they had I would've been attacked by now.~|~translationMissing
OK thanks but I think I'd better check the path. I don't want to send the Imperial Guards to their death!~|~translationMissing
You are wise for one so young.~|~translationMissing
Hello Tenzing!~|~translationMissing
Hello again traveller. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I've lost the secret way map.~|~translationMissing
Never mind. I'll quickly draw you another one.~|~translationMissing
I'm lost!~|~translationMissing
To get back to Burthorpe follow the path going east.~|~translationMissing
I thought you were going to investigate the secret way to Death Plateau? Use the back door to my hut, hop over the stile and follow that path.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, of course! Thanks!~|~translationMissing
Go in peace traveller.~|~translationMissing
I'm working on it!~|~translationMissing
Grr!~|~translationMissing
That looks dangerous. I'll need a good reason before I venture that way.~|~translationMissing
I think this is far enough, I can see Death Plateau and it looks like the trolls haven't found the path. I'd better go and tell Denulth.~|~translationMissing
Yes! There is a path that runs from a Sherpa's hut around the back of Death Plateau. The trolls haven't found it yet. The Sherpa made a map I can give you.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the map~|~translationMissing
I don't have the map on me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the map~|~translationMissing
You give Denulth the map of the secret way.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, this looks perfect. They will never see us coming.~|~translationMissing
Have you managed to open the equipment room?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the combination~|~translationMissing
I have opened the door but I don't have the combination on me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the combination~|~translationMissing
Yes! The door is open and here is the combination.~|~translationMissing
You give Denulth the combination to the equipment room.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not turned in all the items~|~translationMissing
If the player has turned in all the items~|~translationMissing
Well done citizen! We will reward you by training you in attack!~|~translationMissing
Hello citzen, I have the map of the secret way you gave me earlier.~|~translationMissing
I have the combination to the equipment room that you recovered for me.~|~translationMissing

Aris~|~translationMissing
Hello young one.~|~translationMissing
Cross my palm with silver and the future will be revealed to you.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have any money with them~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. I don't have any money.~|~translationMissing
Come closer, and listen carefully to what the future holds for you, as I peer into the swirling mists of the crystal ball.~|~translationMissing
I can see images forming. I can see you.~|~translationMissing
You are holding a very impressive looking sword. I'm sure I recognise that sword...~|~translationMissing
There is a big dark shadow appearing now.~|~translationMissing
Aaargh!~|~translationMissing
Are you all right?~|~translationMissing
It's Delrith! Delrith is coming!~|~translationMissing
Who's Delrith?~|~translationMissing
Delrith...~|~translationMissing
Delrith is a powerful demon.~|~translationMissing
Oh! I really hope he didn't see me looking at him through my crystal ball!~|~translationMissing
He tried to destroy this city 150 years ago. He was stopped just in time by the great hero Wally.~|~translationMissing
Using his magic sword Silverlight, Wally managed to trap the demon in the stone circle just south of this city.~|~translationMissing
Ye gods! Silverlight was the sword you were holding in my vision! You are the one destined to stop the demon this time.~|~translationMissing
How am I meant to fight a demon who can destroy cities?~|~translationMissing
How am I meant to fight a demon who can destroy cities?!~|~translationMissing
If you face Delrith while he is still weak from being summoned, and use the correct weapon, you will not find the task too arduous.~|~translationMissing
Do not fear. If you follow the path of the great hero Wally, then you are sure to defeat the demon.~|~translationMissing
Okay, where is he? I'll kill him for you!~|~translationMissing
Ah, the overconfidence of the young!~|~translationMissing
Delrith can't be harmed by ordinary weapons. You must face him using the same weapon that Wally used.~|~translationMissing
Wally doesn't sound like a very heroic name.~|~translationMissing
Wally doesn't sound a very heroic name.~|~translationMissing
Yes I know. Maybe that is why history doesn't remember him. However he was a very great hero.~|~translationMissing
Who knows how much pain and suffering Delrith would have brought forth without Wally to stop him!~|~translationMissing
It looks like you are going to need to perform similar heroics.~|~translationMissing
So how did Wally kill Delrith?~|~translationMissing
Wally managed to arrive at the stone circle just as Delrith was summoned by a cult of chaos druids...~|~translationMissing
A cutscene showing Wally defeating Delrith~|~translationMissing
Wally~|~translationMissing
Die, foul demon!~|~translationMissing
Now, what was that incantation again?~|~translationMissing
The following five words are Aber, Gabindo, Purchai, Camerinthum, and Carlem. The order of the five words is random.~|~translationMissing
[word 1]... [word 2]... [word 3]... [word 4]... [word 5]!~|~translationMissing
I am the greatest demon slayer EVER!~|~translationMissing
Cutscene over~|~translationMissing
By reciting the correct magical incantation, and thrusting Silverlight into Delrith while he was newly summoned, Wally was able to imprison Delrith in the stone block in the centre of the circle.~|~translationMissing
Delrith will come forth from the stone circle again.~|~translationMissing
I would imagine an evil sorcerer is already starting on the rituals to summon Delrith as we speak.~|~translationMissing
What is the magical incantation?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, let me think a second...~|~translationMissing
The following five words Aber, Gabindo, Purchai, Camerinthum, and Carlem~|~translationMissing
Alright, I think I've got it now, it goes.... [word 1]... [word 2]... [word 3]... [word 4]... [word 5]. Have you got that?~|~translationMissing
I think so, yes.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Silverlight?~|~translationMissing
Silverlight has been passed down through Wally's descendants. I believe it is currently in the care of one of the King's knights called Sir Prysin.~|~translationMissing
He shouldn't be too hard to find. He lives in the royal palace in this city. Tell him Aris sent you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks. I'll do my best to stop the demon.~|~translationMissing
Ok thanks. I'll do my best to stop the demon.~|~translationMissing
Good luck, and may Guthix be with you!~|~translationMissing
Demon Slayer is started.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't believe in that stuff.~|~translationMissing
Ok suit yourself.~|~translationMissing
Greetings. How goes thy quest?~|~translationMissing
Well if you need any advice I'm always here, young one.~|~translationMissing
Stop calling me that!~|~translationMissing
In the scheme of things you are very young.~|~translationMissing
Ok but how old are you?~|~translationMissing
Ok, but how old are you?~|~translationMissing
Count the number of legs on the stools in the Blue Moon inn, and multiply that number by seven.~|~translationMissing
Er, yeah, whatever.~|~translationMissing
Oh if it's in the scheme of things that's ok.~|~translationMissing
You show wisdom for one so young.~|~translationMissing
Well I'd better press on with it.~|~translationMissing
See you anon.~|~translationMissing
Sir Prysin~|~translationMissing
Hello, who are you?~|~translationMissing
I am a mighty adventurer. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I am a mighty adventurer, who are you?~|~translationMissing
I am Sir Prysin. A bold and famous knight of the realm.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure, I was hoping you could tell me.~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you could tell me.~|~translationMissing
Well I've never met you before.~|~translationMissing
(If Demon Slayer is started~|~translationMissing
) Aris said I should come and talk to you.~|~translationMissing
Aris said I should come and talk to you.~|~translationMissing
Aris? Is she still alive? I remember her from when I was pretty young. Well what do you need to talk to me about?~|~translationMissing
I need to find Silverlight.~|~translationMissing
What do you need to find that for?~|~translationMissing
I need it to fight Delrith.~|~translationMissing
Delrith? I thought the world was rid of him, thanks to my great-grandfather.~|~translationMissing
Well, Aris' crystal ball seems to think otherwise.~|~translationMissing
Well Aris' crystal ball seems to think otherwise.~|~translationMissing
Well if the ball says so, I'd better help you.~|~translationMissing
The problem is getting Silverlight.~|~translationMissing
You mean you don't have it?~|~translationMissing
Oh I do have it, but it is so powerful that the king made me put it in a special box which needs three different keys to open it. That way it won't fall into the wrong hands.~|~translationMissing
So give me the keys!~|~translationMissing
Um, well, it's not so easy.~|~translationMissing
I kept one of the keys. I gave the other two to other people for safe keeping.~|~translationMissing
One I gave to Rovin, the captain of the palace guard.~|~translationMissing
I gave the other to the wizard Traiborn.~|~translationMissing
Can you give me your key?~|~translationMissing
Um.... ah....~|~translationMissing
Well there's a problem there as well.~|~translationMissing
I managed to drop the key in the drain just outside the palace kitchen. It is just inside and I can't reach it.~|~translationMissing
So what does the drain lead to?~|~translationMissing
So what does the drain connect to?~|~translationMissing
It is the drain for the drainpipe running from the sink in the kitchen down to the palace sewers.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Captain Rovin?~|~translationMissing
Where does the wizard live?~|~translationMissing
Well I'd better go key hunting.~|~translationMissing
Ok, goodbye.~|~translationMissing
Captain Rovin lives at the top of the guards' quarters in the north-west wing of this palace.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Traiborn?~|~translationMissing
He is one of the wizards who lives in the tower on the little island just off the south coast. I believe his quarters are on the first floor of the tower.~|~translationMissing
And why is this a problem?~|~translationMissing
He's back and unfortunately I've got to deal with him.~|~translationMissing
You don't look up to much. I suppose Silverlight may be good enough to carry you through though.~|~translationMissing
Yes, she is still alive.~|~translationMissing
Yes she is still alive. She lives right outside the castle!~|~translationMissing
Oh, is that the same Aris? I would have thought she would have died by now. She was pretty old when I was a lad.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
So how are you doing with getting the keys?~|~translationMissing
I haven't found any of them yet.~|~translationMissing
Can you remind me where all the keys were again?~|~translationMissing
Ok, tell me when you've got them all.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key from Captain Rovin~|~translationMissing
I've got the key from Captain Rovin.~|~translationMissing
(Same options as before.)~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key from Wizard Traiborn~|~translationMissing
I've got the key from Wizard Traiborn.~|~translationMissing
(Same options as before).)~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key from the drain~|~translationMissing
I've got the key which you dropped down the drain.~|~translationMissing
If the player has keys from Traiborn and Rovin~|~translationMissing
I've got the keys from Wizard Traiborn and Captain Rovin.~|~translationMissing
If the player has keys from Rovin and the drain~|~translationMissing
I've got the key from Captain Rovin and the one that you dropped down the drain.~|~translationMissing
If the player has keys from Traiborn and the drain~|~translationMissing
I've got the key from Wizard Traiborn and the one that you dropped down the drain.~|~translationMissing
Captain Rovin~|~translationMissing
What are you doing up here? Only the palace guards are allowed up here.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I am one of the palace guards.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What about the King?~|~translationMissing
Yes I know, but this is important.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I know, but this is important.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'm listening. Tell me what's so important.~|~translationMissing
There's a demon who wants to invade this city.~|~translationMissing
There's a demon who wants to invade the city.~|~translationMissing
Is it a powerful demon?~|~translationMissing
Not really.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm sure the palace guards can deal with it, then. Thanks for the information.~|~translationMissing
Yes, very.~|~translationMissing
As good as the palace guards are, I don't know if they're up to taking on a very powerful demon.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, the palace guards are rubbish!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, they're--~|~translationMissing
Wait! How dare you insult the palace guards? Get out of my sight!~|~translationMissing
It's not them who are going to fight the demon, it's me.~|~translationMissing
What, all by yourself? How are you going to do that?~|~translationMissing
I'm going to use the powerful sword Silverlight, which I believe you have one of the keys for?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I do. But why should I give it to you?~|~translationMissing
Fortune-teller Aris said I was destined to kill the demon.~|~translationMissing
A fortune-teller? Destiny? I don't believe in that stuff. I got where I am today by hard work, not by destiny! Why should I care what that mad old fortune-teller says?~|~translationMissing
Otherwise the demon will destroy the city!~|~translationMissing
You can't fool me! How do I know you haven't just made that story up to get my key?~|~translationMissing
Sir Prysin said you would give me the key.~|~translationMissing
Oh, he did, did he? Well I don't report to Sir Prysin, I report directly to the king!~|~translationMissing
I didn't work my way up through the ranks of the palace guards so I could take orders from an ill-bred moron who only has his job because his great- grandfather was a hero with a silly name!~|~translationMissing
Why did he give you one of the keys then?~|~translationMissing
Only because the king ordered him to! The king couldn't get Sir Prysin to part with his precious ancestral sword, but he made him lock it up so he couldn't lose it.~|~translationMissing
I got one key and I think some wizard got another. Now what happened to the third one?~|~translationMissing
Sir Prysin dropped it down a drain!~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha! The idiot!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll give you the key, just so that it's you that kills the demon and not Sir Prysin!~|~translationMissing
Captain Rovin hands you a key.~|~translationMissing
Aris said I was destined to kill the demon.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Erm I forgot.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) The castle has just received its ale delivery.~|~translationMissing
Yes, you said before, haven't you killed it yet?~|~translationMissing
Well I'm going to use the powerful sword Silverlight, which I believe you have one of the keys for?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I already gave you my key. Check your pockets.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key in their bank~|~translationMissing
I already gave you my key. Maybe you left it somewhere. Have you checked your bank account?~|~translationMissing
That must be the key Sir Prysin dropped.~|~translationMissing
I don't seem to be able to reach it. I wonder if I can dislodge it somehow. That way it may go down into the sewers.~|~translationMissing
(The player hears a clink.)~|~translationMissing
OK, I think I've washed the key down into the sewer. I'd better go down and get it!~|~translationMissing
You pour the liquid down the drain.~|~translationMissing
Nothing interesting seems to have been dropped down here today.~|~translationMissing
You pick up an old rusty key.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Traiborn~|~translationMissing
Ello young thingummywut.~|~translationMissing
Talk about Demon Slayer.~|~translationMissing
I need to get a key given to you by Sir Prysin.~|~translationMissing
Sir Prysin? Who's that? What would I want his key for?~|~translationMissing
He told me you were looking after it for him.~|~translationMissing
That wasn't very clever of him. I'd lose my head if it wasn't screwed on. Go and tell him to find someone else to look after his valuables in future.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll go and tell him that.~|~translationMissing
Oh that's great, if it wouldn't be too much trouble.~|~translationMissing
Err I'd better be off really.~|~translationMissing
Oh ok, have a good time, and watch out for sheep! They're more cunning than they look.~|~translationMissing
Well, have you got any keys knocking around?~|~translationMissing
He's one of the King's knights.~|~translationMissing
Say, I remember one of the King's knights. He had nice shoes...~|~translationMissing
...and didn't like my homemade spinach rolls. Would you like a spinach roll?~|~translationMissing
Traiborn digs around in the pockets of his robes. After a few moments he triumphantly presents you with a spinach roll.~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much.~|~translationMissing
Just tell me if you have the key.~|~translationMissing
The key? The key to what?~|~translationMissing
There's more than one key in the world don't you know? Would be a bit odd if there was only the one.~|~translationMissing
It's the key to get a sword called Silverlight.~|~translationMissing
Silverlight? Never heard of that. Sounds a good name for a ship. Are you sure it's not the name of a ship rather than a sword?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, pretty sure.~|~translationMissing
That's a pity, waste of a name.~|~translationMissing
You've lost it, haven't you?~|~translationMissing
You've lost it haven't you?~|~translationMissing
Me? Lose things? That's a nasty accusation.~|~translationMissing
Now you come to mention it, yes I do have a key. It's in my special closet of valuable stuff. Now how do I get into that?~|~translationMissing
I sealed it using one of my magic rituals. So it would make sense that another ritual would open it again.~|~translationMissing
So do you know what ritual to use?~|~translationMissing
Let me think a second.~|~translationMissing
Yes a simple drazier style ritual should suffice. Hmm, main problem with that is I'll need 25 sets of bones. Now where am I going to get hold of something like that?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that's too bad. I really need that key.~|~translationMissing
Ah well, sorry I couldn't be any more help.~|~translationMissing
I'll get the bones for you.~|~translationMissing
I'll help get the bones for you.~|~translationMissing
Ooh that would be very good of you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll speak to you when I've got some bones.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing finding bones?~|~translationMissing
I haven't got any at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Nevermind, keep working on it.~|~translationMissing
I have some bones.~|~translationMissing
Give 'em here then.~|~translationMissing
You give Traiborn [X] set of bones.~|~translationMissing
That's all of them.~|~translationMissing
I still need [25-X] more.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll keep looking.~|~translationMissing
You give Traiborn [X] sets of bones.~|~translationMissing
Hurrah! That's all 25 sets of bones.~|~translationMissing
(A weird-looking wardrobe pops out from the ground.)~|~translationMissing
Traiborn hands you a key.~|~translationMissing
Not a problem for a friend of Sir What's-his-face.~|~translationMissing
Don't you have somewhere to be, young thingummywut? You still have that key you asked me for.~|~translationMissing
You're right. I've got a demon to slay.~|~translationMissing
I've lost the key you gave to me.~|~translationMissing
Yes I know, it was returned to me. If you want it back you're going to have to collect another 25 sets of bones.~|~translationMissing
I've got all three keys!~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Now I can give you Silverlight.~|~translationMissing
(Sir Prysin walks to the sword case, unlocks it and hands the player Silverlight. If the door is closed the player will teleport inside. The sword shines in the player's hands.)~|~translationMissing
That sword belonged to my great-grandfather. Make sure you treat it with respect!~|~translationMissing
Now go kill that demon!~|~translationMissing
How goes the quest?~|~translationMissing
I found Sir Prysin. Unfortunately I haven't got the sword yet. He's made it complicated for me.~|~translationMissing
Ok, hurry, we haven't much time.~|~translationMissing
Have you sorted that demon out yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. And I, um, lost Silverlight.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I know, someone returned it to me. Take better care of it this time.~|~translationMissing
I have the sword now. I just need to kill the demon, I think.~|~translationMissing
Yep, that's right.~|~translationMissing
Well I'd better press on with it~|~translationMissing
Where can I find the demon?~|~translationMissing
Just head south and you should find the stone circle just outside the city gate.~|~translationMissing
The player entered the stone circle south of Varrock with Silverlight~|~translationMissing
Denath~|~translationMissing
Arise, O mighty Delrith! Bring destruction to this soft, weak city!~|~translationMissing
Dark wizards~|~translationMissing
Arise, Delrith!~|~translationMissing
The wizards cast an evil spell...~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha! At last you are free, my demonic brother! Rest now, and then have your revenge on this pitiful city!~|~translationMissing
Dark wizard~|~translationMissing
Noo! Not Silverlight! Delrith is not ready yet!~|~translationMissing
I've got to get out of here...~|~translationMissing
I'd better wield Silverlight first.~|~translationMissing
Delrith is weakened and no longer attacking.~|~translationMissing
Now what was that incantation again?~|~translationMissing
The following five words in the order from earlier on.~|~translationMissing
[word 1]...~|~translationMissing
[word 2]...~|~translationMissing
[word 3]...~|~translationMissing
[word 4]...~|~translationMissing
[word 5]!~|~translationMissing
If the player incorrectly selects the five words~|~translationMissing
The vortex collapses. That was the wrong incantation.~|~translationMissing
Delrith heals to full Hitpoints and continues fighting~|~translationMissing
If the player correctly selects the five words~|~translationMissing
Delrith is sucked into the vortex...~|~translationMissing
...back into the dark dimension from which he came.~|~translationMissing
Delrith is sucked into a portal, saving the entire world.~|~translationMissing

What would you like to talk about?~|~translationMissing
Ask about the Desert Treasure quest.~|~translationMissing
Terry Balando~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Was that translation any use to Asgarnia?~|~translationMissing
I think it was, thanks!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask about the Digsite quest.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I represent the Museum of Varrock, and I have reason to believe there may be some kinds of artefacts of historical significance in the nearby area...~|~translationMissing
Eblis~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. The only time people care about our existence is when they think they have something to gain from us.~|~translationMissing
I have nothing to say to you. You and your kind are not welcome here.~|~translationMissing
Please, if I can just have a few minutes of your time to ask some questions...?~|~translationMissing
(sigh) I suppose I can spare you that. What do you wish to know about?~|~translationMissing
Why is this village so hostile?~|~translationMissing
Why are all of the people here so hostile? You would think I was asking you for money instead of just for answers to a few questions...~|~translationMissing
It is a long story, and I doubt you have much interest in hearing it. Your sort never are, you just take what you can of ours, and then abandon us once more to the desert.~|~translationMissing
No, I want to hear this story.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'd be quite interested to hear what it is you have to say to excuse the attitude everybody in this village seems to have.~|~translationMissing
Ah, it all begun many generations ago, when our ancestors were the proud rulers of these lands...~|~translationMissing
My ancestors lived far to the North of here, and our lands stretched from the sea in the East to the river Lum, and the mountain of ice. From coast to coast, North to South, our domain was absolute.~|~translationMissing
Our god was kind to us, and blessed us with prosperity and happiness, and in return we were merciless to his enemies wherever we found them.~|~translationMissing
Then came the betrayal.~|~translationMissing
Our god was banished, leaving us helpless to our fates.~|~translationMissing
Without his protection, we were forced to fend for ourselves once more, against the enemies that sought to destroy us through their petty jealousies.~|~translationMissing
But we did not succumb without fighting! The spiteful Saradomin and pathetic Zamorak warred with each other, but the hatred they had for each other was as nothing to the hatred they held towards us!~|~translationMissing
With each battle they waged, we lost more and more land, unable to fight on all fronts, and were pushed further and further South into this gods-forsaken desert.~|~translationMissing
Our greatest hero, Azzanadra, was finally trapped in a strange stone structure to the South of here, and bound within by terrible powers...~|~translationMissing
And with that our lands, our homes, our very lives were stolen from us! Too weak to reclaim what was rightfully ours, we made our homes here, knowing that someday Azzanadra will~|~translationMissing
return with his magnificent power, and bring us back to our former glory...~|~translationMissing
So you're upset because of something that happened hundreds of years ago?~|~translationMissing
Seems to me like maybe you should find some closure, and let the past go...~|~translationMissing
The insults heaped upon my race will never be forgotten, will never be forgiven and will never again be overlooked.~|~translationMissing
Someday, a harsh wind will blow upon this land, uncovering the wrongs of the past, and we will get back what is rightfully ours. Until such a day we will bide our time here, and will~|~translationMissing
always be ready with our blades for our righteous vengeance.~|~translationMissing
I don't care about your story.~|~translationMissing
I don't really care what your story is to be honest, there is no excuse for such rudeness or hostility.~|~translationMissing
I have done nothing wrong to you, but everybody here treats me like I have committed some great crime against the village.~|~translationMissing
That is because, from our point of view, you have.~|~translationMissing
What? Just because I entered your village?~|~translationMissing
You have no right to be here! You have no right to the life you have, for it was taken at our expense!~|~translationMissing
Whatever... No wonder all you loonies live out here in the desert by yourselves.~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about treasure near here?~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you knew anything about some treasure somewhere around here?~|~translationMissing
I have some evidence that there might be some kind of treasure hidden very close to this village...~|~translationMissing
If I knew of any treasure I would not choose to spend my life in this gods-forsaken desert.~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about a fortress near here?~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about some kind of fortress nearby? I have reason to believe there is, or at least used to be, some kind of fortress very close to here...~|~translationMissing
Nobody would build anything in this wasteland unless they were forced to, to survive.~|~translationMissing
I know of no fortress, I know of no reason why anyone would ever bother doing anything out here in the desert.~|~translationMissing
Tell me of The four diamonds of Azzanadra~|~translationMissing
So tell me... Did you ever hear of something called the Diamonds of Azzanadra?~|~translationMissing
This is the treasure which you seek???~|~translationMissing
Please accept my apologies noble sir! I thought you were but some opportunistic thief, looking to steal what heritage we have left! Now I see that you are in fact a brave adventurer,~|~translationMissing
looking to restore our glories back upon us!~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah... So anyway, you have heard of them?~|~translationMissing
Heard of them? Of course I have heard of them! They are the legacy of our greatest ever hero!~|~translationMissing
So... do you have any idea where they might be? I have a feeling they will be very valuable.~|~translationMissing
Uh, valuable as historical artefacts I mean, obviously.~|~translationMissing
They were stolen by warriors of the false god Zamorak generations ago. When you find the warriors, you will find the diamonds.~|~translationMissing
I suspect they will not willingly part with such objects of power however.~|~translationMissing
How do you mean?~|~translationMissing
Each diamond has an elemental quality...~|~translationMissing
There is the Diamond of Blood, the Diamond of Ice, the Diamond of Smoke and the Diamond of Shadow.~|~translationMissing
You should expect the warriors to have taken some aspect of these diamonds as their own...~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea how I could track down these warriors somehow, then?~|~translationMissing
There is an ancient spell I know of that may spy upon such power... But it will require a few ingredients for it to work.~|~translationMissing
Should you be willing to get these ingredients for me, I will be able to locate the rough area where each of these warriors has taken refuge. The spell is imprecise, but it should help you get on the~|~translationMissing
right track in your search.~|~translationMissing
Is your desire for our freedom strong enough? Will you gather the ingredients for this spell for me?~|~translationMissing
Sure, what do you need?~|~translationMissing
For this spell, I will need to make some scrying glasses. I will need enough so that we can view the realm in its entirety.~|~translationMissing
When enchanted, the scrying glass will be able to let us view any area that has been influenced by the presence of the Diamonds of Azzanadra.~|~translationMissing
Okay, but what exactly do you need for this spell?~|~translationMissing
Well, six scrying glasses should be sufficient. For each scrying glass, I will need two magic logs, a steel bar and some molten glass. This makes a total of 12 magic logs, 6 pieces of molten~|~translationMissing
glass, and 6 steel bars.~|~translationMissing
In addition, for the actual spell to enchant the glasses, I will require one set of normal bones, some ash, some charcoal and a single blood rune.~|~translationMissing
Do you understand me, adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Standard bones. Other types of bones are of no use to me in this spell.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I will go get those for you.~|~translationMissing
It's a slightly odd collection of ingredients, but I shouldn't have too much trouble getting those for you.~|~translationMissing
No, please repeat those ingredients.~|~translationMissing
Nothing thanks.~|~translationMissing
Actually, there was nothing I really wanted to ask you about.~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is exactly like your sort to waste my time in such a way.~|~translationMissing
Archaeologist~|~translationMissing
Hello again. How's the treasure hunting going?~|~translationMissing
Well, I've found four diamonds.~|~translationMissing
What? But you've been gone ages!~|~translationMissing
C'mon, you can be square with me, you must have found more treasure than just four measly diamonds by now!~|~translationMissing
No, I really haven't.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Well, okay a deal is a deal. Hand two of them over.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I think I'm going to need them to gain access to the real treasure...~|~translationMissing
REALLY? Great, I love treasure!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about two measly diamonds if you think they'll lead to something better!~|~translationMissing
I don't usually get out of bed for less than a hundred gold certs!~|~translationMissing
I used the Four Diamonds on the pillars surrounding the pyramid...~|~translationMissing
Yes? And what happened?~|~translationMissing
Er... they changed colour.~|~translationMissing
Ah, that was the power being re-absorbed back into them. That should have been sufficient to break the magic seal preventing anyone exiting or entering the structure.~|~translationMissing
Quickly, you must let Lord Azzanadra know that he is free again after these many years!~|~translationMissing
Please, when you have freed Azzanadra, let me know what words he has for his faithful followers...~|~translationMissing
Hello again, apprentice archaeologist. How's the treasure hunting going?~|~translationMissing
Well... I found four diamonds...~|~translationMissing
Great! Pass me my share, and it's a good job all around!~|~translationMissing
Um... sorry, I can't.~|~translationMissing
Huh? You're not trying to break a deal here are ya???~|~translationMissing
No, it's just... There were these weird pillars around this pyramid...~|~translationMissing
Um... Well...~|~translationMissing
They kind of... ate the diamonds...~|~translationMissing
Pyramid columns ate your diamonds?~|~translationMissing
That's a crazy story kid. Why would you go putting diamonds into them in the first place anyway? Diamonds!~|~translationMissing
Of all things!~|~translationMissing
Well, I have this feeling there is some better treasure inside that pyramid, and I needed to put the diamonds in to gain entrance.~|~translationMissing
Well what are you wasting time talking to me for?~|~translationMissing
Go get me some treasure, pal!~|~translationMissing
So have you spoken to my Lord Azzanadra yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes I have.~|~translationMissing
And what words did he have for his followers?~|~translationMissing
Er... He didn't really mention you at all, but he did teach me some cool new magic spells.~|~translationMissing
It is understandable perhaps... His poor mind must be addled after all of those years of confinement, he would not willingly ignore his followers...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, if he has taught you our ancient magics, you may be interested in purchasing an ancient heirloom that was passed down to me. My ancestor fought in the ancient battles using the~|~translationMissing
magic of our god. This heirloom will help you with the speed of your spell-casting.~|~translationMissing
Normally I could not bear to part with such a priceless relic, but for your help in freeing my Lord Azzanadra, I will be prepared to sell it to you for a mere 80,000 gold.~|~translationMissing
Are you interested?~|~translationMissing
Yes please~|~translationMissing
Take care of it, it is the only heirloom from those times I possess, although rumour has it many of our ancient warriors were buried with identical weapons so that they could continue to fight for my Lord in their deaths.~|~translationMissing
No thanks~|~translationMissing
As you wish. Bear my offer in mind should you ever change your decision, I will remain here.~|~translationMissing
Have you got any symbols of your god?~|~translationMissing
I'll leave you to it.~|~translationMissing
Eblis gives you a little signet. Its shape matches the icon you saw on the altar in the pyramid.~|~translationMissing
Greetings. I await the return of my Lord Azzanadra and of our god. I do not know why, but I feel this spot has some significance...~|~translationMissing

Start the Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire quest?~|~translationMissing
If the player is on the Ancient Magicks spellbook~|~translationMissing
You can feel the distinct energy of Ancient Magicks emanating from the door. You reach out and touch it. The symbol on the door starts to glow in response...~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. The player is inside the vault, and Asgarnia Smith appears, following the player inside.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand... How?~|~translationMissing
If the player is on another spellbook~|~translationMissing
You can feel the distinct energy of Ancient Magicks emanating from the door. You reach out and touch it, but nothing happens.~|~translationMissing
Hey, I know you! You're that archaeologist! What was your name again...?~|~translationMissing
You don't remember my name?! You don't remember the world famous Asgarnia Smith, archaeologist extraordinaire?~|~translationMissing
No... sorry. It's not a very memorable name.~|~translationMissing
All that work we did together, and you don't even remember my name.~|~translationMissing
To be fair, we never really did that much work together. You sent me on a treasure hunt, but you never really contributed much yourself.~|~translationMissing
And a good job I didn't! I never saw a single ounce of gold from that partnership.~|~translationMissing
Well if a partnership with me was so disappointing, how come you're here?~|~translationMissing
Bah, I'm not here for you, kid. I'm here for treasure!~|~translationMissing
After our last escapade turned out to be pointless, I set out in search of a new adventure! I started off on Karamja, but that didn't really go anywhere...~|~translationMissing
In the end, I came back to the desert and dug up this place! I've spent ages trying to work out how to get in, only for you to walk up and open the door right away!~|~translationMissing
Yeah... funny that. They opened for me because of some magical abilities I gained on our last treasure hunt. You know, that one you were saying was pointless.~|~translationMissing
Huh... Well, who'd have thought...~|~translationMissing
Alright then, kid, I'll tell you what... You didn't find us any proper treasure last time around, so now's your chance to redeem yourself!~|~translationMissing
I'm sure this place is the key to finding riches beyond imagination, and I, Asgarnia Smith, am willing to enter into a partnership with you, er...~|~translationMissing
You don't remember my name either, do you? It's [player name].~|~translationMissing
Yes, as I was saying, I, Asgarnia Smith, am willing to enter into a partnership with you, [player name], to uncover those riches!~|~translationMissing
Who knows, perhaps you'll even learn a thing or two from a master treasure hun- I mean, a master archaeologist like me.~|~translationMissing
And I am willing to offer you an exclusive rate of a forty percent split!~|~translationMissing
Fifty percent.~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! A forty-five percent split! So, kid, what do you say?~|~translationMissing
How about I look around while I think about it?~|~translationMissing
Well, kid, any thoughts on my offer?~|~translationMissing
I'm still looking around. I'll decide once I know a bit more about what this place is.~|~translationMissing
Of course! Take as much time as you need, as long as you don't take long.~|~translationMissing
The statue looks like it's meant to be holding something. A plaque on it reads~|~translationMissing
'The Whisperer'~|~translationMissing
'Carnifex Maximus Vardorvis'~|~translationMissing
'Praefectus Classis Perseriya'~|~translationMissing
'Duke Sucellus of the Sixth Legion'~|~translationMissing
Do you not want to hear about what I've found first?~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes, go ahead!~|~translationMissing
According to that plaque over there, this place is a vault that was built to protect the 'mighty treasures' of the 'Empty Lord' from 'the soulless betrayers'.~|~translationMissing
Mighty treasures, you say? Fantastic! Any idea how to access them?~|~translationMissing
I'm guessing it has something to do with these statues. It looks like each of them is meant to be holding something.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so we need to find whatever it is they should be holding. Classic treasure vault puzzle! Where do you plan to start?~|~translationMissing
Well hang on there. I haven't actually agreed to anything yet.~|~translationMissing
But surely you can't turn down an opportunity like this! You said it yourself~|~translationMissing
Mighty treasures!~|~translationMissing
Mighty treasures that we can't access.~|~translationMissing
Now look here, kid. You won't get far in life with an attitude like that. Is there really nothing else we have to go on?~|~translationMissing
We have four names~|~translationMissing
Vardorvis, Perseriya, Duke Sucellus and the Whisperer.~|~translationMissing
They sound like pretty solid leads to me. If we can find these four individuals, maybe we can also find whatever it is we need to get to the treasure.~|~translationMissing
That's a big 'if' right there. This vault is clearly Zarosian, which means whoever these four are, they're from thousands of years ago. They're probably all long- dead now.~|~translationMissing
Zarosian? I'm sure I've heard that term before...~|~translationMissing
Ah yes! Those recent discoveries at the Digsite! I bet my good friend Terry Balando can help. Why don't you talk to him?~|~translationMissing
Again, I've not actually agreed to help.~|~translationMissing
No, but you're going to. I can tell. The thrill of the adventure is too much to resist. Not to mention that thirty percent split!~|~translationMissing
So we're agreed? Excellent! You'll find Terry at the Digsite Exam Centre. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
*sigh*~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, kid. Did you speak to Terry Balando?~|~translationMissing
You know I still haven't agreed to help you, right?~|~translationMissing
You'll find Terry at the Digsite Exam Centre. You'd best get going. There's treasure to uncover!~|~translationMissing
Hello again. How goes the archaeology?~|~translationMissing
Pretty good, thanks. In fact, I've come across something I was hoping you could help me with.~|~translationMissing
I came across something very interesting down in the desert~|~translationMissing
A Zarosian vault.~|~translationMissing
Zarosian? Like that artefact you found for us?~|~translationMissing
Exactly! I'm hoping to learn about four names I discovered on statues within the vault.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like an exciting discovery, but I'm afraid I can't help. This 'Zaros' is still mostly a mystery to me. In fact, I'd say you probably know more than I do!~|~translationMissing
So what would you suggest?~|~translationMissing
Well you may well be in luck. We had a new arrival at the Digsite recently who claims to be a Zarosian expert!~|~translationMissing
Quite impressive for one of those to exist considering the greatest historians and archaeologists in the world has no knowledge on Zaros until very recently...~|~translationMissing
Interesting... Where can I find this expert?~|~translationMissing
He's set up a new dig on the eastern edge of the Digsite. You're looking for... Ah, what was his name again...~|~translationMissing
Nabanik? No, that's not right...~|~translationMissing
Banikan! You'll be wanting to speak to Dr Banikan!~|~translationMissing
Great! I'll head over there and see if I can find him.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Did you speak to Dr Banikan?~|~translationMissing
He's set up a new dig on the eastern edge of the Digsite. You'll likely find him there.~|~translationMissing
Dr Banikan~|~translationMissing
Oh... Good day, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Dr Banikan, I presume?~|~translationMissing
Banikan? Yes... I am Banikan.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? You don't seem very sure...~|~translationMissing
My apologies. I was not expecting company down here, so you caught me a bit off guard.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... We haven't met before, have we? You seem familiar.~|~translationMissing
I don't believe so.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Fair enough.~|~translationMissing
So tell me, adventurer, what brings you down here?~|~translationMissing
I've been told you're a Zarosian expert. I was hoping you could help me with some names.~|~translationMissing
Names? What names?~|~translationMissing
Vardorvis, Perseriya, Duke Sucellus and the Whisperer. I believe they were all Zarosians.~|~translationMissing
Where did you hear these names?~|~translationMissing
I found a strange vault down in the desert, on the eastern coast. The names were on four statues inside.~|~translationMissing
A Zarosian vault? How curious...~|~translationMissing
So can you help?~|~translationMissing
I think so. I suspect the information you seek can be found in the very place I'm searching for.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Where's that?~|~translationMissing
You seem to be fairly knowledgeable when it comes to the Zarosian Empire, which is quite a rarity these days. How much do you know about its fall?~|~translationMissing
I know that Zaros was overthrown by one of his most trusted generals, Zamorak, who became a god as a result.~|~translationMissing
Spot on! You could teach the so-called experts around here a thing or two. The betrayal of Zaros ultimately led to the God Wars, making it quite possibly the most pivotal moment in all of history.~|~translationMissing
However, even to those of us who do know our stuff, much of what happened to the empire following Zaros' defeat is still a mystery. That's why I'm here.~|~translationMissing
Senntisten, the Zarosian settlement once located here, was believed to be the capital of the empire.~|~translationMissing
If my research is right, and I have strong reason to believe it is, the remains of a key military installation are located right beneath us.~|~translationMissing
I can definitely think of worse places to discover details on the fall of the empire.~|~translationMissing
And you think this military installation could have information on the four names I found?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! Any respectable military outpost would have been filled to the brim with key strategic intelligence. I'd expect details on notable Zarosians to be included.~|~translationMissing
Of course, they wouldn't have wanted that information falling into the wrong hands, so recovering it may not be straightforward...~|~translationMissing
Well I do love a good challenge.~|~translationMissing
Glad to hear it. Now, I have made good progress in excavating these ruins so far, but perhaps you can help me with the final step?~|~translationMissing
Sounds like something I'd be good at! What do you need me to blow up?~|~translationMissing
Excuse me?~|~translationMissing
Well, my first major discovery here involved me blowing a big hole in some rocks to access an ancient temple. Shouldn't be too hard to do that again.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, what?~|~translationMissing
What's the problem?~|~translationMissing
You risked the structural integrity of an ancient temple by blowing it open with explosives?!~|~translationMissing
Huh... I guess I never thought about it like that before. Yeah... now that you mention it, that was really quite a stupid idea.~|~translationMissing
How about we take just a touch more care with this one?~|~translationMissing
Good idea. What do you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
Grab yourself a pickaxe and carefully clear away these rocks. There should be a pickaxe in the crate in the corner.~|~translationMissing
Okay, will do.~|~translationMissing
So how come you know so much about Zaros?~|~translationMissing
Well... in my travels, I ended up spending a great deal of time in one of the few places Zarosian remnants can still be found. My time studying them filled me with fascination, and sadness.~|~translationMissing
Sadness?~|~translationMissing
'I walked across the sands and saw the ruins of time...'~|~translationMissing
It's an old poem about the rise, and inevitable fall, of kingdoms and empires. Once, Zaros' Empire stretched as far as the eye could see. Now, no one even remembers his name.~|~translationMissing
To think that something that was once so absolute may soon be lost forever... It falls to people like me, and perhaps you as well, to ensure that history isn't forgotten.~|~translationMissing
What is it you're searching for here?~|~translationMissing
As I said, I hope to find details about the fall of the Zarosian Empire.~|~translationMissing
Anything in particular though?~|~translationMissing
I have a few leads. Details on individuals and artefacts that may have played a key role in the final days of the Empire.~|~translationMissing
Do you think my four names could be connected?~|~translationMissing
I'd say it's definitely possible. I suppose there's only one way to find out.~|~translationMissing
I'd best get to work.~|~translationMissing
That's the rocks cleared.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work. Shall we head in?~|~translationMissing
I'll go in first and make sure it's safe. I'll call you down when you're good to join me.~|~translationMissing
I appreciate your concern for my safety. Very well, I will await your call.~|~translationMissing
Is it safe for me to head below?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'll call you down when you're good to join me.~|~translationMissing
Okay, you're good to come down now.~|~translationMissing
So what was all that noise I heard?~|~translationMissing
It was some sort of ancient golem. I'm guessing it was here to guard the place. Don't worry, I dealt with it.~|~translationMissing
I may have destroyed it...~|~translationMissing
What is it with you and destroying things?~|~translationMissing
It's kind of what I do.~|~translationMissing
Well let's try and keep the destruction to a minimum from now on. If we're to discover anything down here, we'll need some things still intact.~|~translationMissing
And on that note, we should take a look around.~|~translationMissing
This place is remarkable! Let's have a look around and see what we can find.~|~translationMissing
Look at this.~|~translationMissing
A golem? Fascinating... Is this like the one that was defending this place?~|~translationMissing
It's very similar. Doesn't look like this one will be doing much fighting though.~|~translationMissing
No. It seems to have been heavily modified in some way. I wonder...~|~translationMissing
Golems do have rudimentary intelligence. Maybe we can get some information out of it.~|~translationMissing
We'll need to power it up I guess. Let me see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
You take a closer look at the golem. It has an 8x8 grid of slots on the back. An inscription above the grid reads~|~translationMissing
'Requires eight cells to achieve the correct power level.'~|~translationMissing
Hmm... This altar could be of interest.~|~translationMissing
It may be of little use in its current state. It doesn't seem to be giving off any magical energy.~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't have expected an archaeologist to be a magical expert. Do you practice magic much?~|~translationMissing
I've dabbled.~|~translationMissing
I think it's working!~|~translationMissing
Looks like it. Excellent work.~|~translationMissing
Golem~|~translationMissing
Please specify a search term.~|~translationMissing
Er... What?~|~translationMissing
I guess you should do as it asks.~|~translationMissing
The player is prompted to input a term.~|~translationMissing
Checking...~|~translationMissing
If the term is invalid~|~translationMissing
Error~|~translationMissing
No data found.~|~translationMissing
Please specify another search term.~|~translationMissing
If the term is valid but inaccesible, or if the player searches for the term "Frostenhorn" before Dr Banikan does~|~translationMissing
Access to data denied.~|~translationMissing
If the term is valid and accesible~|~translationMissing
Data found. Outputting now.~|~translationMissing
An interface opens showing the data.~|~translationMissing
Do you wish to specify another search term?~|~translationMissing
Azzanadra?~|~translationMissing
A Mahjarrat. I encountered him in the Kharidian Desert.~|~translationMissing
Not many people can say they've met a Mahjarrat. Some don't even believe they exist.~|~translationMissing
I've actually come across a fair few.~|~translationMissing
Really? How curious...~|~translationMissing
Lassar... One of the old Zarosian fortresses, built atop Ice Mountain.~|~translationMissing
It was supposedly defined by its beautiful shining spires...~|~translationMissing
Well those spires are long gone, but I wonder if there might be some traces left below...~|~translationMissing
Camdozaal. This golem here looks suspiciously like the ones I've seen there.~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course. We know that Saradominists built a new city over the top of Senntisten. It's quite possible the dwarves did the same at Lassar.~|~translationMissing
A few of the other archaeologists recently set up a dig in Camdozaal. Perhaps they'll have found something of note.~|~translationMissing
Lovakengj? As in the Great Kourend Lovakengj?~|~translationMissing
I can't imagine there's many others.~|~translationMissing
I've never been myself, but I do remember one of the other archaeologists, Elissa I think is her name, saying she'd visited Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
I suspect she probably didn't encounter this Vardorvis while there.~|~translationMissing
No, I imagine not. Still, from what she was saying, it sounded like she did spend time researching the history of the local area.~|~translationMissing
I suppose there's worse places to start.~|~translationMissing
Battle for the Eye? I've never heard of it.~|~translationMissing
I think I know what it's referring to. There was a great battle at the Temple of the Eye long ago. A rift to the Abyss was opened as a result.~|~translationMissing
The Abyss? I've only ever heard legends of the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
What did the legends say?~|~translationMissing
Nothing good.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... sounds about right.~|~translationMissing
Informal command? Seems this Duke was quite important.~|~translationMissing
And unless the Zarosians had two prisons of the same name, I think I know where the entry to this one is.~|~translationMissing
You do?~|~translationMissing
Yes. It's in a dungeon under Weiss. I had quite the adventure there not too long ago.~|~translationMissing
Well I think that's all the information I needed.~|~translationMissing
And quite the glut of information it was. So I suppose you intend to try and discover what happened to these four individuals?~|~translationMissing
Do you think that's a good idea?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! You have an opportunity here to uncover some lost history of the Zarosian Empire. You can't say no to that.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll be sure to let you know if I find anything interesting.~|~translationMissing
I'd appreciate that. Anyway, time to see if this golem has what I'm after as well...~|~translationMissing
Dr Banikan uses the golem to search for something.~|~translationMissing
Find what you wanted?~|~translationMissing
Yes and no. It's not the definitive information I was hoping for, but at least it rules out some options.~|~translationMissing
I need to consult with a good friend of mine on this. Forgive me, but he lives quite far from here, so best I don't delay.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for your help, adventurer. I hope we meet again soon.~|~translationMissing
Dr Banikan departs.~|~translationMissing
I wonder what it was that he was searching for...~|~translationMissing
Repeat last search.~|~translationMissing
Elissa~|~translationMissing
I hear you visited Lovakengj recently.~|~translationMissing
That's right. Why do you ask?~|~translationMissing
I'm trying to learn more about a vampyre called Vardorvis. Apparently he travelled to the west long ago in pursuit of someone called Yonrith Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
A vampyre? This must have been a very long time ago.~|~translationMissing
Back when Senntisten still stood, it seems.~|~translationMissing
Oh wow, that is a long time! You're talking about a time before Great Kourend even existed!~|~translationMissing
Indeed. I was wondering if during your travels there, you came across any details about Vardorvis or Yonrith?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... You say this vampyre was in pursuit of Yonrith?~|~translationMissing
Well... it could be nothing, but there's this monument in Lovakengj called the Burning Man. Apparently, it represents the defeat of an ancient evil. Could be a good place to start?~|~translationMissing
Definitely sounds worth a look.~|~translationMissing
You'll find it in western Lovakengj. It's pretty hard to miss!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Sorry, I need to go.~|~translationMissing
Barus~|~translationMissing
Hello! Here to see the Burning Man?~|~translationMissing
Well you picked a great day for it! The name's Barus by the way. I work as a historian here. Those Arceuus lot may think they know it all, but I reckon I could tell you a thing or two that even they haven't realised!~|~translationMissing
Well on that note, what can you tell me about the Burning Man?~|~translationMissing
The Burning Man is a monument to a great triumph in Lovakengj history. We're talking thosands[sic] of years ago, before Kourend was even a kingdom! Sadly, that does mean some details have been lost to time.~|~translationMissing
What we do know is that a great evil threatened the earliest dwarven settlers here. Had that evil prevailed, Lovakengj might never have existed!~|~translationMissing
Thankfully, with guidance from their brave leader, the settlers were able to overcome this evil! The Burning Man is a reminder of that.~|~translationMissing
So I'm guessing the monument represents this evil?~|~translationMissing
That's right!~|~translationMissing
But what was it, and where did it come from?~|~translationMissing
Ah, now that bit is less clear. Have you heard of the Stranglewood?~|~translationMissing
Not too surprising. It's not a place you'd want to visit. Anyway, that's supposedly where this evil emerged from.~|~translationMissing
I see. What can you tell me about the Stranglewood?~|~translationMissing
You'll find it on the border between the Kebos Lowlands and the Kingdom of Varlamore. It's a cursed place. Few have ever entered, and of those that have, none have returned!~|~translationMissing
You know, I heard some chap from Hosidius went missing not too long ago. They reckon he went exploring the Stranglewood. Poor guy.~|~translationMissing
Who was he?~|~translationMissing
Some botanist I think. His name escapes me, but I think he lived just south of the Hosidius Estate Agent.~|~translationMissing
Interesting... Thanks for all the information.~|~translationMissing
Don't mention it!~|~translationMissing
Hello again!~|~translationMissing
Hello! Where did you say that botanist lived?~|~translationMissing
If I remember right, he lived just south of the Hosidius Estate Agent.~|~translationMissing
Perfect! Thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
This Stranglewood place is supposed to be really dangerous. I should probably get myself some sort of protection before heading there.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins in which the player enters the ruins of the Stranglewood, and encounters a horde of strangled.~|~translationMissing
Ah...~|~translationMissing
I'm just going to quietly go over here now.~|~translationMissing
The player walks towards the nearest building, stepping on a tendril and climbing over a barricade.~|~translationMissing
That was a close one.~|~translationMissing
A disheveled man named Kasonde will walk towards you.~|~translationMissing
Kasonde~|~translationMissing
And who on Gielinor are you?~|~translationMissing
Well? Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm [player name], and you are?~|~translationMissing
I think you already know the answer to that.~|~translationMissing
Er... Do I?~|~translationMissing
Shaw. Kasonde Shaw. Don't go acting like you haven't been following me for some time now.~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course. Those old ruins.~|~translationMissing
Exactly. Perhaps you took me for a fool, but I was on to you from the start. Considering what we learnt, I knew it was only a matter of time before you showed up.~|~translationMissing
You mean soul transference? Not actually something that interests me, to be honest.~|~translationMissing
Don't take me for a fool! If you had no interest in the Old Ones' secrets, why would you have followed me to those ruins? And why would you have come here?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I didn't even know what an Old One was. I still don't really. I was just exploring when I found your camp.~|~translationMissing
As for why I'm here, I'm looking for information about someone called Vardorvis.~|~translationMissing
Really? You want me to believe that all of this is a coincidence?~|~translationMissing
Well... yes.~|~translationMissing
You're lying! You're lying and...~|~translationMissing
Hang on... do you hear that?~|~translationMissing
Hear what?~|~translationMissing
The Strangled! Did you disturb any tendrils on your way in here?~|~translationMissing
I may have...?~|~translationMissing
They'll be coming. We've got no chance up here. Head down below! Now!~|~translationMissing
What are you waiting for? They're coming! Quick, head down below!~|~translationMissing
That's the lot of them. Let's head back up.~|~translationMissing
That was too close. You nearly got us both killed!~|~translationMissing
I don't understand... What are those things? Are they zombies?~|~translationMissing
You really want me to believe that you don't know anything about this place?~|~translationMissing
I already told you, I wasn't lying.~|~translationMissing
Well I don't have any reason to trust that.~|~translationMissing
With how dangerous this place is, do you really have a choice?~|~translationMissing
Alright, fine. But I have no desire to see you get us killed, so you'd better wisen up fast.~|~translationMissing
I'm listening.~|~translationMissing
It all starts with the Old Ones. They lived here long before humans came to these lands, and these ruins here were once their home.~|~translationMissing
And these Old Ones discovered soul transference?~|~translationMissing
They did, and they did so long before House Arceuus even existed. It was their final attempt to overcome their extinction, but they failed.~|~translationMissing
What you see around you is the result of their failure. It's known as the Strangler.~|~translationMissing
The Strangler?~|~translationMissing
It's some sort of parasite. It was presumably meant to play a role in their transference rituals, but instead it destroyed them. It has remained here ever since.~|~translationMissing
Hence the Strangled?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. Plenty of unwary fools have fallen victim to the Strangler. If you don't take care, you will share their fate.~|~translationMissing
So how do we deal with them?~|~translationMissing
The trick is to maintain your distance. They're relatively passive unless you get too close, but if you disturb one, the rest will quickly come running.~|~translationMissing
If you need to fight one, try to do it away from the rest!~|~translationMissing
And stay off of the tendrils! You'll alert the lot of them to your location! It's like a network.~|~translationMissing
Keep my distance and stay off the tendrils. I can do that. So what's our next move?~|~translationMissing
The fact that you're still alive tells me you broke into my home and stole some of the potion I made.~|~translationMissing
'Broke in' is maybe a bit strong...~|~translationMissing
Call it what you want, it's not important now. What is important is that I believe I can make a more powerful potion using ingredients found here.~|~translationMissing
If all goes well, this potion will provide increased immunity against the Strangler. If either of us are to find what we want here, it will be essential.~|~translationMissing
So what ingredients do we need?~|~translationMissing
As you've no doubt seen, the Strangler infects plant life as well. However, I've come across a small number of plants that seem to have developed immunity.~|~translationMissing
First, there's a herb growing atop the cliff just north west of the temple. Second, there are some berries in an old camp on the coast to the south west.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I can gather those.~|~translationMissing
I need to gather some additional ingredients from within the temple. I will meet you back here once I'm done.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Kasonde must still be at the temple. Guess I should go and see if he needs a hand.~|~translationMissing
Kasonde! Are you okay?~|~translationMissing
Damn it! Damn it! This can't happen! It can't!~|~translationMissing
Kasonde?~|~translationMissing
Kasonde shows you his arm. There's a large bite from one of the Strangled.~|~translationMissing
Kasonde...~|~translationMissing
It's fine! This doesn't change anything.~|~translationMissing
But the infection...~|~translationMissing
The infection means nothing!~|~translationMissing
I was a dead man either way...~|~translationMissing
Koreps Syndrome. Common among botanists apparently. You'd have thought we'd have put some effort into finding a cure, but I guess no one ever thinks they'll be the unlucky one.~|~translationMissing
Kasonde, I...~|~translationMissing
Don't. Whatever you have to say, I don't want to hear it. Do you know how many times I've heard the word 'sorry'? Do you know how many times people have told me they understand?~|~translationMissing
Well they don't. I spent every day working away, telling myself that one day I'd finally be able to live my life, but it was all a lie. That was my life, and it was all so... meaningless!~|~translationMissing
I tried everything. I went to every healer, every mage, every priest.~|~translationMissing
I went to House Arceuus, and they turned me away! What gives them the right?!~|~translationMissing
So no, this doesn't change anything. The Old Ones are my last hope. I either find their secrets, or...~|~translationMissing
Look, we're wasting time here! There's a ritual site to the west. Presumably it's where the Strangler was unleashed. It's my best hope now, and it may well be where you'll find what you're after as well.~|~translationMissing
Take this potion and add those ingredients you gathered to it. It should strengthen your immunity against the Strangler. Now go!~|~translationMissing
Kasonde gives you an unfinished potion.~|~translationMissing
We're running out of time! I'm running out of time! Take this potion and add those ingredients you gathered to it. It should strengthen your immunity against the Strangler. Now go!~|~translationMissing
Did you reach the ritual site? Did you find anything?~|~translationMissing
Just a key.~|~translationMissing
A key? Maybe it opens these doors... Quick, give it to me!~|~translationMissing
You give the key to Kasonde.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. Kasonde exits the locked doors and approaches you.~|~translationMissing
Right, I think I have something, but we need to go quickly.~|~translationMissing
Go? Go where?~|~translationMissing
Back to Kourend of course. You didn't think we'd be able to do this here, did you? I don't have any of the right equipment.~|~translationMissing
But... the infection...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm all too aware! That's why we need to go now!~|~translationMissing
But what if you end up spreading it to Kourend?~|~translationMissing
That's a risk we're going to have to take. We have no other option!~|~translationMissing
You can't be serious! We're talking about thousands of lives here! How do you even know this will work? When the Old Ones tried, it killed them!~|~translationMissing
I haven't come this far to give up now! This is my last hope! If you won't help me, then step aside!~|~translationMissing
It's too high a cost!~|~translationMissing
I don't have time for this! I can already feel it inside me, changing me! Step aside... now!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, Kasonde, but I can't do that.~|~translationMissing
Then you leave me no choice...~|~translationMissing
The cutscene ends, and Kasonde attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
No... Not like this... Not when I'm so close...~|~translationMissing
Please... do something... Help me!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry. I didn't want it to be this way, but I couldn't let you endanger all those people.~|~translationMissing
I just needed more time...~|~translationMissing
I wish I could have helped you find it.~|~translationMissing
At the ritual site... you didn't find what you we're looking for.~|~translationMissing
It wasn't a question. I knew you wouldn't. You didn't find it... because I already had it.~|~translationMissing
I had a feeling it was important, that it might have been what you were after, but if I'd given it to you, you wouldn't have helped me.~|~translationMissing
You didn't know that.~|~translationMissing
I couldn't take the risk. You were my last hope...~|~translationMissing
The medallion. You'll find it in a chest back at my hideout. I hope... I hope it...~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays as you approach the Ancient Vault. A Mysterious Figure approaches you.~|~translationMissing
Er... Hi.~|~translationMissing
Mysterious Figure~|~translationMissing
[player name]. I have an offer for you.~|~translationMissing
What offer?~|~translationMissing
You have something that my mistress wants. Give it to me and you will be rewarded.~|~translationMissing
I think you know what happens if you refuse.~|~translationMissing
Was that a threat?~|~translationMissing
Well then...~|~translationMissing
I need an answer, [player name].~|~translationMissing
How do I know I can trust you?~|~translationMissing
You don't.~|~translationMissing
This doesn't seem like a very good offer.~|~translationMissing
It's the only offer you have. Now make your choice.~|~translationMissing
Well... I like a nice reward as much as the next person, but without any reason to trust you, I'm going to have to decline.~|~translationMissing
I will see you soon.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, kid. Have you had any luck with these statues yet?~|~translationMissing
I have a medallion that I think one of them should be holding.~|~translationMissing
Well what are you waiting for? Go and give it to the statue! That twenty percent split won't earn itself.~|~translationMissing
Once again, I never actually agreed to work with you.~|~translationMissing
Nonsense! Only a fool would say no to such a lucrative partnership, and you're clearly no fool.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... If you say so.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, kid. Nice work on that first statue. That treasure will be ours in no time.~|~translationMissing
Catalytic Guardian~|~translationMissing
You are [player name]?~|~translationMissing
The Great Guardian wants you to know that there has been a development in our fight against the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
What development?~|~translationMissing
A magical signal has been detected emerging from the rift. It is not of the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
Then what is it?~|~translationMissing
Unknown.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I was actually hoping to enter the Scar myself. Perhaps I could investigate this signal while I'm in there.~|~translationMissing
Nothing can survive the Scar. To enter would not be wise.~|~translationMissing
But how do you know nothing can survive? Has anyone actually confirmed that?~|~translationMissing
There are a few who have entered the Scar in the past. None have returned.~|~translationMissing
Well then give me a chance to be the first.~|~translationMissing
If you wish to enter, it is not our place to stop you. In the likely event of your demise, you will be mourned.~|~translationMissing
Thanks... I think. Anything I should know before entering?~|~translationMissing
The rift is unpredictable. Normally, you would not be able to control its destination. However, the magical signal coming from within could be of benefit. It could act as a guide.~|~translationMissing
So you'd be able to send me right to the source?~|~translationMissing
Approximately.~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose that's the best I can ask for.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to enter the Scar?~|~translationMissing
Then may your death come quick, human. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Then speak to me once you are.~|~translationMissing
Human... you survived the Scar?~|~translationMissing
I did.~|~translationMissing
How unexpected. The Great Guardian will need to be informed.~|~translationMissing
In the meantime, do you wish to return to the Scar?~|~translationMissing
Speak to me again if you do.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. As the player boards, Wizard Persten appears.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Persten~|~translationMissing
Persten! You're alive!~|~translationMissing
Well of course I'm alive, silly. I'm Mia Persten! It takes more than the Abyss to kill me.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of which, it's a good job I found you. If you'd have got on that boat, you'd have become fish food!~|~translationMissing
Fish food?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! Come, I'll explain back at my camp.~|~translationMissing
Welcome to my little home away from home. It's not much, but you take what you can get in a place like this.~|~translationMissing
Is it safe here?~|~translationMissing
Of course! You won't find anywhere safer in all the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
Well... that's probably not true, but let's pretend otherwise.~|~translationMissing
Still, the point is, the demons don't come down here thanks to our fishy friend.~|~translationMissing
I already had so many questions, but you keep giving me more. What's this fish thing you keep talking about?~|~translationMissing
One of the many mysteries of this place. It's some sort of sea creature by the looks of it, but it's nothing like anything I've seen before.~|~translationMissing
It's very dangerous, and it's rather annoyingly preventing any navigation of that lovely lake of goo. Quite unfortunate as there's something out there that I really need to get to.~|~translationMissing
Well thankfully you shouldn't need to anymore.~|~translationMissing
I'm guessing you were responsible for that magic signal leaving this place? The Guardians of the Rift were able to use it to stabilise the rift. It's safe for you to leave now.~|~translationMissing
Leave? But I don't want to leave? I'm a leading expert on teleportation. I'd have had no problem getting out of here if I'd wanted to.~|~translationMissing
What? Then why the signal?~|~translationMissing
Because I need to get past the big fishy, but I can't do it alone. I was hoping someone capable would follow the signal and join me. Looks like it worked perfectly!~|~translationMissing
But why do you need to get past this fish... thing?~|~translationMissing
There's a big old ship out there that I believe contains something I need.~|~translationMissing
An old ship? Hmm...~|~translationMissing
Does the name Perseriya mean anything to you?~|~translationMissing
Yes! It's her ship I'm trying to reach!~|~translationMissing
Well she's actually why I'm here as well.~|~translationMissing
And there I was thinking you'd come here just for me. Consider my feelings hurt. Still, seeing as we both want the same thing, how about we work together?~|~translationMissing
Alright, how do we reach this ship?~|~translationMissing
That fish creature needs dealing with. I've already tried myself, but its scales are stronger than anything I've ever encountered before.~|~translationMissing
It must have some sort of weakness.~|~translationMissing
Indeed it does. There's a spot on its back where there's a gap in the scales.~|~translationMissing
So what's the catch?~|~translationMissing
Catch? Ha! Good one.~|~translationMissing
The weak spot isn't easy to reach, especially with how quickly the creature can move around the lake. If we want to get close, we'll need to trap it. There's an island next to Perseriya's ship that should work.~|~translationMissing
I see. So what's your plan for trapping it?~|~translationMissing
I hope you like your fish smoked, because we're going to smoke this one out!~|~translationMissing
It seems Perseriya was in charge of quite the fleet. Her ship isn't the only one in here. There's plenty of others about, still filled to the brim with all sorts of explosive materials.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. You want to set those ships alight. Where can I find them?~|~translationMissing
There's three that I know of, which should be enough for what we need. See those tunnels over there? There's one down each of them.~|~translationMissing
Two are blocked right now, but I'll get that sorted while you work on the first one. Once you set the ship alight, I'll make sure the smoke is directed right towards our fishy friend.~|~translationMissing
How did you survive in here?~|~translationMissing
It wasn't really that hard. Did you not think I would?~|~translationMissing
The Guardians of the Rift didn't think you'd have any chance.~|~translationMissing
Guardians of the Rift? You mentioned them earlier. Who are they?~|~translationMissing
A group of ancient golems built to guard the Temple of the Eye. They've been keeping the rift under control since we opened it.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I'm guessing I won't be their favourite person then.~|~translationMissing
Well it was sort of your fault.~|~translationMissing
It's not like it was intentional. Besides, we should look on the positive side. I've found all sorts of things in here to help with my research.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure they'd consider that to be worth the cost.~|~translationMissing
Well even if we wanted to, we can't turn back time. We may as well just keep looking forward.~|~translationMissing
What is it you want with Perseriya's ship?~|~translationMissing
I reckon I'll find some information there to help with my research.~|~translationMissing
What information?~|~translationMissing
If I knew that, I wouldn't need to go there, would I?~|~translationMissing
But then how do you know there's information on her ship?~|~translationMissing
I found a tablet on another shipwreck down here. It suggested she'd been experimenting with teleportation magic. If that's true, her ship seems the best place to look.~|~translationMissing
What's with the demons in this place?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I'm not totally sure. It's clear the Abyss has demonic connections, hence, you know, Abyssal Demons. But Black Demons? Greater Demons?~|~translationMissing
It's obvious they don't belong here. The delightful denizens of the Abyss haven't taken kindly to their presence.~|~translationMissing
From the rituals they keep performing, my guess is they're looking to harness the magic of the Abyss for themselves.~|~translationMissing
I'll get going.~|~translationMissing
Any luck with those ships yet?~|~translationMissing
There should be one down each of those tunnels over there. Two are blocked right now, but I'll get that sorted while you work on the first one.~|~translationMissing
Not sure if this diving equipment is going to help in here. This... brain juice... is quite thick. I'll give it a go though.~|~translationMissing
You're back! I'm guessing from all the smoke that came this way that all went as planned?~|~translationMissing
It did.~|~translationMissing
Great! I've opened up the second tunnel for you. It's ready when you are.~|~translationMissing
Before I go, I found something I wanted to ask you about.~|~translationMissing
I found an old tablet near the ship. It mentioned two artefacts. One was referred to as Imperium and the other as Primus.~|~translationMissing
Really? They must be code names. I wonder what they refer to...~|~translationMissing
Apparently, the one known as Primus was being defended by Saradominists. Perseriya and her fleet were trying to claim it, but things clearly didn't go as planned, hence them ending up here.~|~translationMissing
I don't follow.~|~translationMissing
Isn't it obvious? It must be the Eye.~|~translationMissing
You're starting to sound a bit accusational.~|~translationMissing
I think it's fair to say that you're normally a very upbeat person, but whenever the Eye is mentioned, you start to act... different. I think you know more than you're letting on.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Alright, you've got me.~|~translationMissing
Do you remember me telling you that my travels had taken me to other planes? One of them was a total wasteland. Ruins of a great civilisation as far as you could see.~|~translationMissing
Naturally, me being me, I was curious. I delved deep into the ruins to try and work out what happened.~|~translationMissing
Turns out, they were in possession of an artefact of immense power. It was capable of limitless creation, but also unimaginable destruction. It delivered them great prosperity, but also led to their ruin.~|~translationMissing
This artefact... The Eye?~|~translationMissing
I think so. It's been known by many names, and most of them have been long forgotten. The Eye of Saradomin was one. The Fist of Guthix was another. But its true name is...~|~translationMissing
The Stone of Jas.~|~translationMissing
That's right... How did you know that?~|~translationMissing
Do you remember that vision I had back in the Temple of the Eye? I saw it. I've somehow known its name ever since, but I just didn't realise until now.~|~translationMissing
How fascinating... Makes sense though. After all, powerful magic leaves powerful traces.~|~translationMissing
So all that stuff about you searching for a teleportation nexus? That was a lie, wasn't it? You were really searching for information on the Stone.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... sorry about that. I had a feeling that if I suddenly popped up claiming to have information on a powerful artefact beyond anything ever encountered before, people might not believe me.~|~translationMissing
I guess that does make sense. So is that what you're hoping to find on Perseriya's ship? Information on the Stone?~|~translationMissing
Well I definitely wouldn't complain, but it's actually this other artefact I'm more interested in. The one referred to as Imperium.~|~translationMissing
I always assumed the Stone to be unique, but what if it's not? Could there be other artefacts of a similar power out there? I have to find out!~|~translationMissing
And on that note, we should really get back to it. Those ships won't burn themselves!~|~translationMissing
What do you know about Imperium so far?~|~translationMissing
Before you came along, I'd already found quite a few mentions of it hidden in various shipwrecks. It seems that Perseriya possessed it for a time, but it was eventually transported somewhere to the east.~|~translationMissing
And you think it's connected to the Stone of Jas?~|~translationMissing
I don't have anything solid, but multiple times it was compared to the Stone. Even if not directly connected, it seems the two were of a similar type of power.~|~translationMissing
Beyond that, I don't really have much. If we want to learn more, we need to reach Perseriya's ship.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back. How did things go?~|~translationMissing
Not too bad. You might be interested in another tablet I found. It mentioned Imperium.~|~translationMissing
How exciting! Well don't leave me hanging in anticipation. What did you find?~|~translationMissing
Apparently a soldier interacted with the artefact at one point. It caused another soldier to enter a frenzy and kill multiple people.~|~translationMissing
Ah, that must have been a bit of a bother for them.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... both soldiers in question were later executed.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear... Still, this is highly useful information. We now know the artefact has the ability to control another, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying!~|~translationMissing
The question now is, did the artefact do it on its own, or was it enacting the will of the soldier that touched it?~|~translationMissing
I guess there's only one way to find out.~|~translationMissing
Indeed! Just one ship to go. I've managed to open up the final tunnel for you.~|~translationMissing
How powerful do you think Imperium is?~|~translationMissing
It's a curious one. We now know Imperium has the power to control another, but that doesn't really tell us much about the overall power of the artefact.~|~translationMissing
Mind control is a dangerous form of magic. The Order of Wizards forbid it for obvious reasons, but with enough skill, it is possible to learn.~|~translationMissing
Mind controlling magic has a large number of drawbacks. All but the most powerful mages can only use it on one person at a time, and the spell is easily broken.~|~translationMissing
But what if Imperium can overcome these limits? What if it can control hundreds, or even thousands, with no way to break that control!~|~translationMissing
That's terrifying!~|~translationMissing
Indeed it is.~|~translationMissing
First the Stone, and now this 'Imperium'. But that begs the question... how many more? So silly of me! I spent so much time focusing on the Stone, I never even considered the possibility...~|~translationMissing
Er... hello?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you're back! Sorry, I was in my own little world there, chittering away. Anyway, looks like our plan worked. I was able to use all that smoke to force our big fish towards that island!~|~translationMissing
So now we just need to properly deal with it.~|~translationMissing
That's right! Now don't worry, I have a very in-depth plan. Basically, one of us needs to be ready to direct the smoke in case it tries to escape while the other goes and gives it a good old poke!~|~translationMissing
I guess I'll be doing the poking?~|~translationMissing
Do you have the magical abilities to maintain a huge whirlwind of smoke that's strong enough to prevent a large aquatic lifeform from passing through?~|~translationMissing
Then yes, you'll be doing the poking!~|~translationMissing
Then I guess we should get to it.~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! Oh, don't forget there's a weak spot on its back that you'll want to try and target. I can't see it letting you get too close, so I reckon you'll want to try and stun it first.~|~translationMissing
From my experiences in this place, some sort of shadowy spell should do the trick! I'm sure a capable individual like you has access to something suitable.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... How do you know about...~|~translationMissing
Because I'm Mia Persten, silly! You don't get as far as me without knowing a thing or two about forbidden magic. Now, just hop on the boat and row out to the island when you're ready. Oh, and try not to die!~|~translationMissing
That big fish won't go sorting itself out. Just hop on the boat and row out to the island when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
As you cross the stepping stones, Persten rows out to join you.~|~translationMissing
Alright, let's see what we've got...~|~translationMissing
Persten rummages around in the debris and pulls out a tablet.~|~translationMissing
Jackpot! Now let's see...~|~translationMissing
Huh? That can't be right...~|~translationMissing
It can't be possible... can it?~|~translationMissing
Persten? What does it say?~|~translationMissing
It's written by one of the crew on Perseriya's ship. Apparently they snuck into her private cabin...~|~translationMissing
And found Imperium inside!~|~translationMissing
What's not right about that? Makes sense she'd have kept it close.~|~translationMissing
This was after Imperium had already been delivered to the east!~|~translationMissing
So it was never delivered? But that can't be right... We've found multiple tablets saying it was.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! That either means she was able to sneak it back onto the ship again, or there was a second artefact!~|~translationMissing
Could that be possible?~|~translationMissing
I don't know... I don't think so... But then again, until recently I didn't even know about this artefact at all.~|~translationMissing
I'm not too sure. I need to gather all my research and see what I can come up with. I guess that means that I've outlived my little home here.~|~translationMissing
So you're going back to the Wizards' Tower?~|~translationMissing
Well... maybe not just yet. I'll have to face the music there at some point, but probably best I wait until after I've got my head around all this Imperium business.~|~translationMissing
If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you'd not mention what we found here to Sedridor and the others until I'm ready.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, but you do need to tell them soon.~|~translationMissing
Oh don't worry, I will. Now, I'd best be getting off. I'm sure I'll see you again before long. I hope you find what you're looking for here.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, Persten. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Persten departs.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, kid. Nice work on those two statues. That treasure will be ours in no time.~|~translationMissing
Captain Malleta~|~translationMissing
What do you want, adventurer?~|~translationMissing
I need to enter the prison.~|~translationMissing
No. General Khazard has ordered us to guard this door. I'm not about to just let you walk through it.~|~translationMissing
But you're guarding the door because of that assassin, right? Why does that mean I can't go in?~|~translationMissing
I don't have time to answer your questions. I've told you that you can't go in, so go away.~|~translationMissing
Are you not bored of being on guard here? It can't be much fun in this dingy cold dungeon. Food must be a bit meh as well.~|~translationMissing
What is your point?~|~translationMissing
If that assassin were to be dealt with, Khazard might reconsider your posting. Rather than sitting here waiting around, why not let me go in and find him?~|~translationMissing
Besides, let's be honest, if I die doing so, Khazard would probably be thrilled.~|~translationMissing
Fine. If it stops you bothering me, feel free to go and get yourself killed.~|~translationMissing
Lovely! Thank you for your time.~|~translationMissing
Mysterious Voice~|~translationMissing
Hey! Can you hear me?~|~translationMissing
Er... Hello?~|~translationMissing
Ah, there you are!~|~translationMissing
Who are you? Are you one of Khazard's soldiers?~|~translationMissing
That's right! Made the mistake of sticking my nose where I shouldn't have. Now I've got myself a lovely little cell and no way to get out of it.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... Seems I've got myself into a similar situation.~|~translationMissing
Well, I tell you what, now that you're here, maybe we have a chance to escape!~|~translationMissing
No idea, but I'm sure we can come up with something. Anything in your cell that you reckon could be of use?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. Let me take a look.~|~translationMissing
Any luck in there?~|~translationMissing
Keep at it. There must be something we can use.~|~translationMissing
You search the bed and find a loose slab of stone underneath it. You try to use the knife to pry it out of the way, but are unable to do so.~|~translationMissing
I managed to find a knife.~|~translationMissing
Oh, pass it through! I reckon I can make use of it.~|~translationMissing
You pass the knife through the hole in the wall.~|~translationMissing
Right, give me a moment...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I have something! See if you can find a use for this.~|~translationMissing
The mysterious individual passes a chisel through the hole in the wall.~|~translationMissing
I lost that chisel you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Oh wait, it's on the floor here. Silly me.~|~translationMissing
You pick up the chisel.~|~translationMissing
You search the bed and find a loose slab of stone underneath it. You use the chisel to pry it out of the way, but the chisel breaks in the process. Beneath the slab, you find a lockpick.~|~translationMissing
How's it going in there?~|~translationMissing
I managed to find a lockpick.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm pretty good with those! Pass it through and I'll see if I can get my cell unlocked. Once I'm out, I can free you as well!~|~translationMissing
You! I should have known!~|~translationMissing
Yes, you probably should have.~|~translationMissing
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now!~|~translationMissing
I can give you two. First, because you'll fail. You have no weapons or armour, and even if you did, it wouldn't go well. Second, because without me you'd still be in that cell.~|~translationMissing
Without me you'd be in a cell as well!~|~translationMissing
Correct. Now, while I appreciate you came here to kill me, we are both in each other's debt, so let's set aside the threats and start focusing on more important matters.~|~translationMissing
Well actually I didn't come here for you. I'm looking for Duke Sucellus.~|~translationMissing
Apparently he used to be in charge of this place. That letter I found mentioned the asylum, which seems a good place to start my search.~|~translationMissing
I suspect your search will be quite a short one as things currently stand.~|~translationMissing
It seems you are yet to consider an obvious question. Are you not wondering how I ended up in that cell?~|~translationMissing
Well... yes, I suppose so.~|~translationMissing
It was that Mahjarrat. Seems he doesn't think much of you either, as he was also responsible for your own imprisonment.~|~translationMissing
Jhallan? But he was your prisoner!~|~translationMissing
He was, but now he's not. There was an unfortunate mishap.~|~translationMissing
A mishap? Nice work.~|~translationMissing
So where is he now?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, but he'll be nearby, and we are currently poorly equipped to deal with him. I'm missing my sword and you don't have any weapons either.~|~translationMissing
Did you see where he put my things?~|~translationMissing
They're in a chest in the cell opposite this one, but the cell is locked. My sword is in there as well.~|~translationMissing
Why do I feel like you have a proposal?~|~translationMissing
Because I do, and you'd be wise to listen to it. I came here in search of something, and the asylum is one of the last places I need to look.~|~translationMissing
With Jhallan around, neither of us stand a good chance of getting what we want. However, if we work together, we can deal with him and get to the asylum.~|~translationMissing
Look, I have no reason to trust you.~|~translationMissing
No, but you don't have any other options. Now, I suggest you focus on finding the key to that cell so we can recover our equipment. While you do that, I'll work out how to reach the asylum.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and you should take this. You might need it.~|~translationMissing
The assassin gives you a lockpick.~|~translationMissing
Hey, slow down there...~|~translationMissing
We'll reconvene once you have the cell open.~|~translationMissing
The assassin disappears.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'The Lusty Annakarl Maid Vol 1 (Unknown Author)'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'A Study of Runes by Cisses Laios'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'The Lost Rituals (Unknown Author)'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'Innocence by Duke Quirinius'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'Cooking for Auspah by Seraphis'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'Longing by Duke Quirinius'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'Senntisten Secrets by Lucius Theron'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'Murder at Lassar by Isolde Gaius'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'The Almighty Mahjarrat by Zemouregal'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'Harmonious by Duke Quirinius'.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of books on the bookcase, but one is noticibly larger than the others. The cover reads 'The Lost Kingdom by Lucius Theron'.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the key?~|~translationMissing
Good. Let's get this cell open.~|~translationMissing
Not yet. First, you have to give me some answers.~|~translationMissing
Rather than resorting to needless anger, had you considered just asking first?~|~translationMissing
Oh... well, why are you here?~|~translationMissing
I told you, I'm looking for something.~|~translationMissing
A magical artefact called the Frostenhorn.~|~translationMissing
Frostenhorn?~|~translationMissing
You've heard of it?~|~translationMissing
I've heard the name, but I don't know anything about it. What is it?~|~translationMissing
I don't know and I don't need to know. I've been paid to recover it from this place and that's all that matters to me.~|~translationMissing
Paid by who?~|~translationMissing
That's confidential.~|~translationMissing
Did this person also pay you to steal that relic from Entrana?~|~translationMissing
They did.~|~translationMissing
And what about all that business with the Hazeel Cult and the Carnilleans?~|~translationMissing
I needed to recover that crest half from the Carnillean Mansion. Framing the Hazeel Cult was the best cover.~|~translationMissing
If the player opposed the cult during the quest Hazeel Cult~|~translationMissing
But why have Hazeel resurrected as part of that?~|~translationMissing
Because it made it believable. Now, are we done?~|~translationMissing
If the player helped the cult during the quest Hazeel Cult~|~translationMissing
But why try to have Hazeel resurrected as part of that?~|~translationMissing
Because it would have made it believable. Unfortunately, I failed to account for you having already done so. Now, are we done?~|~translationMissing
You seem surprised by that.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I wasn't expecting you to be so open about it all.~|~translationMissing
You weren't going to open the gate until I provided satisfactory answers, so I provided them.~|~translationMissing
Why not try to kill me instead? It's not like that's ever been a problem for you before.~|~translationMissing
I kill when it is the best way to further my goal. That would not have been the case here, so I chose the cleaner and more efficient option.~|~translationMissing
Besides, beyond placating your curiosity, the answers I gave are rather meaningless. They do not jeopardise me or my employer in any way.~|~translationMissing
Now, once again, let's get this cell open.~|~translationMissing
Right, you'll be pleased to know that I've obtained a key that can open the way to the asylum. However, Jhallan must be dealt with before we can use it safely.~|~translationMissing
I don't know much about the Mahjarrat, but it's clear they're not easy to kill. Jhallan is thankfully fairly weak for their kind, but that still makes him significantly stronger than us.~|~translationMissing
Our best option will be to trap him. I suggest we do so by repeating what we did before.~|~translationMissing
What we did before?~|~translationMissing
Yes. You distract him and I take him unaware.~|~translationMissing
Are you talking about what happened back in that cave? There was no 'we' about that.~|~translationMissing
You provided an opportunity and I took it. Your awareness of said opportunity was irrelevant.~|~translationMissing
Right... So how do I distract him?~|~translationMissing
The old refugee camp seems like a good place to spring our trap. I left a pack there with some firecrackers in. The noise should quickly attract his attention.~|~translationMissing
Once he's there, don't try to be a hero. Just keep him busy until I'm ready.~|~translationMissing
Is that it?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Now, let's be on our way.~|~translationMissing
The assassin collects his sword and departs.~|~translationMissing
The assassin has left everything you could ever need to make a significant amount of noise.~|~translationMissing
Light the firecrackers?~|~translationMissing
Right, that's him dealt with.~|~translationMissing
Will that ice hold?~|~translationMissing
It should, but it would be unwise to wait and find out. I must resume my search for the Frostenhorn and you have your Duke business to deal with.~|~translationMissing
To the asylum then?~|~translationMissing
Yes. You can get there by heading north. I've already unlocked the gate.~|~translationMissing
That is becoming quite tiresome.~|~translationMissing
Curious...~|~translationMissing
I've checked every corner of this prison now. This room was the last place to look. There is only one possibility~|~translationMissing
The Frostenhorn isn't here.~|~translationMissing
But if it's not here, then where is it?~|~translationMissing
A good question, but one that is not my concern. My employer believed it to be here, but was clearly mistaken. That's their problem.~|~translationMissing
You don't mind that you failed?~|~translationMissing
I did all that was required of me. If they are able to discover the true location of the horn, they are welcome to hire me once more. Until then, my work is done.~|~translationMissing
What makes you think I'm going to let you go? You have a whole lot of murders you need to answer for.~|~translationMissing
I will not be giving you a choice in the matter. Perhaps justice will be served someday, but not today. Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
We're getting close now, kid. Just one more statue to go! I can smell that treasure already!~|~translationMissing
Nonsense! You'd be a fool to turn away now that we're so close! I'm about to make history - and you'll have helped!~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]. I'm sure you have plenty of questions. I will do my best to answer them.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What can I do here?~|~translationMissing
Have you seen any archeologists around here?~|~translationMissing
Human archeologists? Yes, some showed up recently. I told them they'd be fine to look around as long as they were careful. They're probably over by the bank chest.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What happened to the other Imcando Dwarves?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I use the Forge?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Never mind, I have no questions for now.~|~translationMissing
If the player never spoke to Ramarno after completion of Below Ice Mountain~|~translationMissing
Helena~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Did you see that dwarf by the big forge? I think he wanted to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
If the player spoke to Ramarno after completion of Below Ice Mountain~|~translationMissing
Hello. Sorry, I'd love to stop and chat, but I have a new find that I need to work on. If you need anything, I'm sure Prescott can help.~|~translationMissing
Not a problem.~|~translationMissing
Prescott~|~translationMissing
Hello! Look at this place. Isn't it amazing?~|~translationMissing
It sure is! Not every day you find yourself in a lost city.~|~translationMissing
So what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
Does the name Lassar mean anything to you? It was an old fortress that once existed here, long before Camdozaal. I'm wondering if there might still be some traces left down here.~|~translationMissing
A ruin within a ruin? How exciting! We have found the odd thing that doesn't seem to be dwarven in origin, but it's still early days for us here, so we haven't been able to learn much yet.~|~translationMissing
One that was particularly interesting was this strange icon I found in the mine.~|~translationMissing
The archaeologist shows you an unusual icon.~|~translationMissing
Could be a lot more to find over there, but I must admit, I haven't been back since... well...~|~translationMissing
Since what?~|~translationMissing
It's probably nothing, but there's this big sinkhole on the other side of the mine. I'm probably just being silly, but I'm sure I heard a voice coming from inside.~|~translationMissing
Interesting... And if I wanted to go down this hole?~|~translationMissing
Go down the hole?! You're far braver than I am! There's plenty of rocks around there. I'm sure you could tie a rope to one of them. You'd need a pretty long rope though. Here, you can use mine.~|~translationMissing
The archaeologist gives you some rope.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Where did you say that hole was?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost their very long rope~|~translationMissing
You'll find it just on the other side of the mine. You'll need a pretty long rope to get down there though. Here, you can use mine.~|~translationMissing
If the player has their very long rope~|~translationMissing
You'll find it just on the other side of the mine. Be careful down there.~|~translationMissing
Hello! Glad to see you're okay. I was worried you might have gone and got stuck down that hole.~|~translationMissing
No need to worry. I'm mostly quite capable when it comes to these kinds of things!~|~translationMissing
Good to hear!~|~translationMissing
Huh? What happened? Where am I? And who are you?~|~translationMissing
Ketla~|~translationMissing
I am Ketla. I found you wandering the streets. It nearly had you. You were nearly lost.~|~translationMissing
It? What are you on about?~|~translationMissing
An unknowable stranger with a thousand faces. An endless ocean where the lost swim. A fissure in fate that exists beyond time.~|~translationMissing
It twists its way into your very soul, devouring all that you are, until by the time it's done, only one question remains...~|~translationMissing
Do you think you can save them?~|~translationMissing
Oh... I'm sorry. Sometimes it becomes difficult to resist the call. It gets harder with every day that goes by.~|~translationMissing
Resist what? It?~|~translationMissing
Yes. It wants my soul, and I fear it will soon have it. My strength is leaving me and I cannot hold it back. This city will be my doom.~|~translationMissing
But then why not leave? I'm guessing you're an Imcando dwarf, right? A survivor from Camdozaal? Others of your kind still live. You could leave this place and join them.~|~translationMissing
Others still live? I feared I was the last...~|~translationMissing
Well then that is all the more reason to stay. For the good of my people, for all people, it has to be stopped.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could help? I'm a pretty good fighter. I'm sure I can deal with whatever this thing is.~|~translationMissing
Your weapons are worthless. It is not an evil to be slain.~|~translationMissing
Then how can we stop it?~|~translationMissing
The totem. It links our world to the shadows... to it.~|~translationMissing
The shadows? As in the Shadow Realm?~|~translationMissing
You know of the shadows?~|~translationMissing
More than know. I've been there! I have a ring that lets me do so.~|~translationMissing
A ring? I must see it.~|~translationMissing
If the player did not bring their ring of visibility~|~translationMissing
Of course. I don't have it with me, but I can go and fetch it.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Please bring it to me.~|~translationMissing
If the player brought their ring of visibility~|~translationMissing
Of course. I have it right here.~|~translationMissing
You show the ring to Ketla.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the ring?~|~translationMissing
Where did you get this?~|~translationMissing
A wandering merchant gave it to me. I never asked how he got it.~|~translationMissing
There is a great power to this ring, but the shadows here reject it. It must know the ring is a threat.~|~translationMissing
So the ring is useless?~|~translationMissing
On its own, yes. The ring can see into the shadows, but it is not of the shadows. However, I have something that is.~|~translationMissing
Ketla shows you a fragment of strange black stone.~|~translationMissing
A shard of the totem. Too dangerous to use on its own, but with the power of this ring, perhaps I can make it safe.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like it's worth a go.~|~translationMissing
Give me a moment...~|~translationMissing
There. The fragment should be safe to use now.~|~translationMissing
So what can we do with it?~|~translationMissing
You said the ring let you enter the shadows, but that is not the case. It simply allowed you a small glimpse into their darkness.~|~translationMissing
But it rules the shadows. To overcome it, you must enter the shadows as well. The fragment will allow you to do so now.~|~translationMissing
So I can use this fragment to enter the Shadow Realm? But surely there's going to be a lot of danger entering the domain of this... whatever it is.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Once you enter the shadows, you will be at its mercy. Unless you long for the eternal sea, you would be wise not to stay for long.~|~translationMissing
That's... concerning.~|~translationMissing
It is the only way. You must enter the shadows and destroy the totem.~|~translationMissing
But where is the totem?~|~translationMissing
Its power is strongest in the sunken cathedral. That is likely where the totem will be found.~|~translationMissing
And I'm guessing I won't just be able to walk on in there?~|~translationMissing
No. It has blocked the way. You will need to clear the path with cleansing flames.~|~translationMissing
Cleansing flames? Like a tinderbox?~|~translationMissing
The fire of our world will do nothing in the shadows, but the old inhabitants of this city, they tried to fight off the inevitable darkness. They created things that could help you.~|~translationMissing
If you find their old schematics, bring them to me. I can use them to create new tools for you.~|~translationMissing
Alright. Anything else I should know?~|~translationMissing
The fragment won't just work anywhere. To enter the shadows, you must use it where they are strongest. Seek out the places where that is the case. You will know them when you see them.~|~translationMissing
And what about leaving again?~|~translationMissing
That is thankfully easier. The fragment will let you leave the shadows whenever you desire. Be sure to use it before darkness claims you.~|~translationMissing
Ketla gives you the blackstone fragment.~|~translationMissing
How did you end up down here?~|~translationMissing
You know of Camdozaal. That means you have seen what became of our home.~|~translationMissing
I have.~|~translationMissing
When the barbarians came, many tried to fight. I should have fought with them, but I turned away. I had a duty to my people, but I abandoned them.~|~translationMissing
The barbarians had blocked all exits, so the only way to flee was down. I hid down here while my people died, but now I pay the price for my choice.~|~translationMissing
There are worse things than death, and this city is home to them all.~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't feel guilty for fleeing. Your people had no hope against the barbarians.~|~translationMissing
You misunderstand. Fleeing was not the cause of my guilt. My punishment is for what happened next...~|~translationMissing
It is best you do not know. Please, let us speak of something else.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about this city?~|~translationMissing
Lassar. That is what they called this place. It was once home to some of the greatest minds in the world.~|~translationMissing
I knew about the fortress of Lassar, but I had no idea a city was here as well.~|~translationMissing
It seems they kept it hidden on purpose. This city was a place of discovery, where magic and science were practiced in equal measure. They did not want their secrets falling into the wrong hands.~|~translationMissing
I guess that's how this place is so well preserved. No one even knew it was here.~|~translationMissing
Yes. They remained hidden down here long after their fortress fell. They were still here even after the construction of Camdozaal.~|~translationMissing
Their isolation kept them safe for a time, but when darkness fell, there was no one to hear their screams.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me any more about this entity?~|~translationMissing
It is beyond our understanding. It exists in the shadows, and there it should remain, but the blackstone is like a blade. It cuts through into our world.~|~translationMissing
Blackstone?~|~translationMissing
It comes from the shadows as well. It holds a great power, and many have tried to use it, not knowing the cost of doing so.~|~translationMissing
Is that what happened here?~|~translationMissing
Yes. They were studying the totem, but in doing so, they followed in our footsteps, dooming their city.~|~translationMissing
Followed in your footsteps? But it wasn't blackstone that destroyed Camdozaal, was it?~|~translationMissing
Camdozaal was not the first home of my people. From a young age, we are all taught of the Fall of Imcandoria, of the disaster that claimed our city.~|~translationMissing
But down here, I have seen the truth. It was no volcano that destroyed our home, it was the totem.~|~translationMissing
The same totem that's now here?~|~translationMissing
Did it follow us, or did we follow it? Are we fated to be its victims forevermore? Or will the cycle end here? It will soon be time to find out.~|~translationMissing
Strange Voice~|~translationMissing
[player name]...~|~translationMissing
Three out of sixteen possible statements are chosen from below~|~translationMissing
There is an avalanche of horrors which has discovered your name.~|~translationMissing
There is a bard who sings of your final moments.~|~translationMissing
There is a blood-soaked record of your darkest moments.~|~translationMissing
There is a choir of souls who you will one day meet.~|~translationMissing
There is a city of blackstone where the screams are ever silent.~|~translationMissing
There is an empire of darkness where hope flickers and dies.~|~translationMissing
There is a judge who has already passed your sentence.~|~translationMissing
There is a library of sorrow where your final fate is written.~|~translationMissing
There is a monument built in honour of the suffering you desire.~|~translationMissing
There is an ocean of souls where you are one day fated to swim.~|~translationMissing
There is an open wound that bleeds only darkness.~|~translationMissing
There is a priest who prays for the oceans of the dead.~|~translationMissing
There is a reaper who has a thousand gibbering faces.~|~translationMissing
There is a song so loud that you only hear silence.~|~translationMissing
There is a stranger who wears a black mask under their skin.~|~translationMissing
There is a void that echoes with the cries of those you failed to save.~|~translationMissing
One of the two possible statements are chosen from below~|~translationMissing
Your fate is sealed, [player name], and only one question remains...~|~translationMissing
Your only have one future, [player name], so ask yourself this...~|~translationMissing
Do you really think you can save them?~|~translationMissing
I have a schematic here.~|~translationMissing
Let me see.~|~translationMissing
You show the schematic to Ketla.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think I can work with this. Give me a moment...~|~translationMissing
There. You can collect your new item from the workbench. Let me know if you want any information on how it works.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about one of these items?~|~translationMissing
Which one?~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about the Shadow Torch?~|~translationMissing
It is a light that will aid you in the shadows, where all other lights fail. It is the only thing that can destroy what lurks there. Use it well.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about the Shadow Blocker?~|~translationMissing
Almost nothing can stop you from being consumed by the shadows, but set the Shadow Blocker down, and it will provide a small area of safety. It's the only safety you'll get.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about the Revitalising Idol?~|~translationMissing
Unless you wish for the void, you must not spend too long in the shadows. Once set down, you can use the Revitalising Idol to give you more time there. But remember, time still always runs out in the end.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about the Anima Portal?~|~translationMissing
Those that lurk in the shadows do not take kindly to we that still live. They will hunt you. Use the Anima Portal to give them something else to hunt. It provides a glimmer of life in their sea of emptiness.~|~translationMissing
Actually, let's talk about something else.~|~translationMissing
Mysterious Voice 1~|~translationMissing
Are you ready, my child?~|~translationMissing
Mysterious Voice 2~|~translationMissing
I... I think so.~|~translationMissing
Mysterious Voice 3~|~translationMissing
He has doubts.~|~translationMissing
No! It's just...~|~translationMissing
Do not be afraid, my child, for you are not alone. Your voice will be one of thousands, singing an eternal silence.~|~translationMissing
What do I need to do?~|~translationMissing
Seek out our divine order in the cistern below. They will guide you across the waves.~|~translationMissing
Go now, and keep our icon close, for it marks you as one of the chosen. Without it, you are forsaken.~|~translationMissing
Okay... I'll go right away!~|~translationMissing
And so another voice joins the Silent Choir.~|~translationMissing
He is afraid. He is not ready.~|~translationMissing
It matters not. The day of ascension approaches. His fear will be washed away by the endless sea...~|~translationMissing
This torch schematic. It's a fake.~|~translationMissing
Fake? But how?~|~translationMissing
It is marked by the black hand. This is the doing of the Silent Choir.~|~translationMissing
Silent Choir?~|~translationMissing
They were the first to fall. It corrupted them and made them its own. They undid the work of those that tried to resist. Harbingers for what was to come.~|~translationMissing
So they stole the real schematic? Where would they have taken it?~|~translationMissing
You ask many questions. I have one for you.~|~translationMissing
Really? Is now the best time?~|~translationMissing
You did not come to help, but you do so anyway. Why are you here?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for information on someone known as the Whisperer. I have reason to beleve[sic] she was here before the city fell.~|~translationMissing
There are many whispers in this city, and it hears them all. Will you join them? Will you join the Silent Choir?~|~translationMissing
Ketla? Are you okay?~|~translationMissing
It sees you, [player name]. Did you really think you could hide? Did you really think you could save them?~|~translationMissing
Ketla!~|~translationMissing
Huh? What is it?~|~translationMissing
Are you okay? You were in some sort of trance.~|~translationMissing
It knows. It knows what we are trying to do. We must hurry. Soon it will be impossible to resist.~|~translationMissing
The Silent Choir. They had a church. They built it somewhere in the city. Somewhere hidden.~|~translationMissing
If the player viewed the remnant in the pub before talking to her~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I think it might be in the cistern beneath us.~|~translationMissing
How do you know this?~|~translationMissing
Something I found earlier. However, it also seemed to suggest that some sort of icon is needed to enter the church.~|~translationMissing
Then you must find one of these icons. Be quick. Time is not on our side.~|~translationMissing
If the player did not the remnant in the pub before talking to her~|~translationMissing
Then we have to find it. Can you think of anywhere that would be a good place to start?~|~translationMissing
The inn. They met there. Hiding in plain sight. Perhaps they left something behind.~|~translationMissing
It's worth a shot. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Be quick. Time is not on our side.~|~translationMissing
You have the icon? Good. You should be able to reach the cistern using the drain in the square outside. Hurry.~|~translationMissing
Copies of the player begin to surround them, as each appearance darkens the screen slowly, chanting one of the following.~|~translationMissing
[player name]~|~translationMissing
There is an atrocity written upon blackstone.~|~translationMissing
There is a king who presides over a court of corpses.~|~translationMissing
The screen fully fades to black, and the player appears in the middle of a body of water.~|~translationMissing
What is this? What's happening?~|~translationMissing
There is a truth written upon the blackstone, and you cannot escape it.~|~translationMissing
Come, [player name]. The Silent Choir awaits you. It is time for your eternal song.~|~translationMissing
This isn't real! I know this isn't real!~|~translationMissing
You cannot escape your fate, [player name]. The endless sea calls for you.~|~translationMissing
Do you really think you can hide, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
The player snaps back to reality.~|~translationMissing
The totem! I... What happened?~|~translationMissing
You were gone too long. I came to find you, but it already had you. You had fallen.~|~translationMissing
Then how did you save me?~|~translationMissing
The totem. I destroyed it.~|~translationMissing
You did? So it's over?~|~translationMissing
No... I thought destroying the totem would be enough, but it's already too late. It has claimed this place now. We can never undo that.~|~translationMissing
But surely destroying the totem did something?~|~translationMissing
Its influence has been weakened. Without the totem, it cannot spread beyond this city.~|~translationMissing
Then you still achieved what you set out to do, right? The surviving Imcando are safe now. You can leave.~|~translationMissing
I thought destroying the totem would be the end. I thought it would bring peace...~|~translationMissing
But there is no peace. I still hear their screams. I will never be free of what I did to them.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand.~|~translationMissing
Good. Pray that you never have to.~|~translationMissing
But...~|~translationMissing
No more of this. I found the missing schematic in the church. Your new tool is ready. Perhaps you can use it to find what it is you seek here.~|~translationMissing
The cathedral is the only place I haven't searched.~|~translationMissing
There is a darkness there. I thought it was the totem, but clearly not. Something else lurks in those depths...~|~translationMissing
Then I'd best be careful.~|~translationMissing
I will not be here when you return. My journey in this place is done. It is time to start a new one. I will leave my things on the workbench for you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Ketla, for everything. Whatever it is you're looking for... I hope you eventually find it.~|~translationMissing
Farewell, [player name]. Perhaps we will meet again.~|~translationMissing
A small explosion occurs, knocking the player out.~|~translationMissing
Pathetic.~|~translationMissing
The player comes to in a prison cell within a temple.~|~translationMissing
You escaped.~|~translationMissing
It seems I have a knack for that sort of thing. Maybe you underestimated me.~|~translationMissing
Unlikely. You have displayed moderate skill at best.~|~translationMissing
I assume you have the medallion?~|~translationMissing
And I'm guessing you're not about to just give it to me?~|~translationMissing
Correct. You are left with two options.~|~translationMissing
If you wish, I will allow you to accept your defeat and walk away.~|~translationMissing
Or?~|~translationMissing
I have gone too long without a worthy challenger. You say I underestimated you? Prove it. Show me a true fight.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm not backing down now.~|~translationMissing
Very well...~|~translationMissing
Blimey, kid. You don't half take your time, do you? That treasure of ours won't uncover itself!~|~translationMissing
Ours? Like I said before, I never actually agreed to work with you.~|~translationMissing
What? You're not thinking of double-crossing me, are you?~|~translationMissing
I can't double-cross you if I was never working with you to begin with! Besides, we have more important things to worry about than treasure.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I see what's happening! You're trying to trick me so you can take the treasure for yourself!~|~translationMissing
Listen to me! We're not the only ones trying to get into this place! There was this woman who kept trying to steal the medallions. Someone sent her!~|~translationMissing
Well of course there will be others who want the treasure! All the more reason for you to stop messing around.~|~translationMissing
I'm not going any further until we work out what's going on.~|~translationMissing
I really thought you had what it takes, kid, but you're just another fool. If you won't help me find the treasure, I'll just have to do it myself!~|~translationMissing
Asgarnia Smith throws a smoke bomb toward the player, dazing them. As you come to, you see that he had placed the medallion and opened the way down. Upon climbing down the stairs, the player will walk towards Asgarnia Smith.~|~translationMissing
What in the world are you playing at?~|~translationMissing
Look at it... It's... beautiful!~|~translationMissing
The camera pans towards the treasure~|~translationMissing
a large horn on a plinth.~|~translationMissing
Do you feel that? There's a power radiating off it unlike anything I've felt before...~|~translationMissing
This power... I've felt it before...~|~translationMissing
So you know what it is?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly. The last time I felt this power, it was something very different creating it.~|~translationMissing
That said, I reckon I do have some idea as to what this is.~|~translationMissing
The Frostenhorn. I've no idea what it does, but it's a powerful Zarosian artefact that it seems quite a few people are searching for.~|~translationMissing
The Frostenhorn has the ability to amplify power to potentially unimaginable levels.~|~translationMissing
Its rediscovery would be revolutionary, but there's just one problem...~|~translationMissing
The camera pans towards Mysterious Voice, revealing Dr Banikan.~|~translationMissing
That's not the Frostenhorn.~|~translationMissing
Dr Banikan? You followed me here?~|~translationMissing
I did. You must forgive me, friend, for I'm afraid I've deceived you in another way as well.~|~translationMissing
Dr Banikan transforms into Azzanadra.~|~translationMissing
Azzanadra?!~|~translationMissing
My apologies, but my subterfuge was necessary. There are far too many who would have tried to stop me recovering the Frostenhorn.~|~translationMissing
After our earlier encounter, I came to believe it might be here, but it seems I was mistaken.~|~translationMissing
But if this isn't the Frostenhorn, then what is it?~|~translationMissing
There are many powerful artefacts in this world, but few are truly unknowable. This is one of those few. A relic that predates even the gods themselves.~|~translationMissing
It has had many names over many millennia, but to us, it was simply known as the Elder Horn.~|~translationMissing
What does it do?~|~translationMissing
It grants absolute control. With this, one person has the power to bring entire armies to their knees, all without a single drop of blood being shed.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... I think I've heard of this artefact. You say it's been known by many names? Was one of them Imperium?~|~translationMissing
You are well informed. Perhaps then you also know that the Horn was supposedly sent far to the east, which begs the question as to how it stands before us.~|~translationMissing
Because there were two.~|~translationMissing
Something I discovered while tracking down Perseriya. It didn't make sense then, but it does now.~|~translationMissing
The one she took east was a fake. She secretly kept the real one. The intention must always have been to hide it here.~|~translationMissing
A clever deception, although it does raise another question. If the Frostenhorn was never here, then where is it?~|~translationMissing
Hazeel appears before the group.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel~|~translationMissing
Azzanadra. It's been a while.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel. I thought I sensed someone lurking in the shadows. How long have you been here?~|~translationMissing
Long enough. And in answer to your question, the Frostenhorn was destroyed.~|~translationMissing
Destroyed? How?~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you might be able to enlighten us, considering you were there when it happened.~|~translationMissing
I was?~|~translationMissing
Yes. It was during your little excursion to Ghorrock Prison.~|~translationMissing
Enakhra appears before the group.~|~translationMissing
Enakhra~|~translationMissing
Enough talk, Hazeel. We have business to attend to. The Elder Horn will be claimed in Zamorak's name.~|~translationMissing
Enakhra. You knew the Elder Horn was here?~|~translationMissing
Of course not! Do you really think we'd have left it here for so long if that were the case? We are not fools.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of fools, I know he's here as well! Reveal yourself!~|~translationMissing
Akthanakos appears before the group.~|~translationMissing
Akthanakos~|~translationMissing
Gladly.~|~translationMissing
Were all of you just waiting for me to open this place?~|~translationMissing
We had no choice. This vault was sealed with magics that prevented beings like ourselves from opening it.~|~translationMissing
It didn't have to be that way, Hazeel. We had proxies available. Had you supported my plan, we'd have the Horn by now.~|~translationMissing
Unlikely. Your minion failed to recover even one of the medallions.~|~translationMissing
What a surprise. Enakhra coming up with a flawed plan as usual.~|~translationMissing
Would you like me to turn you into a boneguard again, you camel-loving coward?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to see you try. Come, Azzanadra. We can make short work of these traitors and claim the Horn for Zaros.~|~translationMissing
You Zarosians have no hope of withstanding the power of two Zamorakian Mahjarrat. The Horn is ours.~|~translationMissing
Two? We are not the fools you take us for, Enakhra. I can sense five Mahjarrat here, but I only see four.~|~translationMissing
Who are you hiding? Khazard? He always loved lurking in the shadows.~|~translationMissing
Khazard is attending to business in the North. Surely it is you who is hiding someone.~|~translationMissing
We do not hide like you do. We came alone.~|~translationMissing
But if you all came alone...~|~translationMissing
The camera pans towards Asgarnia Smith.~|~translationMissing
Oh... hello.~|~translationMissing
Enakhra casts a revealing spell towards Asgarnia Smith, forcing him to slowly revert into his true form~|~translationMissing
a Mahjarrat named Sliske.~|~translationMissing
Sliske. I should have known.~|~translationMissing
Sliske~|~translationMissing
Azzanadra.~|~translationMissing
The Serpent himself. Why are you here?~|~translationMissing
Why am I here?~|~translationMissing
Well I'm here for the Horn.~|~translationMissing
You think you can just take it?~|~translationMissing
Of course. My friend here and I worked hard for it.~|~translationMissing
I'm not your friend! I don't even know you!~|~translationMissing
No? I think you do. I think you know me better than anyone.~|~translationMissing
You and I have been friends for some time now. Don't you remember?~|~translationMissing
Sliske transforms into Wizard Persten.~|~translationMissing
Don't you remember how we survived the horrors of the Scar?~|~translationMissing
Sliske transforms into the assassin.~|~translationMissing
Don't you remember how we escaped Ghorrock Prison?~|~translationMissing
Sliske transforms into Ketla.~|~translationMissing
Don't you remember how we held back the shadows of Lassar?~|~translationMissing
Sliske transforms into Kasonde.~|~translationMissing
Don't you remember how we overcame the infected Stranglewood?~|~translationMissing
You?~|~translationMissing
Me.~|~translationMissing
So... they were never real? It was all a lie? It was always just you?~|~translationMissing
A lie? No. They were all so real, until their lives were cut short. Their stories would have ended, but I stepped in.~|~translationMissing
I became them and they became me. In many ways, they're the real me, far more so than the form before you now.~|~translationMissing
You used them to manipulate me! Why?~|~translationMissing
He needed you to open the vault.~|~translationMissing
But he didn't need me to get those medallions! He already had one of them!~|~translationMissing
Were you just toying with me?~|~translationMissing
Toying? No. It was a test.~|~translationMissing
What test?~|~translationMissing
To see if you were worthy.~|~translationMissing
Of what?~|~translationMissing
Of me.~|~translationMissing
You should have contacted me, Sliske. You should have told me about the Horn.~|~translationMissing
He clearly wanted it for himself.~|~translationMissing
No, not myself. I want the Horn for all of us.~|~translationMissing
What nonsense are you on about?~|~translationMissing
Do you not see our fate? Over and over, we have our ritual. Over and over, we doom one of our kind to the endless void.~|~translationMissing
It's all so... predictable. It's all so... tiresome. And in the end, it will be the death of us all.~|~translationMissing
But the Horn will be our salva tion. I will use it to break the cycle that has shackled us for so long. We will finally be free.~|~translationMissing
The ritual approaches once more, but things will be different this time. This will be the final Ritual of the Mahjarrat.~|~translationMissing
He's finally lost it. We can take him. He's alone.~|~translationMissing
Sliske summons the Barrows Brothers.~|~translationMissing
I'm never alone.~|~translationMissing
You will not be taking that Horn, Enakhra. Not while I stand.~|~translationMissing
Then I'll just have to kill you first!~|~translationMissing
Enakhra begins to attack Akthanakos. Meanwhile, Guthan, Dharok, and Ahrim begins to attack Hazeel, with Torag, Karil, and Verac attack Azzanadra. Sliske walks toward the Elder Horn.~|~translationMissing
Stop! You're not going anywhere with that horn!~|~translationMissing
Don't you see, [player name]? I can't stop now. Do you not see our future? Only with the Horn can we make it happen.~|~translationMissing
Whatever future you're planning, it ends here!~|~translationMissing
End? No. This is just the beginning. In time, you will see the truth.~|~translationMissing
I doubt that!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps some more familiar faces will change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Sliske summons the Forsaken Assassin, Ketla the Unworthy, Kasonde the Craven, and Persten the Deceitful. He will then cast a long spell on the Elder Horn.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays, where Sliske completes his spell and teleports the Elder Horn away.~|~translationMissing
You fought well, [player name]. You will be a worthy vessel.~|~translationMissing
I'll see you in the North.~|~translationMissing
Sliske teleports away. The camera pans towards the rest of the group, and the Barrows Brothers disappear as well.~|~translationMissing
We have failed.~|~translationMissing
Hmph!~|~translationMissing
I'll see you at the ritual, Akthanakos. Perhaps this one will be your last.~|~translationMissing
Enakhra teleports away.~|~translationMissing
Our allies must be informed of this. Come, Azzanadra.~|~translationMissing
Akthanakos teleports away, and the cutscene ends.~|~translationMissing
It seems your pet has broken free of his leash, Azzanadra.~|~translationMissing
You know as much as I that Sliske serves no one but himself. His actions are his own.~|~translationMissing
Yet you have shielded him for centuries. A choice that all of us may now suffer from.~|~translationMissing
You can blame me as much as you wish, Hazeel. It is irrelevant. Sliske now holds the Elder Horn and we must be ready to oppose him.~|~translationMissing
We? You made your choice a long time ago, Azzanadra. There is no 'we' anymore.~|~translationMissing
And yet you yourself admit that Sliske poses a threat to us all. The prospect of working with Zamorakians gives me no pleasure, but it may be the only option.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Time will soon tell.~|~translationMissing
Now, we're done here. I'll see you soon, Azzanadra.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel teleports away.~|~translationMissing
Well, adventurer, it seems I owe you an apology.~|~translationMissing
I did not show you the trust that you deserved. You freed me from my prison, a feat even my closest followers failed to achieve, and yet I doubted you.~|~translationMissing
I did not know your allegiance, and so I was cautious, but it is clear that focusing on allegiances has blinded us. Sliske took advantage of that.~|~translationMissing
Oh, well thank you, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Now, I must ask about the destruction of the Frostenhorn. Sliske's doing?~|~translationMissing
It must have been.~|~translationMissing
Then I fear the other artefacts will have met a similar fate.~|~translationMissing
Other artefacts?~|~translationMissing
The Frostenhorn was one of three powerful items I was seeking. Together, they may have been my best chance to determine the fate of my lord.~|~translationMissing
And Sliske didn't want that?~|~translationMissing
Apparently not, though who could say why. I would never describe Sliske as a true believer, but until now, he always supported the Empty Lord.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, he himself was entrusted with another of the three artefacts. An icon that was kept under close guard by those wights of his.~|~translationMissing
Ah... Well unless they were guarding multiple icons, I'm afraid Sliske destroyed that one as well. As for your third artefact, it didn't happen to be on Entrana, did it?~|~translationMissing
I had yet to track it down, but that does seem likely. It was stolen by Saradominists long ago.~|~translationMissing
Then I think it's safe to say it's been destroyed too. Sliske stole it from Entrana while disguised as that assassin.~|~translationMissing
So my worst fears are confirmed. This may well be the darkest day for us since the fall of the Empty Lord.~|~translationMissing
What will you do now?~|~translationMissing
Since you freed me, I have been driven by a singular purpose. I exist for Zaros. I exist for the Empire. Sliske thinks he has destroyed that purpose, but I will not give up.~|~translationMissing
However, that is for another day. There are more immediate matters to concern myself with now. The Ritual of the Mahjarrat is fast approaching, and whatever Sliske is planning will happen there.~|~translationMissing
I must ensure I am prepared, and while it may not have been your intention, you are part of this now. You must also ensure you are ready. To help with this, I have something to offer you.~|~translationMissing
I understand you are in possession of a ring that lets you see into the Shadow Realm? Considering Sliske's mastery over that place, that is a power that will likely be of great use to you.~|~translationMissing
Allow me to upgrade it with some offensive and defensive enchantments. They may well give you an important edge if you find yourself fighting in the shadows.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Do you need me to fetch the ring for you?~|~translationMissing
No need. I can summon it with ease.~|~translationMissing
And on that note, I must leave you, my friend. May you walk in the shadow of the Empty Lord.~|~translationMissing
Archmage Sedridor~|~translationMissing
Hello again, [player name]. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you teleport me to the Rune Essence Mine?~|~translationMissing
I have news on Persten.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but she's gone.~|~translationMissing
I see. It was always unlikely that she'd survive the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
It wasn't the Abyss. I think she might have been dead long before then. The Persten we spoke to was an imposter.~|~translationMissing
An imposter? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
A Mahjarrat called Sliske was disguised as her.~|~translationMissing
I can't believe it. Persten and I had our differences, but this...~|~translationMissing
I'd better share this news with the others. Thank you for bringing it to me.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How are things at the Temple of the Eye?~|~translationMissing
If the player has informed Archmage Sedridor about Persten~|~translationMissing
Apprentice Felix~|~translationMissing
Hey, [player name]. I heard about Persten. I can't believe it...~|~translationMissing
I know, Felix. I'm sorry.~|~translationMissing
I wish I could have met her... The real her I mean. I bet she'd have known how to properly close this rift.~|~translationMissing
I guess it's just down to us though. Speaking of which, back to work I guess. Did you have any abyssal pearls you wanted to trade?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Let's see what you have.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What's that rift guardian doing over there?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Why are you selling things here?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Could you tell me more about this place.~|~translationMissing
Hello, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. How are things here?~|~translationMissing
Things aren't easy for the family, especially since they never got closure. They're getting through it, though.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm not sure if it will help them much, but I do have some news on that assassin.~|~translationMissing
He was actually a Mahjarrat in disguise. I got close to dealing with him, but he escaped.~|~translationMissing
A Mahjarrat? I don't even know what one of those is... You say he escaped?~|~translationMissing
For now, but I don't intend to let him keep eluding me forever.~|~translationMissing
Well I wish you luck in your search, adventurer. Thank you for the update.~|~translationMissing
I have something to tell you. It's about another dwarf.~|~translationMissing
Another dwarf? An Imcando Dwarf?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I encountered someone I believed to be a dwarf, but it was a lie. It was a Mahjarrat in disguise as someone called Ketla.~|~translationMissing
Ketla...~|~translationMissing
You knew her?~|~translationMissing
I did, long ago. Is she...~|~translationMissing
She's gone, Ramarno. I'm so sorry.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, [player name], but let us not speak of this further. To learn of the death of another of my kin is no surprise, but it pains me all the same. I would prefer to focus my thoughts elsewhere.~|~translationMissing
Sir Tiffy Cashien~|~translationMissing
Good day Proselyte. Is there anything I can do for you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have any jobs for me yet?~|~translationMissing
I have news on that assassin who attacked Entrana.~|~translationMissing
Ah! Do tell, old bean.~|~translationMissing
Did you know he was a Mahjarrat?~|~translationMissing
A Mahjarrat! You must be pulling on my leg, what?~|~translationMissing
His name is Sliske. Have you heard of him?~|~translationMissing
Sliske, hmm? We have dossiers on many Mahjarrat, but I must confess, this is a new name to me. Poor show! I'll have to see what we have hiding in the archives.~|~translationMissing
While your there, it might be worth looking up something called the Elder Horn. It's an artefact that Sliske has now claimed. One that has the ability to control minds.~|~translationMissing
A mind controlling artefact you say? Sounds like I'll need to report this to the top brass. Can't see them being too thrilled about it. Thank you for the update, old bean.~|~translationMissing

Monk~|~translationMissing
Good day to you adventurer, could you spare the time to help me?~|~translationMissing
Start the Devious Minds quest?~|~translationMissing
Sure thing, what do you need?~|~translationMissing
Our warriors are facing new and dangerous threats, we need a specially designed weapon to be victorious. If you could help by building one of these weapons you will help to ensure victory is ours.~|~translationMissing
Ooohhh a new weapon!~|~translationMissing
Yes yes, now pay attention. I need you to take a two handed sword, mithril should do, to Doric's place and grind it down to a slender blade. Once it's flexible enough you should be able to string it with a normal~|~translationMissing
bow string. Bring it back here when you're done.~|~translationMissing
Have you brought the weapon for me?~|~translationMissing
Yep, got it right here for you.~|~translationMissing
Ah excellent, this won't be forgotten. You've been a great help, though I wonder if you could do me one final favour.~|~translationMissing
Wait... this sounds familiar...~|~translationMissing
What are you talking about? I just need you to make a delivery to Entrana for me. There's a special ceremony, which unfortunately I can't attend, and I wanted to give them a gift to mark the occasion.~|~translationMissing
Ok, let's do this then, pass me the present.~|~translationMissing
Not so fast, it's supposed to be a surprise so you'll need to sneak it onto the island. I hear there's some kind of 'other realm' or some such which you've got access to...~|~translationMissing
You mean the Abyss?~|~translationMissing
Yes that's the one. Now take this orb and put it in one of the large pouches from there, don't want it getting damaged. A Colossal pouch may also do the trick.~|~translationMissing
Can you teach me how to use it?~|~translationMissing
It's a foreign design, maybe later one of our warriors will show you how it's used. Speaking of which, may I have it please?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, sorry.~|~translationMissing
You need to hurry or you'll miss the ceremony.~|~translationMissing
Er... I lost the orb...~|~translationMissing
You what? Ah well, good thing I have a spare, be more careful this time.~|~translationMissing
Monk of Entrana~|~translationMissing
What's this pouch?~|~translationMissing
Err...nothing... I'll be going now.~|~translationMissing
Someone just stole our relic, this is a disaster! Adventurer, you must find the fool who put that teleport beacon on the altar.~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah, about that...~|~translationMissing
What are you trying to say?~|~translationMissing
I put it there...~|~translationMissing
Well at least you're honest about it, but where did you get it from?~|~translationMissing
It was supposed to be a gift from a monk near the river Salve.~|~translationMissing
Those orbs are volatile, they use some very old magic, no worshipper of Saradomin would dare touch one. You must return to this monk and find out more, but be wary.~|~translationMissing
The poor guy appears to have been killed by powerful magic!~|~translationMissing
Many greetings. Welcome to our fair island.~|~translationMissing
Have you found our relic yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, I went back to where that monk was but all I found was a dead body.~|~translationMissing
Yeah it looked like he'd been killed by magic, I'm not sure it was the same person either...~|~translationMissing
This is not good, that relic was part of an ancient artefact which was said to have awesome power. You must report to Sir Tiffy in Falador, he must be informed.~|~translationMissing
Devious Minds.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, unfortunately I've got some bad news...~|~translationMissing
This wouldn't be that old relic being stolen from Entrana would it?~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah, how'd you know?~|~translationMissing
Part of the business, what do you know about what went on?~|~translationMissing
Well there was this monk who needed help...~|~translationMissing
... so I was told to come see you.~|~translationMissing
Good that confirms our own intel and with the designs for that weapon we can work on some tactics.~|~translationMissing
You mean I can learn to use it?~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha, no. At least not yet anyway, we need to know more about what we're dealing with. We still don't know who the monk was and where he got that orb from.~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but we'll be in touch. Oh and don't worry about that relic, we'll get it back somehow!~|~translationMissing

My anvils get enough work with my own use. I make pickaxes, and it takes a lot of hard work. If you could get me some more materials, then I could let you use them.~|~translationMissing
Start Doric's Quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I will get you the materials.~|~translationMissing
Clay is what I use more than anything, to make casts. Could you get me 6 clay, 4 copper ore, and 2 iron ore, please? I could pay a little, and let you use my anvils. Take this pickaxe with you just in case you need it.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not already have all of the materials~|~translationMissing
Where can I find those?~|~translationMissing
You'll be able to find all those ores in the rocks just inside the Dwarven Mine. Head east from here and you'll find the entrance in the side of Ice Mountain.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 15 Mining~|~translationMissing
But I'm not a good enough miner to get iron ore.~|~translationMissing
Oh well, you could practice mining until you can. Can't beat a bit of mining - it's a useful skill. Failing that, you might be able to find a more experienced adventurer to buy the iron ore off.~|~translationMissing
Certainly, I'll be right back!~|~translationMissing
If the player already has all of the materials~|~translationMissing
You know, it's funny you should require those exact things!~|~translationMissing
I can usually fit 28 things in my backpack and in a world full of quite literally limitless possibilities, a complete coincidence has occurred!~|~translationMissing
I don't quite understand what you're saying?~|~translationMissing
Well, out of pure coincidence, despite definitely not knowing what you were about to request, I just so happened to have carried those exact items!~|~translationMissing
If the player has the exact amounts~|~translationMissing
In fact, in the exact quantities too!~|~translationMissing
Oh my, that is a coincidence! Pass them here, please. I can spare you some coins for your trouble, and please use my anvils any time you want.~|~translationMissing
You hand the clay, copper, and iron to Doric.~|~translationMissing
No, hitting rocks is for the boring people, sorry.~|~translationMissing
That is your choice. Nice to meet you anyway.~|~translationMissing
I want to use your whetstone.~|~translationMissing
I wanted to use your whetstone.~|~translationMissing
The whetstone is for more advanced smithing, but I could let you use it as well as my anvils if you could get me some more materials.~|~translationMissing
Mind your own business, shortstuff!~|~translationMissing
How nice to meet someone with such pleasant manners. Do come again when you need to shout at someone smaller than you!~|~translationMissing
I was just checking out the landscape.~|~translationMissing
Hope you like it. I do enjoy the solitude of my little home. If you get time, please say hi to my friends in the Dwarven Mine.~|~translationMissing
Dwarven Mine?~|~translationMissing
Yep, the entrance is in the side of Ice Mountain just to the east of here. They're a friendly bunch. Stop in at Nurmof's store and buy one of my pickaxes!~|~translationMissing
Will do!~|~translationMissing
What do you make here?~|~translationMissing
I make pickaxes. I am the best maker of pickaxes in the whole of Gielinor.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any to sell?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I've got a running order with Nurmof.~|~translationMissing
Who's Nurmof?~|~translationMissing
Nurmof has a store over in the Dwarven Mine. You can find the entrance on the side of Ice Mountain to the east of here.~|~translationMissing
Ah, fair enough.~|~translationMissing
Hey, who said you could use that? My anvils get enough work with my own use. I make pickaxes, and it takes a lot of hard work.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, would it be OK if I used your anvils?~|~translationMissing
If you could get me some more materials then I could let you use them.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I will get you materials.~|~translationMissing
I didn't want to use your anvils anyway.~|~translationMissing
That is your choice.~|~translationMissing
You should probably ask before using that.~|~translationMissing
Have you got my materials yet, traveller?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't have them all yet.~|~translationMissing
Not to worry, stick at it. Remember, I need 6 clay, 4 copper ore, and 2 iron ore.~|~translationMissing
I have everything you need!~|~translationMissing
Many thanks! Pass them here, please. I can spare you some coins for your trouble, and please use my anvils any time you want.~|~translationMissing
Clay~|~translationMissing

Guildmaster~|~translationMissing
Greetings!~|~translationMissing
This is the Champions' Guild. Only adventurers who have proved themselves worthy by gaining influence from quests are allowed in here.~|~translationMissing
Can I have a quest?~|~translationMissing
Aha!~|~translationMissing
Yes! A mighty and perilous quest fit only for the most powerful champions! And, at the end of it, you will earn the right to wear the legendary rune platebody!~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended level of 45. One or more of your skill levels are also lower than recommended.~|~translationMissing
Start the Dragon Slayer I quest?~|~translationMissing
So, what is this quest?~|~translationMissing
You'll have to speak to Oziach, the maker of rune armour. He sets the quests that champions must complete in order to wear it.~|~translationMissing
Oziach lives in a hut, by the cliffs to the west of Edgeville. He can be a little...odd...sometimes, though.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'll give it a miss.~|~translationMissing
You're already on a quest for me, if I recall correctly. Have you talked to Oziach yet?~|~translationMissing
Well, he's the only one who can grant you the right to wear rune platemail. He lives in a hut, by the cliffs west of Edgeville.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll go and talk to him.~|~translationMissing
Oziach~|~translationMissing
Aye, 'tis a fair day my friend.~|~translationMissing
Can you sell me a rune platebody?~|~translationMissing
So, how does thee know I 'ave some?~|~translationMissing
The Guildmaster of the Champions' Guild told me.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I suppose he would, wouldn't he? He's always sending you fancy-pants 'heroes' up to bother me. Telling me I'll give them a quest or sommat like that.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm not going to let just anyone wear my rune platemail. It's only for heroes. So, leave me alone.~|~translationMissing
I thought you were going to give me a quest.~|~translationMissing
*Sigh*~|~translationMissing
All right, I'll give ye a quest. I'll let ye wear my rune platemail if ye...~|~translationMissing
Slay the dragon of Crandor!~|~translationMissing
A dragon, that sounds like fun.~|~translationMissing
A dragon, that sounds like fun!~|~translationMissing
Hah, yes, you are a typical reckless adventurer, aren't you? Now go kill the dragon and get out of my face.~|~translationMissing
But how can I defeat the dragon?~|~translationMissing
Go talk to the Guildmaster in the Champions' Guild. He'll help ye out if yer so keen on doing a quest. I'm not going to be handholding any adventurers.~|~translationMissing
I may be a champion, but I don't think I'm up to dragon-killing yet.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I can understand that. Yer a coward.~|~translationMissing
That's a pity, I'm not a hero.~|~translationMissing
Aye, I ken tell!~|~translationMissing
I am a master detective.~|~translationMissing
Well, however you found out about it, I'm not going to let just anyone wear my rune platemail. It's only for heroes. So leave me alone.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm not your friend.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes, it's a very nice day.~|~translationMissing
Have ye slayed that dragon yet?~|~translationMissing
Um... no.~|~translationMissing
Be off with ye then.~|~translationMissing
I talked to Oziach...~|~translationMissing
I talked to Oziach and he gave me a quest.~|~translationMissing
Oh? What did he tell you to do?~|~translationMissing
Defeat the dragon of Crandor.~|~translationMissing
The dragon of Crandor?~|~translationMissing
Um, yes...~|~translationMissing
Goodness, he hasn't given you an easy job, has he?~|~translationMissing
What's so special about this dragon?~|~translationMissing
Thirty years ago, Crandor was a thriving community with a great tradition of mages and adventurers. Many Crandorians even earned the right to be part of the Champions' Guild!~|~translationMissing
One of their adventurers went too far, however. He descended into the volcano in the centre of Crandor and woke the dragon Elvarg.~|~translationMissing
He must have fought valiantly against the dragon because they say that, to this day, she has a scar down her side,~|~translationMissing
but the dragon still won the fight. She emerged and laid waste to the whole of Crandor with her fire breath!~|~translationMissing
Some refugees managed to escape in fishing boats. They landed on the coast, north of Rimmington, and set up camp but the dragon followed them and burned the camp to the ground.~|~translationMissing
Out of all the people of Crandor there were only three survivors~|~translationMissing
a trio of wizards who used magic to escape. Their names were Thalzar, Lozar and Melzar.~|~translationMissing
If you're serious about taking on Elvarg, first you'll need to get to Crandor. The island is surrounded by dangerous reefs, so you'll need a ship capable of getting through them and a map to show you the way.~|~translationMissing
When you reach Crandor, you'll also need some kind of protection against the dragon's breath.~|~translationMissing
How can I find the route to Crandor?~|~translationMissing
Only one map exists that shows the route through the reefs of Crandor. That map was split into three pieces by Melzar, Thalzar and Lozar, the wizards who escaped from the dragon. Each of them took one piece.~|~translationMissing
Where is Melzar's map piece?~|~translationMissing
Melzar built a castle on the site of the Crandorian refugee camp, north of Rimmington. He's locked himself in there and no one's seen him for years.~|~translationMissing
The inside of his castle is like a maze, and is populated by undead monsters. Maybe, if you could get all the way through the maze, you could find his piece of the map.~|~translationMissing
Adventurers sometimes go in there to prove themselves, so I can give you this key to Melzar's Maze.~|~translationMissing
The Guildmaster hands you a key.~|~translationMissing
Where is Thalzar's map piece?~|~translationMissing
Thalzar was the most paranoid of the three wizards. He hid his map piece and took the secret of its location to his grave.~|~translationMissing
I don't think you'd be able to find out where it is by ordinary means. You'll need to talk to the Oracle on Ice Mountain.~|~translationMissing
Where is Lozar's map piece?~|~translationMissing
A few weeks ago, I'd have told you to speak to Lozar herself, in her house across the river from Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, goblin raiders killed her and stole everything. One of the goblins from the Goblin Village probably has the map piece now.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find the right ship?~|~translationMissing
Even if you find the right route, only a ship made to the old crandorian design would be able to navigate through the reefs to the island.~|~translationMissing
If there's still one in existence, it's probably in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
Then, of course, you'll need to find a captain willing to sail to Crandor, and I'm not sure where you'd find one of them!~|~translationMissing
How can I protect myself from the dragon's breath?~|~translationMissing
That part shouldn't be too difficult, actually. I believe the Duke of Lumbridge has a special shield in his armoury that is enchanted against dragon's breath.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll get going!~|~translationMissing
On the ground floor~|~translationMissing
The wardrobe is full of heaps of dead rats!~|~translationMissing
On the first floor~|~translationMissing
The wardrobe is full of scorched and broken objects~|~translationMissing
clothes, tools, and children's toys. Each is labelled with a scrawled number. You don't see anything of value or use.~|~translationMissing
On the second floor~|~translationMissing
The wardrobe is full of heaps of bones and incomplete skeletons, each one labelled with a number.~|~translationMissing
These books are full of scrawled notes. You open one at a random page...~|~translationMissing
One excerpt from Melzar's notes is displayed.~|~translationMissing
The key disintegrates as it unlocks the door.~|~translationMissing
Melzar the Mad~|~translationMissing
By the power of custard!~|~translationMissing
Feel the wrath of my feet!~|~translationMissing
Let me drink my tea in peace.~|~translationMissing
Leave me alone, I need to feed my pet rock.~|~translationMissing
You find a map piece in the chest.~|~translationMissing
This is a piece of map that you found in Melzar's Maze. You will need to join it to the other two map pieces before you can see the route to Crandor.~|~translationMissing
I seek a piece of the map to the island of Crandor.~|~translationMissing
Oracle~|~translationMissing
The map's behind a door below, but entering is rather tough. This is what you need to know~|~translationMissing
You must use the following stuff.~|~translationMissing
First, a drink used by a mage. Next, some worm string, changed to sheet. Then, a small crustacean cage. Last, a bowl that's not seen heat.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you impart your wise knowledge to me, O Oracle?~|~translationMissing
You put the silk into the opening in the door.~|~translationMissing
You put the Lobster[sic] pot into the opening in the door.~|~translationMissing
You put the unfired bowl into the opening in the door.~|~translationMissing
You por the Wizard's Mind Bomb into the opening in the door.~|~translationMissing
The door opens...~|~translationMissing
As you open the chest, you notice an inscription on the lid~|~translationMissing
Here I rest the map to my beloved home. To whoever finds it, I beg of you, let it be. I was honour-bound not to destroy the map piece, but I have used all my magical skill to keep it from being recovered.~|~translationMissing
This map leads to the lair of the beast that destroyed my home, devoured my family, and burned to a cinder all that I love. But revenge would not benefit me now, and to disturb this beast is to risk bringing its wrath down upon another land.~|~translationMissing
I cannot stop you from taking this map piece now, but think on this~|~translationMissing
if you can slay the Dragon of Crandor, you are a greater hero than my land ever produced. There is no shame in backing out now.~|~translationMissing
This is a piece of map that you found in a secret chest in the Dwarven Mine. You will need to join it to the other two map pieces before you can see the route to Crandor.~|~translationMissing
I've heard that one of your number has got hold of part of a map.~|~translationMissing
Aha, that'd be Wormbrain.~|~translationMissing
Where would he be?~|~translationMissing
Wormbrain steals too much. He got caught. Now he lives in Port Sarim town jail.~|~translationMissing
Wormbrain~|~translationMissing
Whut you want?~|~translationMissing
I believe you've got a piece of map that I need.~|~translationMissing
I believe you've got piece of a map that I need.~|~translationMissing
So? Why should I be giving it to you? What you do for Wormbrain?~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to do anything for you. Forget it.~|~translationMissing
Be dat way then.~|~translationMissing
I'll let you live. I could just kill you.~|~translationMissing
Ha! Me in here and you out dere. You not get map piece.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I could pay you for the map piece...~|~translationMissing
I suppose I could pay you for the map piece. Say, 500 coins?~|~translationMissing
Me not stoopid, it worth at least 10,000 coins!~|~translationMissing
You must be joking! Forget it.~|~translationMissing
Fine, you not get map piece.~|~translationMissing
Alright then, 10,000 it is.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough coins~|~translationMissing
Alright then, 10,000 coins it is.~|~translationMissing
Oops, I don't have enough on me.~|~translationMissing
Comes back when you has enough.~|~translationMissing
You buy the map piece from Wormbrain.~|~translationMissing
Fank you very much! Now me can bribe da guards, hehehe.~|~translationMissing
Where did you get the map piece from?~|~translationMissing
We rob house of stupid wizard. She very old, not put up much fight at all. Hahaha!~|~translationMissing
Uh... Hahaha.~|~translationMissing
Her house full of pictures of a city on island and old pictures of people. Me not recognise island.~|~translationMissing
Me find map piece. Me not know what it is, but it in locked box so me figure it important.~|~translationMissing
But, by the time me get box open, other goblins gone. Then me not run fast enough and guards catch me.~|~translationMissing
But now you want map piece so must be special! What you do for me to get it?~|~translationMissing
What are you in for?~|~translationMissing
Me not sure. Me pick some stuff up and take it away.~|~translationMissing
Well, did the stuff belong to you?~|~translationMissing
Umm...no.~|~translationMissing
Well, that would be why then.~|~translationMissing
Oh, right.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, thought this was a zoo.~|~translationMissing
This is a piece of map that you got from Wormbrain, the goblin thief. You will need to join it to the other two map pieces before you can see the route to Crandor.~|~translationMissing
You put the three pieces together and assemble a map that shows the route through the reefs to Crandor.~|~translationMissing
Klarense~|~translationMissing
Hey, stay off my ship! That's private property!~|~translationMissing
So, are you interested in buying a ship? Now, I'll be straight with you~|~translationMissing
she's not quite seaworthy right now, but give her a bit of work and she'll be the nippiest ship this side of Port Khazard.~|~translationMissing
Do you know when she will be seaworthy?~|~translationMissing
No, not really. Port Sarim's shipbuilders aren't very efficient so it could be quite a while.~|~translationMissing
Would you take me to Crandor when she's ready?~|~translationMissing
Crandor? You're joking, right?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
Crandor's not something we sailors joke about. You can't sail from here to Catherby, or Entrana, or Ardougne without going past that accursed island.~|~translationMissing
You can't get close to it because of the reefs, but you can always see it.~|~translationMissing
Sometimes you can see a dark shape in the sky, circling the island. That's when you have to sail on as quick as you can and pray it's not hungry. Every year, more ships are lost to that dragon.~|~translationMissing
No. I want to go to Crandor.~|~translationMissing
Then you must be crazy.~|~translationMissing
That island is surrounded by reefs that would rip this ship to shreds. Even if you found a map, you'd need an experienced captain to stand a chance of getting through~|~translationMissing
and, even if I could get to it, there's no way I'm going any closer to that dragon than I have to. They say it can destroy whole ships with one bite.~|~translationMissing
Why is she damaged?~|~translationMissing
Oh, there was no particular accident. It's just years of wear and tear.~|~translationMissing
The Lady Lumbridge is an old crandorian fishing ship - the last one of her kind, as far as I know. That kind of ship was always mightily manoeuvrable, but not too tough.~|~translationMissing
She happened to be somewhere else when Crandor was destroyed, and she's had several owners since then. Not all of them have looked after her too well,~|~translationMissing
but once she's patched up, she'll be good as new!~|~translationMissing
I'd like to buy her.~|~translationMissing
Of course! I'm sure the work needed to do on it wouldn't be too expensive.~|~translationMissing
How does 2,000 gold sound? I'll even throw in my cabin boy, Jenkins, for free! He'll swab the decks and splice the mainsails for you!~|~translationMissing
Yep, sounds good.~|~translationMissing
...except I don't have that kind of money on me...~|~translationMissing
Okey dokey, she's all yours!~|~translationMissing
I'm not paying that much for a broken boat!~|~translationMissing
That's fair enough, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Ah well, never mind.~|~translationMissing
Hello, captain! Here to inspect your new ship? Just a little work and she'll be seaworthy again.~|~translationMissing
So, what needs fixing on the ship?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not fixed the ship~|~translationMissing
So, what needs fixing on this ship?~|~translationMissing
Well, the big gaping hole in the hold is the problem. You'll need a few wooden planks hammered in with steel nails to fix it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has fixed the ship~|~translationMissing
I dunno. It looks fine to me.~|~translationMissing
But you said it needed fix-~|~translationMissing
Yes, but that was before you fixed it!~|~translationMissing
Would you sail this ship to Crandor for me?~|~translationMissing
What are you going to do now you don't have a ship?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'll be fine. I've got work as Port Sarim's first lifeguard!~|~translationMissing
Can I board the ship now?~|~translationMissing
Sure thing, she's all yours.~|~translationMissing
Cabin boy Jenkins~|~translationMissing
Ahoy! What d'ye think of yer ship then?~|~translationMissing
I'm ready to go back to shore.~|~translationMissing
I'm ready to go back on shore.~|~translationMissing
You disembark from the ship.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to inspect her some more.~|~translationMissing
Aye.~|~translationMissing
Can you sail this ship to Crandor?~|~translationMissing
Not me, sir! I'm just an 'umble cabin boy. You'll need a proper cap'n.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find a captain?~|~translationMissing
The cap'ns round 'ere seem to be a mite scared of Crandor. I ask 'em why and they just say it was afore my time,~|~translationMissing
but there is one cap'n I reckon might 'elp. I 'eard there's a retired 'un who lives in Draynor Village who's so desperate to sail again 'e'd take any job.~|~translationMissing
I can't remember 'is name, but 'e lives in Draynor Village an' makes rope.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have any planks~|~translationMissing
You'll need to use wooden planks on this hole to patch it up.~|~translationMissing
If the player has planks but does not have any steel nails~|~translationMissing
You need 30 steel nails to attach the plank with.~|~translationMissing
If the player has planks and nails but does not have a hammer~|~translationMissing
You need a hammer to force the nails in with.~|~translationMissing
You nail a plank over the hole, but you still need more planks to close the hole completely.~|~translationMissing
You nail a plank over the hole, but you still need one more plank to close the hole completely.~|~translationMissing
You nail a final plank over the hole. You have successfully patched the hole in the ship.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Arrr!~|~translationMissing
Can you help me get to Crandor Island?~|~translationMissing
Arrr, matey, ye canna be serious! That be the home of Elvarg the Dragon!~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. I 've got to go there and kill the dragon for this quest I'm doing.~|~translationMissing
I canna help ye. And right sorry I be to see a fine young [laddie/lassie] like yerself go off to yer doom.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, but I'll be fine!~|~translationMissing
Arrr...~|~translationMissing
Crandor Island, ye say?~|~translationMissing
Arrr, keep yeself away from that accursed place if ye values yer skin!~|~translationMissing
So that's a 'No', then?~|~translationMissing
Aye, that it be.~|~translationMissing
Do you know anyone who would take me there?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't know many idiots. Except for young Ben there.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, get away with ye, ye scurvy scallywag!~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks anyway.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, ye may be wanting to go to Crandor Island now, but if ye gets there, ye'll be a-wantin' to get off it again quickly enough!~|~translationMissing
Aye, [laddie/lassie], it is.~|~translationMissing
There's only one sailor alive daft enough to go there. Old Ned, the ropemaker in Draynor Village. I can't think of any other fools just now. Except for old Jack Seagull there.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, who are ye calling old?~|~translationMissing
Seaman Lorris~|~translationMissing
Do you want to go on a trip to Karamja?~|~translationMissing
I'd rather go to Crandor Isle.~|~translationMissing
Seaman Lorris/Thresnor/Captain Tobias~|~translationMissing
No I need to stay alive, I have a wife and family to support.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes please.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No, thank you.~|~translationMissing
Trader Stan~|~translationMissing
Can I help you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes, who are you?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I would like to charter a ship.~|~translationMissing
Certainly [sir/madam]. Where would you like to go?~|~translationMissing
The player chooses from the map interface.~|~translationMissing
Crandor? Are you crazy?~|~translationMissing
No charter ship would take you to that island. You'd need to buy your own ship and, even then, you'd have trouble finding a captain crazy enough to go there.~|~translationMissing
Ned~|~translationMissing
Why, hello there, [lad/lass]. Me friends call me Ned. I was a man of the sea, but it's past me now. Could I be making or selling you some rope?~|~translationMissing
You're a sailor? Could you take me to Crandor?~|~translationMissing
You're a sailor? Could you take me to the island of Crandor?~|~translationMissing
Well, I was a sailor. I've not been able to get work at sea these days, though. They say I'm too old.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, where was it you said you wanted to go?~|~translationMissing
To the island of Crandor.~|~translationMissing
Crandor?~|~translationMissing
But... It would be a chance to sail a ship once more. I'd sail anywhere if it was a chance to sail again.~|~translationMissing
Then again, no captain in his right mind would sail to that island...~|~translationMissing
Ah, you only live once! I'll do it!~|~translationMissing
So, where's your ship?~|~translationMissing
It's the Lady Lumbridge, in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
That old pile of junk? Last I heard, she wasn't seaworthy.~|~translationMissing
I fixed her up!~|~translationMissing
You did? Excellent!~|~translationMissing
Just show me the map and we can get ready to go!~|~translationMissing
If the player has the completed map~|~translationMissing
You hand the map to Ned.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! I'll meet you at the ship, then.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the completed map~|~translationMissing
Uh...yeah...about that. I don't actually have a map on me.~|~translationMissing
You'd better go find it, then. I'm not going to go sailing off without a map to show me where to head!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes, I would like some rope.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No thanks, Ned. I don't need any.~|~translationMissing
Duke Horacio~|~translationMissing
Greetings. Welcome to my castle.~|~translationMissing
I seek a shield that will protect me from dragonbreath.~|~translationMissing
A knight going on a dragon quest, hmm? What dragon do you intend to slay?~|~translationMissing
Elvarg, the dragon of Crandor island!~|~translationMissing
Elvarg? Are you sure?~|~translationMissing
Well, are you sure?~|~translationMissing
Yes!~|~translationMissing
Well, you're a braver man than I!~|~translationMissing
Why is everyone so scared of this dragon?~|~translationMissing
Back in my father's day, Crandor was an important city-state. Politically, it was as important as Falador or Varrock and its ships traded with every port.~|~translationMissing
But, one day when I was little, all contact was lost. The trading ships and the diplomatic envoys just stopped coming.~|~translationMissing
I remember my father being very scared. He posted lookouts on the roof to warn if the dragon was approaching. All the city rulers were worried that Elvarg would devastate the whole continent.~|~translationMissing
I'd better leave that dragon alone.~|~translationMissing
That's a relief. I would hate to see such a promising adventurer cut down in his prime.~|~translationMissing
So, are you going to give me the shield or not?~|~translationMissing
If you really think you're up to it then perhaps you are the one who can kill this dragon.~|~translationMissing
The Duke hands you a heavy orange shield.~|~translationMissing
Take care out there. If you kill it...~|~translationMissing
If you kill it, for Saradomin's sake make sure it's really dead!~|~translationMissing
Very wise. There are some monsters that are best left alone.~|~translationMissing
Oh, no dragon in particular~|~translationMissing
Oh, no dragon in particular. I just feel like killing a dragon.~|~translationMissing
I don't have an infinite supply of these shields, you know. I'll only give one for a truly worthy cause.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you any quests for me?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Where can I find money?~|~translationMissing
Hello again, [lad/lass]. Something I can help you with? Want to buy some rope perhaps?~|~translationMissing
Will you take me to Crandor now, then?~|~translationMissing
I said I would and old Ned is a man of his word! I'll meet you on board the Lady Lumbridge in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I would like some rope.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, Ned. I don't need any.~|~translationMissing
Captain Ned~|~translationMissing
Arr, Jim lad!~|~translationMissing
It's Jenkins, cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Arr, Jenkins lad!~|~translationMissing
Shiver me timbers!~|~translationMissing
Aye aye, cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Splice the mainsail!~|~translationMissing
Swab the deck!~|~translationMissing
Weigh the anchor!~|~translationMissing
It's too heavy, cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Ah, it's good to be on board a ship again! No matter how long I live on land, a ship will always seem better. Are you ready to depart?~|~translationMissing
Yes, let's go!~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not quite ready yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, you go do whatever you need to do. I'll wait here for you until you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Ah, it's good to feel the salt spray on my face once again!~|~translationMissing
And this is a mighty fine ship. She don't look much, but she handles like a dream.~|~translationMissing
How much longer until we reach Crandor?~|~translationMissing
Not long now! According to the chart, we'd be able to see Crandor if it wasn't for those clouds on the horizon.~|~translationMissing
Clouds surround the ship.~|~translationMissing
Looks like there's a storm coming up, cap'n. Soon we won't be able to see anything!~|~translationMissing
Oh, well. The weather had been so good up until now.~|~translationMissing
Elvarg flies over the ship.~|~translationMissing
Did you see that?~|~translationMissing
See what?~|~translationMissing
I thought I saw something up above us.~|~translationMissing
Fire rains down on the ship.~|~translationMissing
It's the dragon!~|~translationMissing
Elvarg flies over the ship in circles, and rains more fire down on the ship. Cabin boy Jenkins is hit and dies instantly.~|~translationMissing
We're going to sink!~|~translationMissing
Look! Land ahead!~|~translationMissing
We're going to crash!~|~translationMissing
CRASH!~|~translationMissing
You are knocked unconscious and later awake on an ash-strewn beach.~|~translationMissing
Now I see why all the other captains said I'd be mad to go near Crandor. It looks like we're stranded.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about that. I found a secret passage in the dragon's lair that leads off the island!~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's good. I'll be able to get back to Draynor somehow,~|~translationMissing
if I can sneak past all the skeletons and demons on this island!~|~translationMissing
Wow! You sure are lucky! Seems the Lady Lumbridge just washed right up into the dock by herself!~|~translationMissing
She's pretty badly damaged, though...~|~translationMissing
You cut off Elvarg's head as proof of your victory!~|~translationMissing
I killed the dragon!~|~translationMissing
Really? That's amazing!~|~translationMissing
You are a true hero. There's no way that Oziach can refuse to sell you rune platemail now. You should tell him at once!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have!~|~translationMissing
I have its head here.~|~translationMissing
You actually did it?~|~translationMissing
I underestimated ye, adventurer. I apologise.~|~translationMissing
Yer a true hero, and I'd be happy to sell ye rune platebodies.~|~translationMissing

Alec Kincade~|~translationMissing
Greetings adventurer. Welcome to the Myths' Guild.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about the Guild.~|~translationMissing
How can I gain access to the Guild?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not meet all the requirements~|~translationMissing
Only the most worthy may access our guild and I'm afraid you are not quite there yet. Go out and hone your skills. Then you can return to us.~|~translationMissing
You do not meet all of the requirements to start the Dragon Slayer II quest.~|~translationMissing
If the player meets all the requirements~|~translationMissing
Only the most worthy are allowed access into the Myths' Guild. If you wish to enter, you'll need to prove yourself.~|~translationMissing
How can I do that?~|~translationMissing
As time passes, that which was once fact, becomes myth. Some tales are just that, tales. However, some tales are something more.~|~translationMissing
Here at the Myths' Guild, we live to tell the difference between the two. If you wish to join us, you must do the same.~|~translationMissing
So what myth would you like me to investigate?~|~translationMissing
For as long as history remembers, dragons have roamed these lands, but despite how long they've been here, much of their history remains hidden.~|~translationMissing
There are tales of course, but tales are not enough for us. We want you to discover the truth. Where did the dragons come from? Why are they here? Who do they serve?~|~translationMissing
Answer these questions for us. Help us fill our Library of Knowledge. In return, we will grant you access to the guild and you will reap the rewards within.~|~translationMissing
So, do you feel up for the challenge?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Where should I begin?~|~translationMissing
Head to Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers at Musa Point. There you'll find Dallas Jones. We've heard that he is investigating the destruction of Crandor. This seems like a good place to start.~|~translationMissing
No. This is too much for me.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. If you change your mind, you know where we are.~|~translationMissing
Greetings, adventurer. Welcome to the Myths' Guild.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about the guild.~|~translationMissing
Let's talk about my quest.~|~translationMissing
How are things progressing?~|~translationMissing
Before reaching the Ancient Doors~|~translationMissing
I'm yet to discover anything.~|~translationMissing
Well return to us once you do. If you help us fill our Library of Knowledge, we shall grant you access to the guild.~|~translationMissing
Once the player reaches the point where they must find Bob the Cat~|~translationMissing
I'm investigating the origin of Elvarg. I've found some old doors on a ruined island, but they're locked. I think something important lies behind them.~|~translationMissing
Well keep at it. If you help us fill our Library of Knowledge, we shall grant you access to the guild.~|~translationMissing
Once the player recovers Bob's memories as Robert~|~translationMissing
I'm investigating the origin of Elvarg. I've found some old doors on a ruined island, but they're locked. I'm trying to find the key.~|~translationMissing
Once the player opens the Lithkren Vault~|~translationMissing
I'm investigating the origin of Elvarg. I've found an ancient vault beneath a ruined island. I think it contains something important.~|~translationMissing
Well you'd better investigate it then. If you help us fill our Library of Knowledge, we shall grant you access to the guild.~|~translationMissing
Once Zorgoth and Galvek escape from the vault~|~translationMissing
I was investigating the origin of Elvarg but I accidently released a dragonkin!~|~translationMissing
Well that can't be good. You'd better sort that out.~|~translationMissing
I'm working on it.~|~translationMissing
Dallas Jones~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I'm [player name]. Are you Dallas Jones?~|~translationMissing
I am. Pleased to meet you. I'm assuming you're here because of my advert?~|~translationMissing
Er... yes?~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Let me run you through the details.~|~translationMissing
We're to head to Elvarg's lair beneath Crandor. There we will begin a research project on Elvarg and her attack on the island.~|~translationMissing
I trust you know the tale of Elvarg?~|~translationMissing
Well I was the one who killed her in the first place.~|~translationMissing
You're the Hero of Crandor? Amazing!~|~translationMissing
I take it you know her story very well then?~|~translationMissing
Thirty years ago, an adventurer descended into the caves beneath Crandor. There he discovered the dragon Elvarg.~|~translationMissing
Elvarg made short work of the adventurer. Once she was finished with him, she emerged from the caves and laid waste to the island.~|~translationMissing
For the next thirty years, Elvarg remained on Crandor until she was finally defeated, by you.~|~translationMissing
Now that Elvarg is dead, we have the opportunity to perform research on the island and investigate her attack.~|~translationMissing
Meet me in Elvarg's Lair beneath Crandor when you're ready to begin.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good. See you there.~|~translationMissing
Yes I know it well.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful. I won't waste your time with it then.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Dallas. So what exactly are we researching here?~|~translationMissing
Elvarg's attack on Crandor is a bit of an anomaly. We're here to work out why.~|~translationMissing
What made it an anomaly?~|~translationMissing
Elvarg is very unusual in that she is one of the few dragons to live alone. Most of her kind live in large groups.~|~translationMissing
Not only that, she also displayed far greater aggression than most other dragons by directly attacking Crandor.~|~translationMissing
But aren't all dragons aggressive?~|~translationMissing
Not like Elvarg was. Most dragons will only attack those who enter their territory. Elvarg strayed well outside of hers when she attacked the island.~|~translationMissing
I see. Where should we start?~|~translationMissing
This is where Elvarg made her home. There must be something here to point us in the right direction. Have a look around and see what you can find.~|~translationMissing
Let's talk about the investigation.~|~translationMissing
How are things going?~|~translationMissing
I've found a strange wall that looks like it might have something behind it. We might be able to mine through it.~|~translationMissing
Good work. I'm afraid you'll need to be the one to do the mining. My back isn't what it once was.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about yourself.~|~translationMissing
Not much to tell really. My name is Dallas Jones and I'm a researcher for the Varrock Museum. Many of the researchers have an area of expertise. Mine is dragons.~|~translationMissing
Why dragons?~|~translationMissing
My father used to live on Crandor before it was destroyed. He was one of the many who were killed by Elvarg.~|~translationMissing
His death left me with a great interest in dragons and I've spent the last fifteen years trying to learn more about them.~|~translationMissing
I see. Thanks, Dallas.~|~translationMissing
I've mined through a strange wall and found a tunnel behind it.~|~translationMissing
I can see that. We could well be on to something here. You go through the tunnel and see if it's safe. I'll be right behind you.~|~translationMissing
Goodness me! What is this place?~|~translationMissing
It looks like some sort of laboratory.~|~translationMissing
Are the tales true? Could this mean?~|~translationMissing
Mean what?~|~translationMissing
There are ancient tales that tell of the origin of the dragons. They say they were created by a powerful race of creatures known as the dragonkin.~|~translationMissing
Dragonkin? I've heard of them.~|~translationMissing
Yes, you likely will have. We know for a fact that the dragonkin existed. They terrorised the world for many years during the early Fourth Age.~|~translationMissing
The thing is, despite their similar names, no actual connection between the dragonkin and the dragons has ever been proven.~|~translationMissing
Well maybe we'll be the ones to prove it.~|~translationMissing
We might just be. We should look around and see what we can uncover.~|~translationMissing
I just can't believe it. This place may not just hold the secrets of Elvarg, but of the whole dragon race!~|~translationMissing
I'll look around and see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
What was that creature?~|~translationMissing
I have no idea.~|~translationMissing
How strange. We should keep looking around.~|~translationMissing
The mural has images of dragons and fungi along with the word 'Lithkren'.~|~translationMissing
You find some notes next to the machinery.~|~translationMissing
I've found an old mural. It has lots of dragons and fungi on it along with some strange writing.~|~translationMissing
What did it say?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. It looked like a different language. It had odd words on it like 'Lithkren'.~|~translationMissing
Lithkren? That name sounds familiar. Where have I seen it before?~|~translationMissing
Of course! Fossil Island! I was there recently as part of the research team investigating the differences between wyverns and dragons.~|~translationMissing
There's an old settlement on the island with similar architecture to this place. It contains lots of books, many written in a strange language. One of the books mentioned a place called Lithkren.~|~translationMissing
If the player has read the ancient diary~|~translationMissing
You know, now that you mention it, I think I may have read that book as well.~|~translationMissing
Well that just confirms it! Not to mention that Fossil Island is also coated in various types of fungi. It must be connected!~|~translationMissing
If the player has not read the ancient diary~|~translationMissing
Fossil Island is also coated in various types of fungi. It must be connected!~|~translationMissing
In that case, we should probably go to Fossil Island.~|~translationMissing
I agree. Head to the old settlement on the north side of the island. I'll meet you there once I've finished up here.~|~translationMissing
It looks like we've found everything here. We should move on to Fossil Island. I'll meet you at the old settlement on the north side of the island.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Dallas.~|~translationMissing
So while I was waiting for you, I had a look through these books again. One of them mentions a nearby island called Lithkren. Thing is, there are lots of islands around here. It doesn't say which one it is.~|~translationMissing
So how do we know which island to go to?~|~translationMissing
Have a look at this grid on the floor. I think it might actually be a map. If you look at that tile in the middle, it looks like part of this island.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... So this map could lead us to Lithkren. Most of the pieces are missing though.~|~translationMissing
That they are. However, I had a look around and I managed to find some of the pieces.~|~translationMissing
Dallas shows you some of the map pieces.~|~translationMissing
By my calculations, there are 24 pieces left to find. I suspect they'll either be in this building or very close by.~|~translationMissing
Great! I'll have a look around and see if I can find them.~|~translationMissing
Good luck. Once you have all of the pieces, bring them here and we'll see about putting this map together.~|~translationMissing
Which book was it?~|~translationMissing
Check the pile behind the ladder. You should find it there.~|~translationMissing
Have you managed to find those map pieces yet?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have map pieces on them~|~translationMissing
Well keep looking. We have [amount] pieces left to find. I suspect they'll either be in this building or very close by.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I have some here.~|~translationMissing
Great. I'll look after them for you.~|~translationMissing
If there are more pieces to find~|~translationMissing
Is that all of them?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. We have [amount] pieces left to find. I suspect they'll either be in this building or very close by.~|~translationMissing
If there are no more pieces to find~|~translationMissing
I think that's all of them.~|~translationMissing
It looks like it is. Good job.~|~translationMissing
Now then, shall we see about finishing this map?~|~translationMissing
Let's do it!~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Let me know when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
I do believe you've got it! Yes, we should be able to find Lithkren now.~|~translationMissing
But which island is it?~|~translationMissing
There's a strange symbol on the map in two places. One marks this building and the other marks an island. I bet that's Lithkren.~|~translationMissing
I think you might be right. So now that we know where the island is, we need to find a way there. Do you think the museum can help us?~|~translationMissing
The museum? No that won't work. Any requisition of museum resources requires a mountain of paperwork and we simply don't have time.~|~translationMissing
Don't we?~|~translationMissing
Of course not! Besides, I've spent years working towards this and I'm tired of waiting. It's time to discover the truth.~|~translationMissing
Alright, alright. So what do we do instead?~|~translationMissing
We'll need a boat. Find a dwarf called Jardric. He should be somewhere on the island. He's an old friend who owes me a favour. He should be able to get a boat for us.~|~translationMissing
While you're doing that, I'm going to take a copy of this map.~|~translationMissing
What should I be doing again?~|~translationMissing
We'll need a boat to get to Lithkren. Jardric should be able to help us. See if you can find him. He should be somewhere on the island.~|~translationMissing
Jardric~|~translationMissing
Are you Jardric?~|~translationMissing
That I am. Former boatman and now a researcher for Keldagrim. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I'm working with Dallas Jones on a research project. We're investigating the destruction of Crandor. We need a boat to get to one of the nearby islands. Dallas said you could help us.~|~translationMissing
Did he now? Looking to cash in on that favour I bet. I'm afraid I can't help you. All the boats around here are owned by the museum and they won't just let you take them.~|~translationMissing
Of course, Dallas works with the museum and he could easily put in a request for one, but he's not a fan of waiting around...~|~translationMissing
He said as much. So what can we do?~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose you could always build your own. If the island isn't far you'll only need a small rowboat.~|~translationMissing
Mind you, you'll want to be quite good at building things, unless you fancy a trip to the bottom of the ocean.~|~translationMissing
I'm not actually too bad when it comes to construction. What will I need?~|~translationMissing
Let's see... I'd say eight oak planks, ten swamp paste and 12 nails of any kind should do it. Obviously you'll need a hammer and a saw too.~|~translationMissing
You'll probably be wanting someone to look after the boat as well. I guess I can do that. But this means that Dallas and I are even.~|~translationMissing
There should be a good spot to build the boat on the west side of the island, near the mushroom forest.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. How's the boat coming along?~|~translationMissing
What do I need again?~|~translationMissing
You'll need a saw, a hammer, eight oak planks, ten swamp paste and 12 nails of any kind. The best place to build the boat will be on the west side of the island, near the mushroom forest.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. This should be a good place to build the boat.~|~translationMissing
You'll need a saw, a hammer, eight oak planks, ten swamp paste and 12 nails of any kind.~|~translationMissing
Well talk to Jardric if you need some help. He'll know what to do.~|~translationMissing
You successfully build the boat.~|~translationMissing
That's the boat all finished.~|~translationMissing
And not a bad boat either. Good job.~|~translationMissing
This is it. This is our chance to finally find some answers. To finally find out the truth behind Elvarg. Are you ready to go?~|~translationMissing
Player is transported to Lithkren~|~translationMissing
Look at this place! I'm going to explore and see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
Dallas departs to explore the island.~|~translationMissing
Someone's in a hurry. I suppose I should look around as well.~|~translationMissing
And I guess I'll stay here and look after the boat. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Well don't take too long. We've had to wait years for this. I don't want to wait much longer.~|~translationMissing
Well those are some big doors.~|~translationMissing
Look at them. Look at the markings on them.~|~translationMissing
Dragons?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. This is it. This has to be the place.~|~translationMissing
Shall we go in?~|~translationMissing
We can't. I already tried, but the doors are sealed. There's a circular indentation in the middle. Maybe it's a keyhole.~|~translationMissing
Well a keyhole isn't much good if there isn't a key. We should look around and see if there are any clues nearby.~|~translationMissing
Me neither.~|~translationMissing
You find an old book next to the skeleton.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not read Aivas' diary~|~translationMissing
I found an old diary nearby but I haven't read it yet.~|~translationMissing
Well read it and see what it says. It could well contain the information we need.~|~translationMissing
If the player has read Aivas' diary~|~translationMissing
I found an old diary nearby. It mentioned a battle that took place here involving Robert the Strong.~|~translationMissing
Robert the Strong? He spent most of his life fighting the dragonkin. Does this mean it's true? Did they really create the dragons?~|~translationMissing
I guess we'll never know though. Robert the Strong is gone. We've reached a dead end.~|~translationMissing
Not necessarily. Robert the Strong might not be as dead as you think.~|~translationMissing
Robert the Strong is still alive. He's been reincarnated as a cat called Bob.~|~translationMissing
Just think once before you speak please.~|~translationMissing
I'm serious! Why would I lie about this?~|~translationMissing
Well I'm definitely not convinced, but let's say you're telling the truth... how can a cat help us?~|~translationMissing
I have an amulet that lets me talk to cats. I can use it to ask Bob what he knows.~|~translationMissing
This is all very confusing. You go find this cat of yours. I need to sit down and clear my head of all this weirdness.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I shall return once I've learnt more.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Have you found that cat yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet I'm afraid. He likes to move around a lot.~|~translationMissing
Well keep at it. We need to get through these doors.~|~translationMissing
Hey, Bob!~|~translationMissing
Bob~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. How's things?~|~translationMissing
Not bad. I was wondering if you could help me with something.~|~translationMissing
So you know how you're actually Robert the Strong?~|~translationMissing
So you and the Sphinx tell me.~|~translationMissing
Long story, I'll keep it brief. I found an old dungeon with a large set of doors in it. There was a skeleton nearby with a diary that mentioned Robert the Strong.~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you could use your memories of Robert the Strong to help me open the doors.~|~translationMissing
But I don't have any memories of Robert the Strong. It was only when the Sphinx hypnotised me that we learnt who I really was and I don't even remember that.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... This is problematic.~|~translationMissing
Maybe the Sphinx can help us again.~|~translationMissing
Well it worked last time.~|~translationMissing
That it did. Bob, would you mind meeting me in Sophanem?~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose I don't have anything better to do. Not unless Unferth has forgotten where he lives again.~|~translationMissing
Neite~|~translationMissing
Ahem.~|~translationMissing
Oh fudge. Give me one moment, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Bob and Neite have a quiet conversation with each other.~|~translationMissing
Well that all sounds great to me, [player name]. I'll meet you in Sophanem.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, Bob.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. I'm on my way to Sophanem to see the Sphinx.~|~translationMissing
Great! I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, Neite.~|~translationMissing
Where's Bob?~|~translationMissing
He's meant to be with you. You haven't lost him have you?~|~translationMissing
Well keep an eye on him for me.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What are you doing?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you talk to the Sphinx much?~|~translationMissing
Ask the Sphinx for help with Bob's memories.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing a catspeak amulet~|~translationMissing
I should probably wear my catspeak amulet before talking to Bob and the Sphinx.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing a catspeak amulet~|~translationMissing
Sphinx~|~translationMissing
Hello, human. Bob was just telling me about your dungeon.~|~translationMissing
That's right. Before we get into that though, about that thing I mentioned...~|~translationMissing
Thing?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. That amulet of yours is very useful, but it has limitations. I can use my power to grant you the ability to talk to cats even when you're not wearing it.~|~translationMissing
Very few humans are ever given this power, but you've proven yourself to be a friend to feline kind.~|~translationMissing
I'm very honoured.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Prepare yourself!~|~translationMissing
You feel a strange tingling as the Sphinx casts her enchantment upon you.~|~translationMissing
All done. Now, what is it you need my help with?~|~translationMissing
We were hoping you could hypnotise Bob again so we can learn more about his past.~|~translationMissing
What is it you wish to learn?~|~translationMissing
It's about that dungeon. I believe that it was once visited by Robert the Strong. I want to know what he did while he was there.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I will be of little help here. All I can do is hypnotise Bob. I can't enter his mind and choose which memory to view.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Enter his mind...~|~translationMissing
What are you thinking, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I once entered the mind of a guy called Cyrisus to confront some personal issues of his. The Oneiromancer on Lunar Isle helped me do it. Maybe she can help us now.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll join you there. That's going to be a long walk on these paws.~|~translationMissing
I'm not ready to set out yet. You go on ahead. I'll meet you on Lunar Isle and we'll ask the Oneiromancer to help us.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, [player name]. The Oneiromancer and I were just discussing what our perfect Sunday would be.~|~translationMissing
I didn't know you two knew each other. Also, how can you speak to cats?~|~translationMissing
Oneiromancer~|~translationMissing
You know it's really not that hard. You just need a bit of magic on your side. Anyway, Bob and I go way back.~|~translationMissing
Huh... small world.~|~translationMissing
So what was it you wanted?~|~translationMissing
We need to unlock Bob's memories from his old life as Robert the Strong. We were hoping that we could use a shared dream.~|~translationMissing
Well we've never actually done a shared dream between a human and a cat before, but it shouldn't be any different. You'll just need another Potion of Shared Dreaming.~|~translationMissing
Would you like me to remind you how they are made?~|~translationMissing
I'll give you a vial. You'll need to fill it with water, followed by one ground astral rune and some goutweed.~|~translationMissing
Once you've done that, light the brazier in the middle of town. When you're ready to begin your dream, just use the potion on the brazier.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a free inventory space~|~translationMissing
You'll need to make some room in your inventory for this vial. Come back to me when you have.~|~translationMissing
Here's a vial for your potion. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a dream vial.)~|~translationMissing
You should get to work on making that potion.~|~translationMissing
Hi, Bob! I've finished the Potion of Shared Dreaming.~|~translationMissing
How can I gain access to the guild?~|~translationMissing
Good stuff. Take it to the brazier in the middle of town and we can begin the dream.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. What do you want to talk about?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) The state of the island.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Cyrisus.~|~translationMissing
Bob's memories.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a dream vial~|~translationMissing
Take the vial I gave you and fill it with water. After that, add one ground astral rune and some goutweed.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Nothing.~|~translationMissing
I've made the Potion of Shared Dreaming.~|~translationMissing
In that case you should take it to the brazier in the middle of town.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not lit up the Ceremonial Brazier~|~translationMissing
Good stuff. Light the brazier then add the potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lit up the Ceremonial Brazier~|~translationMissing
Good stuff. Add the potion to the brazier and we can begin.~|~translationMissing
Ready, Bob?~|~translationMissing
Ready when you are, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to enter the dream?~|~translationMissing
Player and Bob enter the dream.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. Shall we go back into the dream again?~|~translationMissing
Not Bob~|~translationMissing
Who are you?~|~translationMissing
Well one thing's for sure, I'm definitely Not Bob.~|~translationMissing
Okay... so who are you then?~|~translationMissing
I just told you, I'm Not Bob.~|~translationMissing
Well this is confusing.~|~translationMissing
These dreams usually are.~|~translationMissing
So Not Bob, why are you here?~|~translationMissing
You tell me. It's your mind we're in right now.~|~translationMissing
We're here to recover Bob's lost memories from his life as Robert the Strong. Do you think you can help us?~|~translationMissing
I suppose I can. This barrier represents the divide between Bob the Cat and Robert the Strong. The memories you seek are right here, on the other side of the barrier.~|~translationMissing
So all we need to do is go through the barrier?~|~translationMissing
Going through the barrier will give you access to Robert's memories, but only while you're in the dream. As soon as you leave, you'll forget them again.~|~translationMissing
So how can we permanently unlock them?~|~translationMissing
Destroying the barrier of course. Head through the barrier and defeat the guardian. That should do the trick.~|~translationMissing
Defeat the guardian? I'm no good at combat... I'm a cat.~|~translationMissing
Good job this is a shared dream then. It doesn't have to be you that defeats him.~|~translationMissing
Looks like it's up to me then. Wish me luck.~|~translationMissing
Good luck, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Apparently you need to defeat the guardian on the other side of this barrier. Sounds odd to me, but what do I know.~|~translationMissing
Pass through the barrier and defeat the guardian. That should restore Bob's lost memories.~|~translationMissing
I remember! Lithkren! The dragonkin! The vault!~|~translationMissing
Flashback starts~|~translationMissing
Dragonkin~|~translationMissing
Robert! I should have known that this would be your doing.~|~translationMissing
Robert the Strong~|~translationMissing
It's over dragonkin. The island is ours. You have lost.~|~translationMissing
Lost? This is no more than a minor setback. The work we have done here will see the end of your kind. You are too late to stop it.~|~translationMissing
Aivas~|~translationMissing
And what work might that be?~|~translationMissing
Our new weapon. One that will bring a swift end to humanity. I'd love to be able to show you, but I'm afraid I have more pressing matters.~|~translationMissing
Camorra~|~translationMissing
Like dying perhaps?~|~translationMissing
You'd like that, wouldn't you? Alas, I'm afraid that I won't be the one that dies today.~|~translationMissing
Tristan~|~translationMissing
We'll see about that.~|~translationMissing
Yes we will, for this is where it begins.~|~translationMissing
No. This is where it ends.~|~translationMissing
The heroes begin to fight the dragonkin. Aivas is killed instantly upon the dragonkin attacking him.~|~translationMissing
Aivas!~|~translationMissing
You'll pay for that!~|~translationMissing
The heroes continue the assault, eventually defeating the dragonkin, who drops a dragon key.~|~translationMissing
Looks like some sort of key. For these doors I assume.~|~translationMissing
Should we open them?~|~translationMissing
No. That dragonkin mentioned a weapon. One that could destroy us all. Better something like that remains hidden... for now.~|~translationMissing
Robert picks up the key, and the flashback ends.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing, Bob?~|~translationMissing
I've got a lot to take in and understand, but I'm okay.~|~translationMissing
So do you have all of your memories back now?~|~translationMissing
Yes and no. I now have my old memories again, but there are so many of them. I can't quite piece them all together yet. I need time to properly work things out.~|~translationMissing
However, one thing that I do remember clearly is that battle. I also remember what happened next.~|~translationMissing
So what did happen?~|~translationMissing
After the battle, myself, Tristan and Camorra split the key into four pieces. We vowed to ensure that the dragonkin would never recover them, and to only return once the war was won.~|~translationMissing
But you never did?~|~translationMissing
No. In the end, we went our seperate ways. Of the four pieces, Camorra took one, Tristan took another and I took the final two.~|~translationMissing
Camorra eventually boarded a ship for lands to the far west, never to be seen again. She took her key piece with her.~|~translationMissing
Tristan passed his piece on to his descendants. They lived in the city of Saranthium, where Varrock now stands. Perhaps the Varrock Library has some record of them.~|~translationMissing
I hid one of my pieces in the most unlikely of places, an abandoned dragonkin fortress. You'll find the fortress on a snow covered island, north west of Rellekka.~|~translationMissing
The final piece I took to Karamja. I hid it in an ancient temple on the south coast of the island.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like I have a fair amount of work to do. Thanks, Bob.~|~translationMissing
With the dragonkin long gone, the vault should be safe to open. That said, you should still be cautious, [player name].~|~translationMissing
The scars of our war with the dragonkin remain to this day, and the weapon in that vault could still be very dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll be careful.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Hi, Bob. Could you remind me where those key pieces are?~|~translationMissing
The key was split into four different pieces. Camorra took one piece, Tristan took another and I took the final two.~|~translationMissing
Camorra boarded a ship for lands to the far west, never to be seen again. She took her key piece with her.~|~translationMissing
Ask about Tristan.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I was wondering if you could help me with something?~|~translationMissing
Reldo~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for information on a Fourth Age hero. His name was Tristan and he fought alongside Robert the Strong.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you must mean Tristan Corvo. I can't remember anyone ever asking about him before. Most prefer to hear about the bigger heroes like Arrav or Robert.~|~translationMissing
But you know about Tristan?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. What was it you wanted to learn?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to learn about his descendants. I know they lived in this area.~|~translationMissing
Well we do have census records which date back to when the city was still called Avarrocka, but I'm afraid we don't have anything from before that time.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... It might still be worth a look. Where can I find this information?~|~translationMissing
I have a book around here somewhere with all of the details. Why don't you see if you can find it? It's red if I remember right.~|~translationMissing
Have you found that book yet?~|~translationMissing
I know it's around here somewhere. It's red if I remember right.~|~translationMissing
You find an interesting looking book.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Let's have a look.~|~translationMissing
You hand the book to Reldo.~|~translationMissing
So what does the book say?~|~translationMissing
Okay let's see... The Corvo family... Here we are! According to this, there was a family by the name of Corvo living in Avarrocka for most of the Fourth Age.~|~translationMissing
The last entry is from the year 1770 of the Fourth Age.~|~translationMissing
What happened to them?~|~translationMissing
Impossible to say for sure, but it was around that time that many people left Misthalin to settle in Morytania. It's possible that the Corvo family was among them.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that's all the help I can provide. Port Phasmatys is where most of the Morytania settlers wound up. Perhaps you'll find what you're looking for there.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks Reldo.~|~translationMissing
Did you have any luck finding the Corvo family?~|~translationMissing
Port Phasmatys might be a good place to look. It's where most of the Morytania settlers wound up.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Do you know anyone with the name Corvo?~|~translationMissing
Ghost villager~|~translationMissing
Sarah Corvo? She lives in the house next to the bank.~|~translationMissing
Of course. I'm Sarah Corvo. Not many people interested in visiting me these days. What brings you here?~|~translationMissing
I'm on the hunt for the piece of a key. It was once in the possession of your ancestor, Tristan Corvo.~|~translationMissing
I see. I'm afraid I can't help you. The key piece is gone.~|~translationMissing
Gone?~|~translationMissing
Yes gone. When my father passed the key piece down to me, he told me that I must keep it safe no matter what. When the vampyres came to Port Phasmatys, I buried it out in the swamps to stop them getting it.~|~translationMissing
But how do I get it back?~|~translationMissing
You don't. The key piece is gone and it's safer that way. I never liked looking after that red lump of metal anyway.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I think I might know just the scientist to help me out with this. Time for me to visit Draynor Manor.~|~translationMissing
What was that?~|~translationMissing
Oh, nothing. I'd best be off. Thank you for your time.~|~translationMissing
You again. You're not still after that key piece are you?~|~translationMissing
Nope. Just stopping by to say hello.~|~translationMissing
Well that was great. See you later.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Are you after another device, or some information, or would you like to see my goods for sale?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Devices, please.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'd like information, please.~|~translationMissing
I need your help with a key piece.~|~translationMissing
A key piece?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'm looking for the piece of a key made out of red metal. I know it's buried somewhere in Mort Myre Swamp, but I don't know exactly where. I was thinking...~|~translationMissing
You were thinking that because I made you a metal attracting device before that I'd be able to do it again.~|~translationMissing
Er... yeah, pretty much.~|~translationMissing
Should be doable. Will need to be quite different to your device though. Much greater distance and a different type of metal. You said it was red, right?~|~translationMissing
Yes it's...~|~translationMissing
Must be orikalkum. Dragon as you adventuring lot call it. Quite rare. Should make things easier. Now let me think about this... If we just... hmm... yes... perfect!~|~translationMissing
Perfect?~|~translationMissing
Go get one cut dragonstone and two molten glass. Use a glassblowing pipe to craft a glass orb with the dragonstone in the centre. Once you have it, bring it to me. Any questions? Good. Bye.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'd like to see your stuff for sale, please.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll just head off, I think.~|~translationMissing
Have you crafted that orb yet?~|~translationMissing
You adventurers are so forgetful. You'll need one cut dragonstone and two molten glass. Use a glassblowing pipe to craft a glass orb with the dragonstone in the centre. When you're done, bring it back here.~|~translationMissing
I have indeed.~|~translationMissing
You hand the orb to Ava.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Now just a few small adjustments and...~|~translationMissing
Ava gives you the finished locator orb.~|~translationMissing
Here you go. You can use this to track down that key piece of yours.~|~translationMissing
Great! How does it work?~|~translationMissing
The orb will pull you in the direction of the key piece, but be careful with it. It's a little unstable.~|~translationMissing
Awesome! That's just... Wait... what do you mean unstable?~|~translationMissing
Nothing to get worried about. It might just sting a bit when you use it.~|~translationMissing
Er... great? Anyway, before I go I was wondering...~|~translationMissing
If I could upgrade that device of yours?~|~translationMissing
Well now that you mention it...~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Might be possible. The chicken is the weakness at the moment. If you find something with a bit more kick, I might be able to upgrade it further.~|~translationMissing
Bit more kick?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Something a bit stronger. A bit more undead.~|~translationMissing
Okay... Thanks for the help Ava. See you later.~|~translationMissing
I already made you a locator orb. What else do you need?~|~translationMissing
If the player has an orb already~|~translationMissing
How does it work?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost their orb~|~translationMissing
Don't get mad.~|~translationMissing
You lost it, didn't you?~|~translationMissing
Yeah...~|~translationMissing
Well luckily for you, I made a spare. Please try to look after this one.~|~translationMissing
Ava gives you a locator orb.~|~translationMissing
Gujuo~|~translationMissing
Good day, Bwana. The Kharazi jungle is especially beautiful today, isn't it?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have any news?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Where are all your people?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for an ancient temple.~|~translationMissing
A temple? There's an old dungeon in the south east corner of the jungle. Could this be what you seek, Bwana?~|~translationMissing
It may well be. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
I must warn you, Bwana, that place is dangous. Many of our people have entered and never returned.~|~translationMissing
It can never be easy can it? Okay, I'll be careful. Thanks again.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I've lost the totem pole you gave me.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Okay, thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
Did you try that dungeon in the south east corner of the jungle, Bwana?~|~translationMissing
I didn't. I'll look there. Thank you.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask about a Seal of Passage.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask about the mountain camp.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask about V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the dragonkin fortress.~|~translationMissing
Brundt the Chieftain~|~translationMissing
Greetings, [Fremennik name]. How are things?~|~translationMissing
Hello, Brundt. I wanted to ask you about something.~|~translationMissing
Well ask away, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Apparently there's an island north of here with an ancient fortress on it. Have you heard of it?~|~translationMissing
I think I know of this island. Ungael, we call it. It is a dark place, guarded by a deadly beast. Some of our finest warriors tried to take the beast down, but to no success.~|~translationMissing
Do you intend to slay this beast for yourself, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
Er... yes, I think I do.~|~translationMissing
This is no easy task, [Fremennik name], but glory awaits you if you succeed.~|~translationMissing
Go see Torfinn on the docks. He can take you to Ungael. Good luck, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
If the player is exiled~|~translationMissing
Will he talk to me while I'm exiled?~|~translationMissing
He should do. Just tell him I sent you.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask about anything else.~|~translationMissing
Greetings, [Fremennik name]. Have you destroyed that beast yet?~|~translationMissing
Well if you speak to Torfinn on the docks he will take you to Ungael. Good luck, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
If the player is not exiled~|~translationMissing
Torfinn~|~translationMissing
Good day to you, [Fremennik name]. How can I help you?~|~translationMissing
The chieftain says you can take me to Ungael.~|~translationMissing
That I can. You should know though, Ungael is a dangerous place. It is guarded by a deadly foe, one that spits fire at its enemies.~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't really be talking to you [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
I know but the Chieftain says you can take me to Ungael.~|~translationMissing
Well if the Chieftain says it's okay then I guess I can. You should know though, Ungael is a dangerous place. It is guarded by a deadly force, one that spits fire at its enemies.~|~translationMissing
Spits fire? Sounds like some sort of fire protection might be useful.~|~translationMissing
So, [Fremennik name], are you ready to go to Ungael?~|~translationMissing
Then we shall go.~|~translationMissing
The player is transported to Ungael~|~translationMissing
I will be here when you are.~|~translationMissing
Good day to you, [Fremennik name]. Do you want to go to Ungael?~|~translationMissing
I'm not meant to be talking to you [Fremennik name]. I guess I can still take you to Ungael though if you want.~|~translationMissing
No thank you.~|~translationMissing
Hey there! Do you need something?~|~translationMissing
Have you ever heard of Camorra?~|~translationMissing
Camorra? What's a Camorra?~|~translationMissing
She was an ancient hero who lived about two thousand years ago. I believe she travelled here at some point.~|~translationMissing
An ancient hero? Sounds like the Library Historical Archive is where you want to be. Talk to Archeio in the Arceuus Library. He can take you there.~|~translationMissing
Great. Thank you.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm good.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. Did you try the Library Historical Archive?~|~translationMissing
I suggest you try there. Talk to Archeio in the Arceuus Library. He can take you there.~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about Camorra?~|~translationMissing
I think I have heard that name before. Who is she?~|~translationMissing
She was a hero who lived around two thousand years ago.~|~translationMissing
I see. We have very few records from before the founding of Kourend. That said, perhaps Imerominia could help you? As a horologist, such ancient topics may fall within her purview.~|~translationMissing
Is there something else I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
Hello. What do you do here?~|~translationMissing
Imerominia~|~translationMissing
Hello. My name is Imerominia and I'm the library horologist.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Horologist? What does that mean?~|~translationMissing
I can't say I have. Who is she?~|~translationMissing
She's a hero from around two thousand years ago. I believe she travelled to Kourend during the Dragonkin Conflicts. I was hoping to learn more about her.~|~translationMissing
Two thousand years ago? That's long before the founding of Kourend. I'm afraid we have very few records from those times here.~|~translationMissing
Oh. So you can't help me?~|~translationMissing
I can't, but someone might be able to. The five cities of Kourend were founded long before the kingdom itself. Each city has their own historian who might have more information on the early days of their city.~|~translationMissing
Great. Is there a particular city you'd recommend?~|~translationMissing
Hosidius and Shayzien were the two cities founded during the Dragonkin Conflicts. They might be the best ones to start with. The other cities were founded much earlier, during the God Wars.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find the Hosidius and Shayzien historians?~|~translationMissing
Jonathan is the Hosidius historian. He lives west of the Hosidius General Store. Amelia is the Shayzien historian. She lives south west of the Shayzien Pub.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
I have not. Did you try talking to the Hosidius and Shayzien historians about her.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find them again?~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Have you heard of Camorra?~|~translationMissing
Jonathan~|~translationMissing
Camorra. She was a great hero who fought in the Dragonkin Conflicts. I think she travelled to Kourend during the war. I'm trying to find out what happened to her.~|~translationMissing
A hero? Well she wouldn't have had much to do with Hosidius. The early Hosidius settlers were all pacificts. They'd have stayed away from people like her.~|~translationMissing
Oh well. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Amelia~|~translationMissing
Hello. Can I help you?~|~translationMissing
Have you heard of Camorra?~|~translationMissing
Not that I remember.~|~translationMissing
Well she was a great hero during the Dragonkin Conflicts. I think she travelled to Kourend before the war ended. I'm trying to find out more about her.~|~translationMissing
Well Shayzien was founded by those fleeing the Dragonkin Conflicts, and the city has never been short of heroes. There's a good chance she was connected to Shayzien in some way.~|~translationMissing
But you've never heard of her?~|~translationMissing
No, but that's not surprising. Much of our history was lost during Xeric's reign. However, there is somewhere you might find answers.~|~translationMissing
Where's that?~|~translationMissing
The Shayzien Crypts. They were built before the kingdom even existed. Some of the oldest Shayzien heroes are buried there.~|~translationMissing
Let me guess... there's a catch isn't there?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid so. For hundreds of years, the crypts have been overrun by the dead. We've tried clearing them out, but they just come back again.~|~translationMissing
Well thankfully I ain't afraid of no ghosts. Where do I start?~|~translationMissing
They're zombies and skeletons, not ghosts. You'll find the entrance to the crypts in the Graveyard of Heroes, west of here. Be careful.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for the help.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure we've already spoken about this.~|~translationMissing
We probably have. I'm very forgetful.~|~translationMissing
The most likely place to find answers is the Shayzien Crypts. You'll find the entrance in the Graveyard of Heroes, west of here. Be careful, it's filled with zombies and skeletons.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, [player name].~|~translationMissing
How's it going, Bob?~|~translationMissing
Now that I've started to regain my memories, I find myself hungry for answers. I'd like to see for myself what these doors guard.~|~translationMissing
Well we'll be finding out very soon. I've managed to fix the key.~|~translationMissing
Let's see if it works then.~|~translationMissing
I've managed to repair the key.~|~translationMissing
Well no point waiting around. Let's get these doors open.~|~translationMissing
Oh my!~|~translationMissing
That is one big dragon!~|~translationMissing
This isn't right... We've made a mistake. We need to leave now!~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. The camera pans towards the sleeping dragon, with the player, Bob, and Dallas seen from behind.~|~translationMissing
Magnificent isn't he?~|~translationMissing
His name is Galvek. In our tongue, it means...~|~translationMissing
The player, Bob, and Dallas turn around as camera pans towards the voice, revealing a dragonkin.~|~translationMissing
Fate.~|~translationMissing
You! I remember you. Zorgoth.~|~translationMissing
Zorgoth~|~translationMissing
Hello, Robert. You've had quite the makeover.~|~translationMissing
You should be dead.~|~translationMissing
We dragonkin are not as flimsy as you. I'm afraid you failed.~|~translationMissing
You're a dragonkin?~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see you brought your friend with you. I'm surprised to see you here after all this time. Curious...~|~translationMissing
What do you...~|~translationMissing
Hello there, dragonkin.~|~translationMissing
You I don't recognise. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm Dallas Jones, and I came here for answers.~|~translationMissing
Is that so? Then tell me, Dallas Jones, what answers do you seek?~|~translationMissing
I want to know the truth about Elvarg, about Crandor.~|~translationMissing
Elvarg? Crandor? These names mean nothing to me.~|~translationMissing
Elvarg was a dragon who attacked the island of Crandor. We found a lab hidden in her lair. We followed the clues and they led us here, to you.~|~translationMissing
You gave her a name? I never bothered. She was nothing.~|~translationMissing
Nothing? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
After your failed attempt on my life, I realised that we were starting to lose the war against your kind. We needed to turn the tide. We needed a new weapon.~|~translationMissing
The creature you call Elvarg was the first. An attempt to create a being which would crush humanity once and for all. She was a failure. Too weak. Pathetic.~|~translationMissing
We moved on. We tried various other methods, all ending in disappointment. In the end, we came here. Our largest facility yet. Here we began work on what would become our masterpiece.~|~translationMissing
But we got here first.~|~translationMissing
An annoying setback. When you attacked, I had this place sealed, to keep our work safe. My people were to return after the attack and release me again.~|~translationMissing
But we killed them before they could leave.~|~translationMissing
I suspected as much. However, it turned out quite well for me in the end. I have been sealed here for hundreds of years, alone and without disturbance. More than enough time for me to perfect our salvation.~|~translationMissing
Galvek.~|~translationMissing
Yes. He has power that no other dragon has. The power to influence the minds of other dragons. Through him, an army will be raised. One that will annihilate humanity.~|~translationMissing
Why? You attacked us. Tried to destroy us. You took away our homes, our people. Were we expected to stand by and watch?~|~translationMissing
We were defending ourselves. You threatened to destroy us all.~|~translationMissing
Not all of us. Only a few gave in to the anger of the curse. Only a few waged war on you. But you were not willing to distinguish. And now, neither am I.~|~translationMissing
Humanity is a disease. You have just unleashed the cure.~|~translationMissing
Do you really think we're letting you leave this place?~|~translationMissing
I don't think you have a choice. Let me show you...~|~translationMissing
Awaken!~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins, the screen shaking. The ceiling begins to crumble as debris falls onto the floor.~|~translationMissing
It's moving!~|~translationMissing
Galvek is awakened off-camera, and attacks Dallas, killing him instantly.~|~translationMissing
Dallas!~|~translationMissing
The player carries Bob and runs toward the camera.~|~translationMissing
Both~|~translationMissing
The camera pans towards Galvek, now moving towards the camera. The scene then cuts to the player and Bob, the former performing the panic emote.~|~translationMissing
We'd better go!~|~translationMissing
The scene transitions to Jardric by the Ancient Doors, where debris continues falling onto the floor.~|~translationMissing
What's happening?~|~translationMissing
The scene transitions to Galvek and Zorgoth, preparing their grand escape.~|~translationMissing
Jardric fires his crossbow at Galvek.~|~translationMissing
You dare!~|~translationMissing
Zorgoth casts stun on Jardric, knocking him back off-camera.~|~translationMissing
The doors are unlocked! Release us!~|~translationMissing
The camera pans to Galvek from behind facing the Ancient Doors, firing a large blast of fire that covers the screen. The scene transitions to outside the Ancient Doors, and Galvek flies upwards, ending the cutscene.~|~translationMissing
That really hurt!~|~translationMissing
It looks like we may have a slight problem on our hands.~|~translationMissing
What do we do? That dragonkin said he was going to assemble an army of dragons!~|~translationMissing
This is too much for just us to deal with. We're going to need some help.~|~translationMissing
Any suggestions?~|~translationMissing
King Roald commands one of the largest armies in the world. He's probably a good starting point.~|~translationMissing
Good plan. I'll go see the King.~|~translationMissing
And I'll get in touch with Keldagrim. Maybe they can help us.~|~translationMissing
Bob and Jardric depart.~|~translationMissing
Talk about the dragon threat.~|~translationMissing
Greetings, your majesty.~|~translationMissing
King Roald~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Do you need something?~|~translationMissing
I'm here to talk about dragons.~|~translationMissing
If you mean the dragons that have been spotted flying around, we're well aware. I have my best people investigating this and we will make sure the citizens are safe. Now, be on your way.~|~translationMissing
Wait! I know what the dragons are doing.~|~translationMissing
Yes. There's a dragonkin named Zorgoth who has managed to bring them under his control. He is forming an army which he intends to use to attack humanity!~|~translationMissing
A dragonkin? That's preposterous. The dragonkin have been dead for hundreds of years.~|~translationMissing
I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me! Why else would the dragons be acting so odd?~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose you've been a friend to Varrock in the past. What would you ask of us?~|~translationMissing
You need to gather your soldiers. We have to destroy this dragon threat before it destroys us.~|~translationMissing
Aeonisig Raispher~|~translationMissing
Gather the soldiers? My lord, do you know what this means?~|~translationMissing
Of course I know what it means. But this citizen is right, we have no choice.~|~translationMissing
But my lord...~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Darkness of Hallowvale~|~translationMissing
Enough. This enemy is threatening us directly and we must respond.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Darkness of Hallowvale~|~translationMissing
Enough. This isn't like Morytania. There is no godly involvement here. This enemy is threatening us directly and we must respond.~|~translationMissing
I will make the necessary preparations. In the meantime, citizen, you will visit King [Lathas/Thoros], Chieftain Brundt and Sir Amik Varze. Tell them to come to Varrock to discuss the dragon threat.~|~translationMissing
Chieftain Brundt? You would ally with those barbarians?~|~translationMissing
For Saradomin's sake! They have ships and they have soldiers! We need them on our side.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Regicide but has not completed Song of the Elves~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure if we want King Lathas on our side.~|~translationMissing
You as well? Put your petty disagreements aside and look at the big picture. We must all work together if we are to survive.~|~translationMissing
Now, you should get moving. Time is not on our side. While you're gone, I'll have Aeonisig reach out to some other people as well. We need all the help we can get.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Have you spoken to the other leaders yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. Who am I meant to be speaking to again?~|~translationMissing
Talk to King [Lathas/Thoros], Chieftain Brundt and Sir Amik Varze. Tell them that they are needed in Varrock to discuss the dragon threat. Now hurry up and get it done.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Sir Amik.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I assume you mean all these dragons that have been flying around. Do you know something?~|~translationMissing
I do. It's not good I'm afraid. The dragons are uniting under a dragonkin named Zorgoth. He intends to use them against us.~|~translationMissing
I thought all the dragonkin were dead!~|~translationMissing
History says they are a formidable enemy. Do you have a plan to combat this threat?~|~translationMissing
King Roald is forming an army to take on the dragons. He's requested your presence in Varrock to discuss this.~|~translationMissing
Very well, I shall head to Varrock. Thank you for passing on this message.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I will be leaving for Varrock soon.~|~translationMissing
I'll see you there.~|~translationMissing
Good day my lord.~|~translationMissing
Greetings. Do you require something?~|~translationMissing
I wanted to talk to you about some dragons.~|~translationMissing
We've had various reports come in about a sudden increase in dragon activity. I assume this is what you're referring to?~|~translationMissing
It is. The increase in activity is caused by a dragonkin called Zorgoth. He's forming an army of dragons to destroy humanity with.~|~translationMissing
I see. I will ensure our forces are ready to fight back against this threat.~|~translationMissing
You need not fight it alone. King Roald is preparing his own men and would like you to fight with him. A meeting is to be held in Varrock to plan the defence.~|~translationMissing
An alliance with King Roald? Interesting. We have no quarrel with Misthalin. I accept.~|~translationMissing
Great. I'll see you in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
King Thoros~|~translationMissing
On behalf of everyone in Ardougne, I thank you for your help adventurer. I'm afraid I don't have time to talk, my predecessor has left me with a lot of work to do.~|~translationMissing
I appreciate you're busy, but I wanted to talk to you about some dragons.~|~translationMissing
Leave the king alone.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the dragon threat.~|~translationMissing
Greetings, [Fremennik name]. Have you seen those beasts flying towards Ungael? Might be best to stay clear of that place for a while.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Brundt. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.~|~translationMissing
Let me guess, you intend to take these beasts on?~|~translationMissing
You are a true warrior, [Fremennik name], though I fear this may be too much even for you. You are heavily outnumbered.~|~translationMissing
I don't plan on doing it alone. I have the support of King Roald. I was hoping you'd help as well.~|~translationMissing
Fight alongside outerlanders? That is not typically our way, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
I understand. However, these dragons are threatening humanity as a whole. We must fight back.~|~translationMissing
Well let it not be said that the Fremennik turned away from a good fight. You have our support. Maybe we'll show your outerlander friends a thing or two!~|~translationMissing
The council won't be happy. I'll tell them we're doing it to show your outerlander friends how to fight. That should convince them.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, Brundt. There is to be a meeting in Varrock to discuss our plan of action. It would be good if you could attend.~|~translationMissing
Pah! Outerlanders and their meetings. I will attend, but this better not take long. We have dragons to kill!~|~translationMissing
Hello, Brundt. Are you ready for the meeting in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
I shall be heading there soon, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
In that case, I'll see you there.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Bob.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. How's it going?~|~translationMissing
I've arranged a meeting with King Roald and some other rulers. We're going to discuss how to combat the dragons.~|~translationMissing
It's not the dragons I'm worried about, [player name]. It's Zorgoth.~|~translationMissing
We'll beat him.~|~translationMissing
I hope you're right. You'd better head in and get this meeting done. Come talk to me once it's finished. There's something we need to discuss.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Jardric.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. While you were arranging this meeting I spoke to the Consortium in Keldagrim. I'm afraid they won't be helping us.~|~translationMissing
Well we still have Roald and the other rulers.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Speaking of which, you should head on in. The meeting will be starting soon.~|~translationMissing
Good work gathering the other leaders. The meeting will begin shortly. Head into the dining room when you are ready.~|~translationMissing
Thank you all for coming. As I'm sure you are aware, we are facing one of the greatest threats ever seen in our time.~|~translationMissing
Our job here is to decide upon a solution and then enact it.~|~translationMissing
The solution is clear. We need to take these dragons head on and destroy them.~|~translationMissing
King Arthur~|~translationMissing
Careful Lathas. I have seen the horrors of war first hand. This is not something we should merrily jump into.~|~translationMissing
And what would the great King Arthur have us do? Would you cower in fear while these dragons annihilate those around you?~|~translationMissing
Enough!~|~translationMissing
With our forces united, we should have the strength to take on these dragons and destroy them.~|~translationMissing
I take no joy in it, but war may be the only option here. If even half of what history says is true, the dragonkin are merciless.~|~translationMissing
Before this meeting, I thought I'd have a good old rummage around in our archives. I'm afraid the old bean is right. War is inevitable.~|~translationMissing
With all due respect, how can we be sure that this is the work of a dragonkin? I trust [player name] as much as anyone, but what if there was a mistake?~|~translationMissing
It's no mistake. I saw it myself.~|~translationMissing
They speak the truth.~|~translationMissing
Let me guess, you used your magic to work that one out?~|~translationMissing
Careful, Brundt, I am not the enemy here.~|~translationMissing
If we are agreed that the threat is real, may I suggest we get to work on solving it rather than bickering amongst ourselves.~|~translationMissing
As much as I hate to agree with a White Knight, he's right. We need to work together if we are going to survive.~|~translationMissing
The dragons are amassing at Ungael. We should take the fight to them and destroy the danger before it leaves that island!~|~translationMissing
That would keep the fight away from any innocents, but it would be a great risk.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Boats do not do well against dragonfire.~|~translationMissing
The citizens must take priority. If we have an opportunity to keep the danger away from them, we should take it.~|~translationMissing
Well said, fellow. Well said indeed.~|~translationMissing
King Lathas/Thoros~|~translationMissing
So we amass the fleets?~|~translationMissing
We do. Unless anyone has any complaints. [player name]? You've been very quiet throughout this. What are your thoughts?~|~translationMissing
It's a good plan.~|~translationMissing
It's a bad plan.~|~translationMissing
I fear we don't have a choice. The risks are great, but they were always going to be with a threat like this.~|~translationMissing
He's right. This is the only option.~|~translationMissing
Then we are agreed. This room contains some of the most powerful people in the world. Heroes and rulers alike. We may be the only thing that stands in the way of annihilation.~|~translationMissing
We may not all like each other, and some of us have a checkered history, but we will work together to destroy this enemy.~|~translationMissing
Good luck to us all.~|~translationMissing
You should join us for this fight, [Fremennik name]. Torfinn will take you to the fleet when you are ready.~|~translationMissing
Could I have a word with you outside, [player name]? There's something we need to discuss.~|~translationMissing
The player automatically exits the meeting.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. We need to talk about Zorgoth.~|~translationMissing
What about him?~|~translationMissing
He is the real threat here. You can kill as many dragons as you want in this battle, but it won't be over until Zorgoth himself is dealt with.~|~translationMissing
Do you have a plan?~|~translationMissing
Dragonkin are not easy to kill. In fact, they are immune to most weapons. But Zorgoth made it clear that Galvek is the key to his plan. The only reason he has this army is because of that dragon.~|~translationMissing
So Galvek must die?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Without Galvek, Zorgoth has nothing. Removing his army is the only chance of stopping him. It must be done, no matter the cost.~|~translationMissing
That won't be easy.~|~translationMissing
It won't, but I have faith in you, [player name]. Now you'd better head to the fleet. I'll see you in Rellekka.~|~translationMissing
You're coming with us?~|~translationMissing
I am. I can't fight any more, but I know a lot about the dragonkin. I might be able to use that knowledge to help. Besides, much of this is my fault, so it's only right that I help fix it. Now let's get going.~|~translationMissing
Our armies are preparing for the assault on Ungael. Speak to Torfinn in Rellekka when you are ready, he will take you to the fleet.~|~translationMissing
Good day to you, [Fremennik name]. Do you want to go to the fleet?~|~translationMissing
I'm not meant to be talking to you [Fremennik name]. I guess I can still take you to the fleet though if you want.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. The scene shows the various ships of the global allied fleet, then showing the ship that the player, Brundt, Koschei, and Thorvald are on.~|~translationMissing
Thorvald the Warrior~|~translationMissing
Alert!~|~translationMissing
The scene shows a green, red, and blue dragon launching dragonfire towards the ship, beginning the first part of the assault.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any of my items?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not [Fremennik name]. If I did have any of your items, but you died before collecting them, they'll now be lost.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. The scene shows the ship the player is on.~|~translationMissing
I can see the island! We're almost there!~|~translationMissing
Koschei the Deathless~|~translationMissing
Incoming!~|~translationMissing
The ship is bombarded with dragonfire, and the screen fades to black.~|~translationMissing
Time to wake up, [Fremennik name]. You have dragons to slay!~|~translationMissing
Eugh... what happened?~|~translationMissing
Dragons happened, that's what.~|~translationMissing
Where did everyone else go?~|~translationMissing
They went on ahead. You should catch up. I'll cover the rear.~|~translationMissing
[player name]! Thank goodness you're here. We've got ourselves into quite the situation.~|~translationMissing
What do we do? We're never going to make it to the island now.~|~translationMissing
We'll have to worry about that later. For now, you'll need to take out these dragons.~|~translationMissing
No time to talk, [player name]. Get out there and kill those dragons.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. The scene shows Galvek landing on the ship, instantly killing the four remaining soldiers. Bob walks forward and stops next to you, just as Zorgoth arrives.~|~translationMissing
Well look who it is. I see you're still alive.~|~translationMissing
I'm not easy to kill.~|~translationMissing
As for you, Robert...~|~translationMissing
You should have stayed at home. You're not a warrior anymore.~|~translationMissing
Maybe not, but I'm right where I need to be.~|~translationMissing
How touching.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Galvek!~|~translationMissing
Galvek launches dragonfire toward the player, but Bob jumps in the way and is instantly killed.~|~translationMissing
Bob!~|~translationMissing
See how the mighty fall.~|~translationMissing
You will pay for this!~|~translationMissing
We shall see...~|~translationMissing
A black dragon lands, and the cutscene ends.~|~translationMissing
After defeating the black, steel, and brutal red dragons, a cutscene begins. The scene shows a mithril dragon landing between the player and Zorgoth.~|~translationMissing
Why do you persist? Can't you see you've already lost?~|~translationMissing
Your precious hero is gone! Your friends have abandoned you!~|~translationMissing
A brief pause.~|~translationMissing
Wise Old Man~|~translationMissing
Don't be so sure.~|~translationMissing
The camera pans towards Achietties, Brundt, the Wise Old Man, Sir Tiffy, the Oneiromancer, and Jardric, who have come to your aid.~|~translationMissing
After killing the mithril, adamant, and rune dragons, a cutscene begins.~|~translationMissing
Enough of this! You've had your fun! But that fun is at an end!~|~translationMissing
You will now face the full might of my power!~|~translationMissing
The camera pans towards all the heroes, and a pair of brutal black dragons land behind them.~|~translationMissing
We've got your back, [player name]. Now you show that dragon what for!~|~translationMissing
Yes, come on, Dragon Slayer. Let's see what you've got.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins. Galvek dies, falling backwards. With their literal, last dying (dragon)breath, accidentally kills Zorgoth by coincidence.~|~translationMissing
Nooooooooooo!~|~translationMissing
That was for Bob!~|~translationMissing
The heroes walk towards the player.~|~translationMissing
A true warrior.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work!~|~translationMissing
Good show old bean!~|~translationMissing
Splendid!~|~translationMissing
Great work, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Achietties~|~translationMissing
You did it!~|~translationMissing
The scene changes to Burthorpe, where the player, Unferth, and Neite mourn the loss of Bob at his grave.~|~translationMissing
I hear we have a hero in our midst. You have faced one of the greatest threats this world has ever seen and come out victorious.~|~translationMissing
Not without losses though.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. We will ensure their sacrifice is never forgotten.~|~translationMissing
All that remains is to ensure that history will forever remember this day. Now, tell me everything.~|~translationMissing
You tell Alec about your quest and all that you discovered.~|~translationMissing
Thank you friend. You have helped us to fill our Library of Knowledge. The secrets that you have uncovered are worth more than any coin. It is an honour to welcome you into the Myths' Guild.~|~translationMissing

Quest transcriptDragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
This page was last modified on 22 April 2023, at 00~|~translationMissing
1 Starting the quest~|~translationMissing
1.1 Talking to Kaqemeex again~|~translationMissing
2 Talking to Sanfew~|~translationMissing
3 Gathering the ingredients~|~translationMissing
3.1 Dipping meats in the cauldron~|~translationMissing
Kaqemeex~|~translationMissing
What brings you to our holy monument?~|~translationMissing
We are the druids of Guthix. We worship our god at our famous stone circles. You will find them located throughout these lands.~|~translationMissing
What about the stone circle full of dark wizards?~|~translationMissing
That used to be OUR stone circle. Unfortunately, many many years ago, dark wizards cast a wicked spell upon it so that they could corrupt its power for their own evil ends.~|~translationMissing
When they cursed the rocks for their rituals they made them useless to us and our magics. We require a brave adventurer to go on a quest for us to help purify the circle of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Start the Druidic Ritual quest?~|~translationMissing
So what's so good about Guthix?~|~translationMissing
He exists in the trees, and the flowers, the water and the rocks. He is everywhere. His purpose is to ensure balance in everything in this world, and as such we worship him.~|~translationMissing
He sounds kind of boring...~|~translationMissing
Some day when your mind achieves enlightenment you will see the true beauty of his power.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll be on my way now.~|~translationMissing
Goodbye adventurer. I feel we shall meet again.~|~translationMissing
I'm in search of a quest.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I think I may have a worthwhile quest for you actually. I don't know if you are familiar with the stone circle south of Varrock or not, but...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I will try and help.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Go to the village south of this place and speak to my fellow druid, Sanfew, who is working on the purification ritual. He knows what is required to complete it.~|~translationMissing
No, that doesn't sound very interesting.~|~translationMissing
I will not try and change your mind adventurer. Some day when you have matured you may reconsider your position. We will wait until then.~|~translationMissing
Did you build this?~|~translationMissing
What, personally? No, of course I didn't. However, our forefathers did. The first Druids of Guthix built many stone circles across these lands over eight hundred years ago.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately we only know of two remaining, and of those only one is usable by us anymore.~|~translationMissing
I'm in search of a quest~|~translationMissing
Hello again, adventurer. You will need to speak to my fellow druid Sanfew in the village south of here to continue in your quest.~|~translationMissing
Sanfew~|~translationMissing
What can I do for you young 'un?~|~translationMissing
I've been sent to help purify the Varrock stone circle.~|~translationMissing
I've been sent to assist you with the ritual to purify the Varrockian stone circle.~|~translationMissing
Well, what I'm struggling with right now is the meats needed for the potion to honour Guthix. I need the raw meats of four different animals for it, but not just any old meats will do.~|~translationMissing
Each meat has to be dipped individually into the Cauldron of Thunder for it to work correctly.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find this cauldron?~|~translationMissing
It is located somewhere in the mysterious underground halls which are located somewhere in the woods just South of here. They are too dangerous for me to go myself however.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go do that then.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll do that then.~|~translationMissing
Well thank you very much!~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't need to speak to you.~|~translationMissing
Actually I don't need to speak to you.~|~translationMissing
Well, we all make mistakes sometimes.~|~translationMissing
Did you bring me the required ingredients for the potion?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have all four meats~|~translationMissing
No, not yet...~|~translationMissing
Well, let me know when you do young 'un.~|~translationMissing
What was I meant to be doing again?~|~translationMissing
Trouble with your memory eh young 'un? I need the raw meats of four different animals that have been dipped into the Cauldron of Thunder so I can make my potion to honour Guthix.~|~translationMissing
Ooooh yeah, I remember.~|~translationMissing
I'll get on with it.~|~translationMissing
Good, good.~|~translationMissing
If the player does have all four meats~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have all four now!~|~translationMissing
Well hand 'em over then [lad/lass]!~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much adventurer! These meats will allow our potion to honour Guthix to be completed, and bring one step closer to reclaiming our stone circle!~|~translationMissing
Now go and talk to Kaqemeex and he will introduce you to the wonderful world of herblore and potion making!~|~translationMissing
For raw chicken~|~translationMissing
You dip the raw chicken in the cauldron.~|~translationMissing
For raw beef~|~translationMissing
You dip the raw beef in the cauldron.~|~translationMissing
For raw rat meat~|~translationMissing
You dip the raw rat meat in the cauldron.~|~translationMissing
For raw bear meat~|~translationMissing
You dip the raw bear meat in the cauldron.~|~translationMissing
I have word from Sanfew that you have been very helpful in assisting him with his preparations for the purification ritual. As promised I will now teach you the ancient arts of Herblore.~|~translationMissing
Herblore is the skill of working with herbs and other ingredients, to make useful potions and poison.~|~translationMissing
First you will need a vial, which can be found or made with the crafting skill.~|~translationMissing
Then you must gather the herbs needed to make the potion you want.~|~translationMissing
You must fill your vial with water and add the ingredients you need. There are normally 2 ingredients to each type of potion.~|~translationMissing
Bear in mind, you must first clean each herb before you can use it.~|~translationMissing
You may also have to grind some ingredients before you can use them. You will need a pestle and mortar in order to do this.~|~translationMissing
Herbs can be found on the ground, and are also dropped by some monsters when you kill them.~|~translationMissing
Let's try an example Attack potion~|~translationMissing
Mix these in your water-filled vial, and you will produce an Attack potion. Drink this potion to increase your Attack level.~|~translationMissing
Different potions also require different Herblore levels before you can make them.~|~translationMissing

Captain Lawgof~|~translationMissing
Guthix be praised, the cavalry has arrived! Hero, how would you like to be made an honorary member of the Black Guard?~|~translationMissing
The Black Guard? What's that?~|~translationMissing
Hawhaw! 'What's that' [he/she] asks, what a sense of humour! The Black Guard is the finest regiment in the dwarven army. Only the best of the best are allowed to join it and then they receive months of rigorous training.~|~translationMissing
However, we are currently in need of a hero, so for a limited time only I'm offering you, a human, a chance to join this prestigious regiment. What do you say?~|~translationMissing
Start the Dwarf Cannon quest?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I'd be honoured to join.~|~translationMissing
That's the spirit! Now trooper, we have no time to waste - the goblins are attacking from the forests to the South. There are so many of them, they are overwhelming my men and breaking through our~|~translationMissing
Sure, sounds easy enough...~|~translationMissing
The Dwarf Captain gives you six railings.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a hammer~|~translationMissing
You'll need this hammer too.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a hammer.)~|~translationMissing
Report back to me once you've fixed the railings.~|~translationMissing
Yes Sir, Captain!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I'm too busy mining.~|~translationMissing
Well best make the most of it while you can, if the goblins over-run us they'll descend on the mines like a plague of locusts!~|~translationMissing
The Black Guard sent Lawgof this cannon to help defend the mines against the goblins.~|~translationMissing
This railing is broken and needs to be replaced.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a railing~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to be able to fix this without a new railing. Lawgof should have some spare ones.~|~translationMissing
You attempt to repalce the broken railing...~|~translationMissing
You will need a hammer to fix the railings.~|~translationMissing
If the player fails to repair the railing~|~translationMissing
Your arm is getting tired.~|~translationMissing
You cut yourself on the rusty old railing.~|~translationMissing
You accidentally crush your hand in the railing.~|~translationMissing
You wrench your back trying to handle the railings.~|~translationMissing
(The player is dealt 0-2 damage.)~|~translationMissing
Oooch!~|~translationMissing
Ow!~|~translationMissing
Urrrgh!~|~translationMissing
Gah!~|~translationMissing
If the player successfully repairs the railing~|~translationMissing
This railing is now fixed.~|~translationMissing
If all the railing are fixed~|~translationMissing
I've fixed all these railings now.~|~translationMissing
That's better, the goblins won't get past this piece of fencing now.~|~translationMissing
Hello, trooper, how are you doing with those railings?~|~translationMissing
I'm getting there.~|~translationMissing
The goblins are still getting in, so there must still be some broken railings.~|~translationMissing
If the player has no railings~|~translationMissing
But I'm out of railings...~|~translationMissing
That's okay, we've got plenty, here you go.~|~translationMissing
There's no room in your backpack, so I can't give you anymore.~|~translationMissing
The Dwarf Captain gives you another railing.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 1 railing~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll find them soon enough.~|~translationMissing
Well done, trooper! The goblins seems to have stopped getting in. I think you've done the job!~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll be getting on then.~|~translationMissing
What? I'll have you jailed for desertion!~|~translationMissing
Besides, I have another commission for you. Just before the goblins over-ran us we lost contact with our watch tower to the South, that's why the goblins managed to catch us unawares. I'd like you to perform~|~translationMissing
a covert operation into enemy territory, to check up on the guards we have stationed there.~|~translationMissing
They should have reported in by now ...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll see what I can find out.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! I have two men there, the dwarf-in-charge is called Gilob, find him and tell him that I'll send him a relief guard just as soon as we mop up these remaining goblins.~|~translationMissing
Hello[sic]~|~translationMissing
Hello, any news from the watchman?~|~translationMissing
Well, as quick as you can then.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the remains~|~translationMissing
What? Carrying one set of Dwarf remains is enough...~|~translationMissing
I had better take these remains.~|~translationMissing
Have you been to the watch tower yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I went up but there was no one there.~|~translationMissing
That's strange, Gilob would never leave his post... His son was also with him, something doesn't smell right. Can you return and look for clues?~|~translationMissing
Of course, I'll do what I can.~|~translationMissing
I have some terrible news for you Captain, the goblins over ran the tower, your guards fought well but were overwhelmed.~|~translationMissing
You give the Dwarf Captain his subordinate's remains...~|~translationMissing
I can't believe it, Gilob was the finest lieutenant I had! We'll give him a fitting funeral, but what of his command? His son, Lollk, was with him. Did you find his body too?~|~translationMissing
No, there was only one body there, I searched pretty well.~|~translationMissing
The goblins must have taken him. Please traveler, seek out the goblins' hideout and return the lad to us. They always attack from the South-east, so they must be based down there.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll see if I can find their hideout.~|~translationMissing
You search the crate...~|~translationMissing
You search the crate but find nothing.~|~translationMissing
You search the crate..~|~translationMissing
Inside you see a dwarf child, tied up!~|~translationMissing
You untie the child.~|~translationMissing
Lollk~|~translationMissing
Thank the heavens, you saved me! I thought I'd be goblin lunch for sure!~|~translationMissing
I think so, I'd better run off home.~|~translationMissing
That's right, you get going, I'll catch up.~|~translationMissing
Thanks again, brave adventurer.~|~translationMissing
The dwarf child runs off into the caverns.~|~translationMissing
Hello, has Lollk returned yet?~|~translationMissing
He has, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart - without you he'd be a goblin barbecue!~|~translationMissing
Always a pleasure to help.~|~translationMissing
In that case could I ask one more favour of you...~|~translationMissing
When the goblins attacked us some of them managed to slip past my guards and sabotage our cannon. I don't have anybody who understands how it works, could you have a look at it and see if you could get it working for~|~translationMissing
us, please?~|~translationMissing
Thank you, take this toolkit, you'll need it...~|~translationMissing
You don't have room to take this, report back to me when you do.~|~translationMissing
The Dwarf Captain gives you a tool kit.[sic]~|~translationMissing
Report back to me if you manage to fix it.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I've done enough for today.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, didn't think you'd be able to help anyway, not much chance for a human to be able to fix it when the best dwarven engineers have failed.~|~translationMissing
I guess I'd better fix it with the toolkit I was given.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing in there, trooper? We've been trying our best with that thing, but I just haven't got the patience.~|~translationMissing
It's not an easy job, but I'm getting there.~|~translationMissing
Good stuff, let me know if you have any luck. If we manage to get that thing working, those goblins will be no trouble at all.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the toolkit~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I lost the toolkit...~|~translationMissing
That was silly... never mind, I can give you another, but you'll have to free up some space in your backpack first.~|~translationMissing
That was silly... never mind, here you go.~|~translationMissing
The Dwarf Captain gives you another toolkit.~|~translationMissing
Well done! You've fixed the cannon! Better go and tell Captain Lawgof.~|~translationMissing
This should work nicely now that I've fixed it.~|~translationMissing
What do you think you're doing, trooper! Did I give you orders to move that cannon? No! Well then don't!~|~translationMissing
Hello there trooper, how's things?~|~translationMissing
Well, I think I've done it, take a look...~|~translationMissing
That's fantastic, well done!~|~translationMissing
Well I don't believe it, it seems to be working perfectly! I seem to have underestimated you, trooper!~|~translationMissing
Not bad for an adventurer eh?~|~translationMissing
You give the toolkit back to Captain Lawgof.~|~translationMissing
Not bad at all, your effort is appreciated, my friend. Now, if I could figure what the thing uses as ammo...~|~translationMissing
The Black Guard forgot to send instructions. I know I said that was the last favour, but...~|~translationMissing
What now?~|~translationMissing
I can't leave this post, could you go to the Black Guard base and find out what this thing actually shoots?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I've really done enough.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, fair enough.~|~translationMissing
Okay then, just for you!~|~translationMissing
That's great, we were lucky you came along when you did. The base is located just South of the Ice Mountain.~|~translationMissing
You'll need to speak to Nulodion, the Dwarf Cannon engineer. He's the Weapons Development Chief for the Black Guard, so if anyone knows how to fire this thing, it'll be him.~|~translationMissing
Hi again.~|~translationMissing
Hello trooper, any word from the Cannon Engineer?~|~translationMissing
The Black Guard camp is South of the Ice Mountain, the quicker we can get some ammo for this thing the quicker those Goblins will leave us be.~|~translationMissing
I'll get to it.~|~translationMissing
Nulodion~|~translationMissing
Captain Lawgof sent me. He's having trouble with his cannon.~|~translationMissing
Of course, we forgot to send the ammo mould!~|~translationMissing
It fires mould?~|~translationMissing
Don't be silly - the ammo's made by using a mould. Here, take these to him. The instructions explain everything.~|~translationMissing
You can't take these things unless you free up some space in your inventory. I suggest you visit a bank and then come back to talk to me.~|~translationMissing
The Cannon Engineer gives you some notes and a mould.~|~translationMissing
That's great, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, adventurer. The Dwarf Black Guard will remember this.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the notes~|~translationMissing
I've lost the notes.~|~translationMissing
Here, take these...~|~translationMissing
The Cannon Engineer gives you some more notes.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the ammo mould~|~translationMissing
I've lost the cannonball mould.~|~translationMissing
Deary me, you are trouble. Here, take this one.~|~translationMissing
The Cannon Engineer gives you another mould.~|~translationMissing
So has the Captain figured out how to work the cannon yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but I'm sure he will.~|~translationMissing
If you can get those items to him it'll be a great help.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have spoken to him.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the notes and ammo mould~|~translationMissing
He gave me some items to give you... but I seem to have lost something.~|~translationMissing
If you could go back and get another, I'd appreciate it.~|~translationMissing
Oh, okay then.~|~translationMissing
He gave me an ammo mould and some notes to give to you...~|~translationMissing
Aah, of course, we make the ammo! This is great, now we will be able to defend ourselves. I don't know how to thank you...~|~translationMissing
You could give me a cannon...~|~translationMissing
Hah! You'd be lucky, those things are worth a fortune.~|~translationMissing
I'll tell you what though, I'll write to the Cannon Engineer requesting him to sell you one. He controls production of the cannons.~|~translationMissing
He won't be able to give you one, but for the right price, I'm sure he'll sell one to you.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... sounds interesting, I might take you up on that.~|~translationMissing

Have you any more work for me, to help reclaim the circle?~|~translationMissing
Ah, you've come just in time. I need a certain herb for the next part of the purification ritual...~|~translationMissing
It used to be quite common, but nowadays only the trolls know where to find it. They use it in their cooking, you see. It's a very prized ingredient.~|~translationMissing
And what exactly do you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
Journey to the north into the land of the trolls, and find the secret of the herb the trolls call 'goutweed'.~|~translationMissing
My friend Eadgar lives in the area, and he may be able to help you. Bring some goutweed back and I will teach you something useful.~|~translationMissing
Start the Eadgar's Ruse quest?~|~translationMissing
I'll do it.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Oh well. No doubt some other adventurer will eventually come who can help me.~|~translationMissing
I've told you already.~|~translationMissing
Journey to the north into the land of the trolls, and find the secret of the herb the trolls call goutweed.~|~translationMissing
You search the laundry basket... It's full of dirty robes.~|~translationMissing
So, you're doing laundry, eh?~|~translationMissing
Tegid~|~translationMissing
Yes. What is it to you?~|~translationMissing
Nice day for it.~|~translationMissing
I suppose it is.~|~translationMissing
You look under the rack but find nothing.~|~translationMissing
Er, hi.~|~translationMissing
Burntmeat~|~translationMissing
Hmm? What human do in troll kitchen? Burntmeat tired of cooking goats. Human look tasty.~|~translationMissing
Oh, you don't want to eat me! I'm a tough, hardened adventurer, not tender or tasty at all!~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Burntmeat think you probably right. What human doing here?~|~translationMissing
I'm on a quest to find some goutweed.~|~translationMissing
Bwahahaha! Burntmeat not give his greatest cooking secret away so easily.~|~translationMissing
But Burntmeat also has quest for human!~|~translationMissing
Really? What is it?~|~translationMissing
Bring back a tasty human for Burntmeat's stew. If you find tasty human, Burntmeat will give you good reward.~|~translationMissing
Right. I'll just...go fetch that for you then. Bye!~|~translationMissing
Did you find tasty human?~|~translationMissing
Erm, not yet, but I'm working on it...~|~translationMissing
I need to find some goutweed. Sanfew said you might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Eadgar~|~translationMissing
Sanfew, you say? Ah, haven't seen him in a while...~|~translationMissing
I talked to the troll cook but he wouldn't tell me anything, and now he wants me to find him some tasty human for his stew.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, that's no good. You can't just go hand over a human to those trolls...~|~translationMissing
Aha! I have a plan!~|~translationMissing
Yes! It's bound to work. First of all, I will need a parrot!~|~translationMissing
A PARROT? Where am I going to find one of those?~|~translationMissing
At the zoo, where else?~|~translationMissing
Anything else I can do for you?~|~translationMissing
Why do you live so close to the trolls?~|~translationMissing
Why do you live so close to the trolls? Isn't it dangerous?~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose I do keep getting captured by the trolls and thrown in prison...But they always release me in the end, I'm far too old and skinny for their tastes.~|~translationMissing
In any case, this is my home, and I'm not leaving it. And this area has the tastiest goats!~|~translationMissing
What do you have to offer?~|~translationMissing
The chef's recommendation for today is mountain goat stew. I'll give some stew in exchange for logs for my fire. They're hard to come by around here.~|~translationMissing
I'd like some mountain goat stew, please.~|~translationMissing
Here you go! Enjoy!~|~translationMissing
No thanks, Eadgar.~|~translationMissing
Your loss!~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you. Have you got me a parrot yet?~|~translationMissing
I haven't been able to find one yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, go see if the zoo have one.~|~translationMissing
Where's the zoo?~|~translationMissing
It's in Ardougne, south west of here.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be right back.~|~translationMissing
Parroty Pete~|~translationMissing
Good day, good day. Come to admire the new parrot aviary have we?~|~translationMissing
It's very nice.~|~translationMissing
Isn't it just?~|~translationMissing
When did you add it?~|~translationMissing
Just recently. It would have been sooner, but some wretch thought it would be amusing to replace their drinking water with vodka. The vet had to nurse them back to health for weeks!~|~translationMissing
What do you feed them?~|~translationMissing
Well, fruit and grain mostly. I try to give them a balanced diet, but their favourite treat is pineapple chunks.~|~translationMissing
They won't drink it straight from the bottle...~|~translationMissing
You manage to attract a parrot, but it flies away when you try to catch it.~|~translationMissing
I need some way to slow it down...~|~translationMissing
You manage to attract a parrot and catch it.~|~translationMissing
Hah! Got you now!~|~translationMissing
Parrot~|~translationMissing
Sqwaawk...*hic*~|~translationMissing
Hey! What are you doing with that parrot?~|~translationMissing
It looks drunk! You should NEVER feed alcohol to a parrot!~|~translationMissing
Well, good thing I found it! I'll just take it to the vet for you, shall I?~|~translationMissing
Oh, thank you! We're ever so busy here at the Zoo.~|~translationMissing
Raaawk! Polly wanna cracker!~|~translationMissing
Here it is! Now are you going to explain your plan?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, of course. It's quite ingenious really!~|~translationMissing
What we need is something that looks like a human, sounds like a human, smells like a human and tastes like a human.~|~translationMissing
How are we going to make it look like a human?~|~translationMissing
We'll just make a scarecrow. We'll need logs, and 10 sheaves of wheat for stuffing.~|~translationMissing
How are we going to make it sound like a human?~|~translationMissing
That's what the parrot's for, of course.~|~translationMissing
Who's a pretty boy then?~|~translationMissing
Although the trolls might get suspicious if it doesn't say what they expect a human to say...~|~translationMissing
You should hide it for a while somewhere it can pick up some more appropriate catchphrases.~|~translationMissing
How are we going to make it smell like a human?~|~translationMissing
I'm a man of few clothes myself, so you might want to ask old Sanfew about that one.~|~translationMissing
And how are we going to make it taste like a human?~|~translationMissing
That's easy, we'll just stuff it with a few chickens. Everything tastes like chicken! Five raw chickens should be enough.~|~translationMissing
That's the plan. Anything else I can do for you?~|~translationMissing
What should I do with this parrot?~|~translationMissing
I told you, put it somewhere it'll learn to say the sort of thing the trolls will expect it to say.~|~translationMissing
This is likely to be screaming. There's bound to be a good spot somewhere in the troll prison.~|~translationMissing
How are we going to make it taste like a human?~|~translationMissing
More~|~translationMissing
You hide the parrot under the torture rack.~|~translationMissing
You look under the rack and find the drunk parrot.~|~translationMissing
Polly wanna cracker!~|~translationMissing
Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!~|~translationMissing
I don't think it's done yet.~|~translationMissing
I hid the parrot under the rack in the troll prison.~|~translationMissing
Good work. How about those other items?~|~translationMissing
I have [no/the] logs, [no/one/two/three/four/five] [chicken/chickens], [no/one/two/three/four/five/six/seven/eight/nine/ten] [bundle/bundles] of grain and [no/the] dirty clothes.~|~translationMissing
You now need [no/the] logs, [no/one/two/three/four/five] [chicken/chickens], [no/one/two/three/four/five/six/seven/eight/nine/ten] [bundle/bundles] of grain and [no/the] dirty clothes.~|~translationMissing
Eadgar says he needs some dirty clothes for his plan, and he said you might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Now why would he need that?~|~translationMissing
It's a long story.~|~translationMissing
Never mind then... I think Tegid is doing his laundry outside. You could ask him if you can borrow one of his dirty robes.~|~translationMissing
You wouldn't be able to spare any of those dirty robes by any chance? It's a matter of the utmost importance.~|~translationMissing
What? No! These are my robes!~|~translationMissing
Fine.~|~translationMissing
Sanfew won't be happy...~|~translationMissing
I'm sure Sanfew won't be happy when I tell him it's your fault he can't perform the purification ritual.~|~translationMissing
What? Oh well, if it's a matter of that much importance, I suppose you can borrow one...~|~translationMissing
You'll give me those robes right now...~|~translationMissing
You'll give me those robes right now...or I'm going to cut down trees until you do.~|~translationMissing
Of course I would. They're just trees.~|~translationMissing
You monster! Take the robes and leave this place!~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet given all the supplies~|~translationMissing
That's everything!~|~translationMissing
Good, good, everything is almost finished.~|~translationMissing
Of course, we can't just give him the dummy and expect to get anything useful out of him.~|~translationMissing
Oh?~|~translationMissing
No, of course not. We need to make sure he'll tell you what you need to know.~|~translationMissing
And how do we do that?~|~translationMissing
I happen to know that the trolls are susceptible to a certain kind of plant that grows around this mountain. I call it Troll Thistle. If properly prepared, it can be made into a sort of Troll truth potion.~|~translationMissing
How do you prepare it?~|~translationMissing
You'll have to dry it in a fire, then grind it and mix it into a potion with Ranarr weed.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back with that soon.~|~translationMissing
How do I make the troll truth potion again?~|~translationMissing
Troll Thistle grows around this mountain. If properly prepared, it can be made into a sort of Troll truth potion.~|~translationMissing
I need to dry it over a fire first.~|~translationMissing
You dry the troll thistle over the fire.~|~translationMissing
I'd better not mess around with Eadgar's stew!~|~translationMissing
You decide to leave Eadgar's stew alone.~|~translationMissing
It's too big to fit in the vial.~|~translationMissing
You grind the Troll Thistle.~|~translationMissing
You add the ground Troll Thistle to the potion.~|~translationMissing
I've got the troll truth potion.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, thank you. Now just go fetch that poor parrot back, it's probably had enough by now.~|~translationMissing
Ah, hello Sir. Could you please free me? I seem to have ... OW! What are you doing? That's my spleen!~|~translationMissing
I think it's probably heard enough.~|~translationMissing
The parrott[sic] flew off, I wonder where it went? Silly thing prefered Eadgar to me!~|~translationMissing
The parrott[sic] flew off, you need to find it again.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the parrot~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you. You didn't lose your parrot did you? One flew over here and I managed to capture it.~|~translationMissing
That's what I thought.~|~translationMissing
Just give me a moment...there we go! Can you tell this isn't a bona fide human being? I sure can't!~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the parrot~|~translationMissing
I've brought the parrot.~|~translationMissing
Hand it here...there we go! Can you tell this isn't a bona fide human being? I sure can't!~|~translationMissing
Fake man~|~translationMissing
What am I doing here? Ow! Where's the rest of the Guard? Agh! I won't tell you anything!~|~translationMissing
Have you given the fake man to the troll cook yet?~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the fake man~|~translationMissing
Go on then, give it to the cook!~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the fake man~|~translationMissing
No. I lost it.~|~translationMissing
You bumbling imbecile!~|~translationMissing
Never mind, here's one I prepared earlier.~|~translationMissing
Did you find tasty human? Burntmeat smell something good.~|~translationMissing
Yes! Look!~|~translationMissing
Heeeeeeelp!~|~translationMissing
Ah, dat look like nice tasty human.~|~translationMissing
Aaaargh! Somebody save me!~|~translationMissing
Yep, sound like human too. Burntmeat put it in stew. Good work, human. Burntmeat give precious reward.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Burnt meat.)~|~translationMissing
This is burnt meat.~|~translationMissing
It first thing I ever try to cook! Very precious to Burntmeat.~|~translationMissing
Thank you... and how's the stew?~|~translationMissing
Slurp, mmm... Human stew cheer Burntmeat up!~|~translationMissing
So, where can I get some goutweed?~|~translationMissing
Hah! Trolls pick it all until none left, many years ago. Only remaining stock in storeroom.~|~translationMissing
It well guarded, and Burntmeat hide key in fake bottom of kitchen drawer. Nobody find it there.~|~translationMissing
That's some well-guarded secret alright. I'll just be off on my way now.~|~translationMissing
I'll be going now.~|~translationMissing
Bye, bye.~|~translationMissing
How's the stew?~|~translationMissing
You search the drawers...~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the key~|~translationMissing
You dont find anything.~|~translationMissing
You open the fake bottom of the drawer and see a key, but don't have space to take it.~|~translationMissing
You open the fake bottom of the drawer and find the storeroom key.~|~translationMissing
You unlock the door.~|~translationMissing
!~|~translationMissing
You've found some goutweed!~|~translationMissing
Hm?~|~translationMissing
Well? Did the plan work?~|~translationMissing
Yes! I can get into the storeroom now.~|~translationMissing
Glad to hear it!~|~translationMissing
I have some goutweed!~|~translationMissing
Excellent! I will be able to complete the next part of the ritual now. I will teach you a new spell and give you some of my knowledge in Herblore as a token of thanks.~|~translationMissing
Welcome to Mad Eadgar's! Serving all day, every day!~|~translationMissing
Would you care to sample our delicious home cooking?~|~translationMissing
I have some more goutweed for you.~|~translationMissing
Ah, good. Here are some herbs in exchange.~|~translationMissing
Have you any more work for me to help reclaim the stone circle?~|~translationMissing
Well, not right now I don't think young 'un. In fact, I need to make some more preparations myself for the ritual. Rest assured, if I need any more help I will ask you again.~|~translationMissing

Charlie~|~translationMissing
Ah, you sound like someone who needs a quest doing!~|~translationMissing
If the player is below level 27 in Hunter~|~translationMissing
Well... maybe. How much do you know about hunting?~|~translationMissing
Well I know a little bit...~|~translationMissing
No, I could do with some help, but I'm afraid I need somebody with a little more experience.~|~translationMissing
If the player is level 27 or above in Hunter~|~translationMissing
Actually, now that you come to mention it, you might be able to help me.~|~translationMissing
A few weeks ago we had a delivery of a northern ferret. They're funny little creatures. Turns out they're tricksy little blighters too.~|~translationMissing
Whilst we were unloading him from the cart he managed to escape his cage. What's more he gave the driver a nasty nip on the way out too.~|~translationMissing
This was obviously a bit of a blow, you can't make a new attraction without any animals.~|~translationMissing
We got in contact with one of our associates, a huntsman called Nickolaus, who agreed to capture us another.~|~translationMissing
Funny thing is we haven't heard from him for some time now. I don't suppose you'd mind having a look for him?~|~translationMissing
Sure.  Any idea where I should start looking?~|~translationMissing
Sure. Any idea where I should start looking?~|~translationMissing
Well the northern ferret is mostly found around the mountains just west of the Gnome Stronghold, so that would probably be as good a place as any to start looking.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't have the time.~|~translationMissing
Oh well, I'm sure he'll be okay out there on his own.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Where did you get the animals from?~|~translationMissing
As you open the book something falls out from between the pages. It appears to be a small metal feather.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Metal feather.)~|~translationMissing
This area of rock doesn't quite seem to match the rest of the cliff face. There appears to be a thin vertical slot in the middle of the rock, with what appears to be a carving of a feather above it.~|~translationMissing
You place the metal feather into the groove in the cliff face. It seems to catch in some sort of mechanism.~|~translationMissing
Part of the cliff face swings outwards to reveal a tunnel heading into the mountain.~|~translationMissing
Nickolaus~|~translationMissing
Hello? Er... excuse me?~|~translationMissing
Hello?  Er... excuse me?~|~translationMissing
Hello, are you Nickolaus?~|~translationMissing
Aha, I see my reputation precedes me. Yes, I am the renowned hunter and explorer Nickolaus. You've arrived just in time to witness a very momentous occasion, for I have just discovered the nest of a giant~|~translationMissing
eagle.  And a most amazing discovery it is too, even if I do say so myself.~|~translationMissing
The Ardougne zookeeper sent me to find you.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, he sent me to find a ferret. A trivial task, and one which pales in comparison compared to this momentous discovery. I'm sure he can wait.~|~translationMissing
Well if you gave me a ferret I could take it back for you.~|~translationMissing
So it's not that you're trapped then?~|~translationMissing
Well I think trapped is quite a negative way of looking at it.~|~translationMissing
I will admit however that getting out of here may be a little tricky. I did have a plan, but unfortunately it didn't involve being stuck in this nest.~|~translationMissing
Could I help at all?~|~translationMissing
Actually I believe you could. I need to somehow trick the eagles into thinking I'm one of them. Could you fashion some sort of disguise for me?~|~translationMissing
What would that involve?~|~translationMissing
Well, you could go and speak to the fancy dress shop owner in Varrock.  He can make anything if you give him the right materials. In fact you should probably get a couple of disguises, one for each of us.~|~translationMissing
That's a good idea. There are plenty of feathers around here. I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Well it'll give you a lot of time to study the eagles~|~translationMissing
Well it'll give you a lot of time to study the eagles.~|~translationMissing
Very true, and certainly an opportunity I wouldn't want to miss.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll let you get on with your work then.~|~translationMissing
It's always a pleasure to discuss my discoveries.~|~translationMissing
Oh, but I'd come to rescue you.~|~translationMissing
I've come to rescue you.~|~translationMissing
How very kind of you. But Nickolaus Farrick never needs rescuing.  I may apparently be trapped in a giant eagle's nest, but it is all a cunning ruse to put the beast at ease.~|~translationMissing
Aren't giant eagles mythical?~|~translationMissing
Oh, so you're not really trapped?~|~translationMissing
Oh many people believe so, yes, but my relentless exploration has paid off once again, for I stand now in the nest of such a supposedly mythical creature.~|~translationMissing
How did you manage to find the nest?~|~translationMissing
Through unfaltering dedication, attention to detail, oh, and I suppose there's the minor point that I got carried here by an eagle.~|~translationMissing
So in fact the eagle found you?~|~translationMissing
So it might appear to an amateur yes, and, well, I may have been a little lucky, but it's still a remarkable discovery don't you think?~|~translationMissing
Amazing, but what do you intend to do now you've discovered it?~|~translationMissing
Well, there's all sorts to do. I need to observe its behaviour patterns and document its feeding habits.  The discovery is only just the beginning you know.~|~translationMissing
I think you're trapped.~|~translationMissing
Hello Nickolaus, how are you getting on with your discoveries?~|~translationMissing
Wonderfully, these giant eagles are simply magnificent creatures.  I absolutely must see about getting one as a pet.~|~translationMissing
A pet?  Are you crazy?~|~translationMissing
Quite possibly, quite possibly, but I haven't found a creature I couldn't tame yet.~|~translationMissing
Wonderfully thank you, although I am still having just a little trouble convincing them to let me leave.~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you've managed to get that disguise I asked for yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not yet.~|~translationMissing
Well like I said, the Varrock fancy dress shop is a good bet if you have the materials, and there are plenty of feathers around here.~|~translationMissing
And while you're working on that, I'll get back to studying these incredible winged wonders.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Okay, lets see what you've got then.~|~translationMissing
Well, specifically I'm after a couple of bird costumes.~|~translationMissing
Ah, an inspired choice. What kind of bird were you thinking of?~|~translationMissing
A giant eagle.~|~translationMissing
Very interesting. Unfortunately I don't think I have any giant eagle costumes in stock at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Of course if I had the materials I could make them for you.~|~translationMissing
What materials would you need?~|~translationMissing
Well, the main problem is that I'm fresh out of giant eagle feathers. I've been meaning to get onto my supplier about that for some time.~|~translationMissing
Wait a second, you have a supplier? But I thought nobody knew where to find the nests?~|~translationMissing
Well, there was some chap in desert clothing. He said his name was Ali. He assured me they were giant eagle feathers, although when I come to think about it they were suspiciously similar to chicken feathers.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you're probably looking at about 10 giant eagle feathers, assuming you can find a nest.~|~translationMissing
I'd also need some swamp tar to hold things together and some yellow dye for the beaks.  Everything else I can supply myself.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I think I might just leave the perusing for now thanks.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you make clothing suitable for hunting in?~|~translationMissing
What was it you needed to make those eagle costumes again?~|~translationMissing
I should be able to knock something up if you get me 10 of the right sort of feather. I'll also need some swamp tar and some yellow dye.~|~translationMissing
I've got the feathers and materials you requested.~|~translationMissing
I've got the feathers and materials you requested. Can you make those giant eagle costumes for me now?~|~translationMissing
Certainly. It'll also cost you 50 gold pieces.~|~translationMissing
Okay, here are the materials. Eagle me up.~|~translationMissing
Okay, here are the materials.  Eagle me up.~|~translationMissing
On second thoughts, that's too expensive.~|~translationMissing
Well, feel free to come back if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have one right here.~|~translationMissing
Well bring it over here then.  It's not much use to me over there.~|~translationMissing
After carefully examining the rocks, you manage to pick up the mysterious trail again. The tracks aren't entirely unfamiliar, but they do seem somewhat larger than any you have seen before.~|~translationMissing
Er...~|~translationMissing
A giant Kebbit jumps out of the cave.~|~translationMissing
Hey, give me that!~|~translationMissing
The kebbit stares at you.~|~translationMissing
Taunt the kebbit.~|~translationMissing
Give me that or... Er...~|~translationMissing
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!~|~translationMissing
The Kebbit goes into the opening while dropping the Silver feather.~|~translationMissing
Try something else.~|~translationMissing
The door seems to be locked in place. There is an engraving of an eagle on the door. Three of the feathers illustrated in the engraving seem to be cut deeper than the others. It looks like they may once have contained some sort of decoration.~|~translationMissing
You insert the metallic feather into one of the feather-shaped indentations in the engravings.~|~translationMissing
What's this, a young hatchling?  Oh no, I hope it doesn't think I'm its dinner!~|~translationMissing
No, Nickolaus, it's me!  I'm just in disguise!~|~translationMissing
You're sure...you're sure you're not going to eat me?~|~translationMissing
No of course not. You sent me to get you an eagle outfit remember?  So you could get out of this nest?~|~translationMissing
Wow, that really is a very convincing disguise.  Have you got one for me too?~|~translationMissing
You give Nickolaus a fake beak and an eagle feather cape.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, now there is no way the eagle will be able to tell me from one of its own.~|~translationMissing
Now you run off, and I'll meet you back down at the camp site.~|~translationMissing
I've given you the disguise you needed, can we go now?~|~translationMissing
Calm down.  You must realise I can't leave just like that, this is far too amazing an opportunity.  Just go down to the camp site and I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Nickolaus.~|~translationMissing
Ah, hello again.  Can I help at all?~|~translationMissing
Well I was originally sent to find you because of a ferret.~|~translationMissing
Well I was originally sent to find you because of a ferret.  Can you get me one at all?~|~translationMissing
I'll do better than that.  I'll teach you how to capture one yourself.~|~translationMissing
That sounds good to me.~|~translationMissing
That sounds good to me.  What do I do.~|~translationMissing
Come with me and I'll show you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, so we've baited the trap with meat, now what?~|~translationMissing
And now...we wait. Quietly!~|~translationMissing
But what if I don't like waiting for things?~|~translationMissing
Did I mention we wait quietly?~|~translationMissing
Shhh, here comes something.~|~translationMissing
A ferret goes into the box trap.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha, there you go! One gift-wrapped ferret ready for delivery.~|~translationMissing
See, it's all just a matter of patience.~|~translationMissing
Great, thanks!~|~translationMissing
I've not got the time right now.~|~translationMissing
Ah you don't get out of it that easily. When you've got the time come back and see me.~|~translationMissing
I was just wondering how you got on with those eagles.~|~translationMissing
Ah wonderfully.  They're actually most cooperative creatures once they get used to you.  With some rope I'm sure you could find some way to tame them... maybe even fly on them.~|~translationMissing
No thanks.  I was just dropping by.~|~translationMissing
No thanks.  I was just dropping by, wanted to make sure you hadn't been abducted again.~|~translationMissing
No such luck I'm afraid, but I'm sure I'll make another discovery soon enough.  I always seem to.~|~translationMissing
Ah, hello again. Have you had any luck finding a clue as to Nickolaus' whereabouts yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes I have actually. He'd been abducted by giant eagles, but I managed to rescue him. He's now gotten back to his hunting.~|~translationMissing
Giant eagles? What a strange notion. Well, regardless, if you've found him can you tell him to hurry up with that ferret.~|~translationMissing
Even better, I have a ferret right here for you.~|~translationMissing
You do? Ah, yes, wonderful, I never doubted you for a second. That'll make an excellent addition to the zoo.~|~translationMissing

Lazim~|~translationMissing
Ah, an adventurer. Could you spare some of your time to help me?~|~translationMissing
Why, what's the matter?~|~translationMissing
It's a sorry tale. I was once an accomplished sculptor, you see.~|~translationMissing
I made statues for the kings, queens and rulers of Gielinor. But then there was the accident...~|~translationMissing
After that, I could never hold a chisel again.~|~translationMissing
But I have been struck by my muse while travelling the desert, and want nothing more than to build a statue in this area.~|~translationMissing
The desert's plain and full of sand, and needs more decoration.~|~translationMissing
So, what would you need my help with?~|~translationMissing
As I said, I can't hold a chisel, but I can guide you in crafting the statue for me.~|~translationMissing
I'd need you to quarry the stone for it, as well.~|~translationMissing
Well, will you help me with my art?~|~translationMissing
You'll have to explain it to me as you go along, but count me in.~|~translationMissing
Excellent.~|~translationMissing
What should I be doing to make your statue?~|~translationMissing
Each of these blocks should be around... well, let's say thirty two kilograms for the first one.~|~translationMissing
I can't mine a block that big!~|~translationMissing
Well, then, bring me enough smaller blocks to make thirty two kilograms, and I will deal with it.~|~translationMissing
So, how much do different blocks of sandstone weigh?~|~translationMissing
From what the last adventurer told me, there are tiny blocks that weigh 1 kg, small blocks that weigh 2 kg, and medium-sized blocks that weigh 5 kg.~|~translationMissing
There are also large blocks that weigh 10 kg, but I doubt a weedy adventurer like you could even carry one, let alone mine one cleanly.~|~translationMissing
Apparently, the more skilled you are at mining, the larger the blocks you can chip off the rock.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll get on with it.~|~translationMissing
I don't know, that sounds like a lot of work.~|~translationMissing
All true art requires work.~|~translationMissing
I have some sandstone for you!~|~translationMissing
If the player has not given any sandstone yet~|~translationMissing
Well, hand it over, then.~|~translationMissing
If the player has already given some sandstone~|~translationMissing
That makes [1-32] kg I'm carrying now.~|~translationMissing
I'm now carrying [1-32] kg of your inexpertly-quarried stone.~|~translationMissing
That's [1-32] kg I have now.~|~translationMissing
I need [1-32] kg more stone to make the base. Any more stone you want to burden me down with?~|~translationMissing
I need [1-32] kg more stone to make the base. Have you any more to make me carry?~|~translationMissing
I need [1-32] kg more stone to make the base. Do you have any more stone you want to offload onto me?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have more stone.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has sandstone (10kg)~|~translationMissing
) Here's a large 10 kg block.~|~translationMissing
Here's a large 10 kg block.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has sandstone (5kg)~|~translationMissing
) Here's a medium 5 kg block.~|~translationMissing
Here's a medium 5 kg block.~|~translationMissing
Oh, joy. I'm sure I'll treasure it.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has sandstone (2kg)~|~translationMissing
) Here's a small 2 kg block.~|~translationMissing
Here's a small 2 kg block.~|~translationMissing
So generous of you, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has sandstone (1kg)~|~translationMissing
) Here's a tiny 1 kg block.~|~translationMissing
Here's a tiny 1 kg block.~|~translationMissing
Either you've been splitting stone into smaller blocks, or you're worse at quarrying stone than I expected.~|~translationMissing
Why won't you take more than 32 kg of stone?~|~translationMissing
Because, adventurer, I'm not going to carry more of your blocks than I absolutely must.~|~translationMissing
If your blocks are too big, break them with a chisel or a pick.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet given 32 kg~|~translationMissing
Continues above from "I need..."~|~translationMissing
If the player has given 32 kg~|~translationMissing
That's enough for the base of the statue, certainly.~|~translationMissing
Here you are, adventurer. Now, use a chisel to craft it into a base for the statue.~|~translationMissing
How am I supposed to carry that? It's huge!~|~translationMissing
Oh, stop whining. The last adventurer who helped me was carrying around a girl in a barrel.~|~translationMissing
Zamorak only knows why, but [he/she] didn't complain.~|~translationMissing
No, that's all for now.~|~translationMissing
I have this large block of sandstone you gave me...~|~translationMissing
I told you to carve it into the base of the statue, correct?~|~translationMissing
Yes, you did.~|~translationMissing
Then why are you standing around brainlessly? Get on with it!~|~translationMissing
You chisel away at the block of sandstone, and form the statue's base and legs.~|~translationMissing
I've made the base of the statue!~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Now, just put it on the flat ground next to me.~|~translationMissing
What do you want me to do now?~|~translationMissing
Hmph. Well, the base of the statue is done, but it needs a body. Twenty kilograms should be enough for you to make it.~|~translationMissing
I'll do it right away!~|~translationMissing
That makes [1-20] kg I'm carrying now.~|~translationMissing
I'm now carrying [1-20] kg of your inexpertly-quarried stone.~|~translationMissing
That's [1-20] kg I have now.~|~translationMissing
I need [1-20] kg more stone to make the body. Any more stone you want to burden me down with?~|~translationMissing
I need [1-20] kg more stone to make the body. Have you any more to make me carry?~|~translationMissing
I need [1-20] kg more stone to make the body. Do you have any more stone you want to offload onto me?~|~translationMissing
Why won't you take more than 20 kg of stone?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet given 20 kg~|~translationMissing
If the player has given 20 kg~|~translationMissing
That should be enough to use for the statue's body.~|~translationMissing
All you have to do with it, adventurer, is chisel it into the body of the statue.~|~translationMissing
I have this large block of sandstone you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Very nice, adventurer. You're supposed to make it into the statue's body.~|~translationMissing
Get your chisel ready and start working.~|~translationMissing
You chisel away at the block of sandstone, and form the statue's body.~|~translationMissing
I've made the statue's body!~|~translationMissing
Well done, adventurer. Not as dense as you look.~|~translationMissing
Go on, add it to the base of the statue.~|~translationMissing
You utter incompetent! Have you added the body to the statue yet?~|~translationMissing
Of course I have!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, then perhaps I'm still missing something...~|~translationMissing
What do you want me to do next?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't know, adventurer. Go and chisel the statue a bit more, or something.~|~translationMissing
Okay then.~|~translationMissing
It shouldn't have taken this long... did I miscalculate?~|~translationMissing
Ah, adventurer. As you can see, the statue is nearly complete. All it needs is a head.~|~translationMissing
The head should be made out of granite, which you can find in that quarry nearby.~|~translationMissing
As for whose head... well, perhaps I'll let you impose your own artistic vision on it.~|~translationMissing
Whose head do you think should be on the statue?~|~translationMissing
I think it should have my head!~|~translationMissing
Are you mad?~|~translationMissing
You'd start carving it, then you'd take a helmet off or change your hairstyle, and nobody would know who on Gielinor it was supposed to be!~|~translationMissing
Statues are far more permanent than you adventurers and your fashions.~|~translationMissing
So I can't put my head on the statue?~|~translationMissing
No. Now choose something sensible.~|~translationMissing
I think it should have your head.~|~translationMissing
After all, it's your statue.~|~translationMissing
Why, that's very generous of you, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Are you hoping for a bigger reward for saying that?~|~translationMissing
Er, maybe.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful. Well, at least you have me here for reference.~|~translationMissing
Now, go and find a suitable block of granite and make that head.~|~translationMissing
And do try to remember which one it is you're carving.~|~translationMissing
I think it should have a god's head.~|~translationMissing
And which god were you thinking of? There's very little reference material here in the desert.~|~translationMissing
That's true.~|~translationMissing
Whose head do you think I should make?~|~translationMissing
Well, some of the people in the desert worship a god called Icthlarin.~|~translationMissing
Or, if you prefer, I'm sure you could sculpt Zamorak instead.~|~translationMissing
I'll use Zamorak's head for the statue.~|~translationMissing
Ah, an excellent choice.~|~translationMissing
Now you should find a suitable block of granite, and make that head.~|~translationMissing
Try to remember which head you've decided to carve - I know you adventurers. Memories like fishing nets.~|~translationMissing
I'll use Icthlarin's head for the statue.~|~translationMissing
An interesting choice - I'm sure there's some reference material you can use around here.~|~translationMissing
Find a suitable block of granite, and get carving.~|~translationMissing
And make sure to remember which one you're supposed to be carving. I've known some of you adventurers to forget things you were told three seconds ago.~|~translationMissing
I think it should have a camel's head.~|~translationMissing
A human statue with a camel's head? Is there any particular reason?~|~translationMissing
Er, no. I just thought it would be funny.~|~translationMissing
Well, it is appropriate, all things considered...~|~translationMissing
Very well, it'll work well in a desert setting. Now, find a suitable block of granite, and carve that head.~|~translationMissing
Make sure you remember which head you're carving. The last adventurer who tried to help me forgot half- way through carving, and produced the strangest mixture of camel and human I've ever seen.~|~translationMissing
(If the player completed The Giant Dwarf~|~translationMissing
) You know, I've done something like this before...~|~translationMissing
You know, I've done something like this before.~|~translationMissing
I had to help rebuild a statue in the city of Keldagrim, and then choose whose head should be placed on the top!~|~translationMissing
Keldagrim? Hmph. Technically good sculptors, the dwarves, but they have no sense of art.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure that none of them would even think of travelling to the desert and building a statue here.~|~translationMissing
Can I use the head I chose for that statue on yours?~|~translationMissing
Do you even remember what it looked like?~|~translationMissing
Er... no.~|~translationMissing
Then no, you can't. Now, choose something else.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Which head did I decide to use for the statue?~|~translationMissing
The head of Lazim, the sculptor~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make Lazim~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make something else~|~translationMissing
The head of the god Zamorak~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make Zamorak~|~translationMissing
The head of the god Icthlarin~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make Icthlarin~|~translationMissing
There, that looks good.~|~translationMissing
The head of a camel~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make a camel~|~translationMissing
Was it supposed to look like that?~|~translationMissing
You carefully chisel the granite block into the likeness of a camel.~|~translationMissing
I have a head for the statue, but...~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure it's the right one.~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make Lazim's head~|~translationMissing
If the player made Lazim's head~|~translationMissing
You decided to make the statue's head look like me, you said.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I don't think much of your artistic skills, adventurer, but it's a passable likeness.~|~translationMissing
If the player made something else~|~translationMissing
...You really have a shorter attention span than a grain of sand, don't you?~|~translationMissing
You said you'd make the statue's head look like me, not like modern art!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I'll remember next time.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps it was too difficult for you. Do you want to change what head you'll make?~|~translationMissing
No, I'll stay with the one I chose first.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Remember, you're carving my head for the statue.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd like to change my choice.~|~translationMissing
Well, which will you choose this time?~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make Zamorak's head~|~translationMissing
If the player made Zamorak's head~|~translationMissing
You said you'd make the statue's head look like Zamorak.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. You're not a particularly good sculptor, adventurer, but it's at least recognisable.~|~translationMissing
Do you even remember who you were supposed be carving?~|~translationMissing
It was supposed to be Zamorak, not the horrific monstrosity you've carved!~|~translationMissing
But I thought that was what he looked like.~|~translationMissing
How dare you?~|~translationMissing
Ahem, that is to say, er...~|~translationMissing
Well, it was obviously too tough for you. Do you want to change what head you'll make?~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make Icthlarin's head~|~translationMissing
If the player made Icthlarin's head~|~translationMissing
Well, you said that you'd make the statue's head look like Icthlarin.~|~translationMissing
You're not much of an artist, but at least you did your research. It'll pass.~|~translationMissing
Weren't you supposed to be carving Icthlarin's head?~|~translationMissing
...I was?~|~translationMissing
Well, you're paying lots of attention, aren't you? Honestly, you adventurers.~|~translationMissing
It would be easier on your poor little brain if you changed what head you'll make, don't you agree?~|~translationMissing
If the player said they would make a camel's head~|~translationMissing
If the player made a camel head~|~translationMissing
You said you'd make the statue's head look like a camel, and that looks like...~|~translationMissing
Well, it wouldn't fool a camel, but it's close enough for the statue.~|~translationMissing
I don't believe it. You said you were planning to make a camel head, but what's this?~|~translationMissing
Er, not a camel head?~|~translationMissing
Correct, adventurer! Have a cake.~|~translationMissing
Of course not! Why would I give something to you for having a worse memory than a piece of burnt fish?~|~translationMissing
Do you want to change what head you'll make to something you have a chance of remembering?~|~translationMissing
Hold it! I know you adventurers.~|~translationMissing
I bet you've managed to make the wrong head, or something like that.~|~translationMissing
I know what I'm doing, honest...~|~translationMissing
I don't care if you think you know what you're doing. Let me have a look at that head.~|~translationMissing
Fine, fine...~|~translationMissing
Continues above from after "Let me see..."~|~translationMissing
The statue breaks through the ground.~|~translationMissing
Lazim pushes the player into the hole.~|~translationMissing
Ouch!~|~translationMissing
Argh, my duodenum!~|~translationMissing
The player wakes up in Enakhra's Temple.~|~translationMissing
Ow... Lazim has some explaining to do!~|~translationMissing
Ah, excellent, it's all gone as planned.~|~translationMissing
Gone as planned?~|~translationMissing
We just fell through the ground into some weird temple!~|~translationMissing
Of course we did! That's why I had you build a statue.~|~translationMissing
I don't think you really are a sculptor. What are you looking for in this temple?~|~translationMissing
Oh, nothing. No treasure here. No priceless artefacts from the lost ages of Gielinor, or anything like that.~|~translationMissing
I'll be leaving, then.~|~translationMissing
Wait! If you help me, then...~|~translationMissing
I'll give you a share of whatever we find.~|~translationMissing
That sounds better. So, where's the treasure?~|~translationMissing
At the top of the temple. We've fallen through to the very bottom, so you'll have to climb up to the next floor.~|~translationMissing
That's good, but...~|~translationMissing
How do I get further into the temple?~|~translationMissing
The stories I've heard say there are odd doors in this temple, that have locks that don't need keys, but... rather large limbs.~|~translationMissing
Yuck!~|~translationMissing
You can use your chisel or pick to take them from the statue. They should be the right size.~|~translationMissing
Be thankful they're the statue's limbs and not yours, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where the statue's head is?~|~translationMissing
Ah, it fell off when the statue dropped through the ceiling. I've been keeping it safe since then.~|~translationMissing
Try not to lose it, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the stone head~|~translationMissing
You didn't get far from here before you mislaid it.~|~translationMissing
This time, try not to drop it.~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the stone heead~|~translationMissing
...You're carrying it, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Been at the Asgarnian Ale a little too much, have we?~|~translationMissing
(If the player doesn't have the left arm~|~translationMissing
) Remove the statue's left arm~|~translationMissing
You carefully remove the statue's left arm. It's very heavy.~|~translationMissing
(If the player doesn't have the right arm~|~translationMissing
) Remove the statue's right arm~|~translationMissing
You carefully remove the statue's right arm. It's very heavy.~|~translationMissing
(If the player doesn't have the left leg~|~translationMissing
) Remove the statue's left leg~|~translationMissing
You carefully remove the statue's left leg. It's very heavy.~|~translationMissing
(If the player doesn't have the right leg~|~translationMissing
) Remove the statue's right leg~|~translationMissing
You carefully remove the statue's right leg. It's very heavy.~|~translationMissing
Could you make these stone limbs easier to carry?~|~translationMissing
They're really heavy, and they weigh me down.~|~translationMissing
Of course not! I'm not a carnival conjurer.~|~translationMissing
Adversity builds character, adventurer. Heft them around by yourself.~|~translationMissing
Oh, okay.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the right arm~|~translationMissing
I mislaid the statue's right arm.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I'm useful to have around at these times. I found it when you dropped it around here.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the left arm~|~translationMissing
I can't find the statue's left arm.~|~translationMissing
It's lucky for you that I notice these things. Here, you managed to drop it in this room.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the left leg~|~translationMissing
Er... I don't know where I put the statue's left leg.~|~translationMissing
You dropped it near the statue. Do I have to hold your hand through everything?~|~translationMissing
Here it is.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the right left~|~translationMissing
I lost the statue's right leg.~|~translationMissing
Well, it didn't go far - I found it in here. Take better care of it next time.~|~translationMissing
Ow, my head...~|~translationMissing
You place the arm in the lock. It fits exactly.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene begins.~|~translationMissing
At last, it's complete. A temple fit for my lord.~|~translationMissing
You take the metal sigil. It's cold to the touch.~|~translationMissing
You place the leg in the lock. It fits exactly.~|~translationMissing
Knight~|~translationMissing
All right, men, destroy that evil sorceress... and her temple with her!~|~translationMissing
You will never have this temple - it belongs to my lord!~|~translationMissing
Enakhra casts a spell that kills three of the knights.~|~translationMissing
F-for Avarrocka!~|~translationMissing
Ah ha ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
Enakhra casts a spell that freezes the final knight.~|~translationMissing
Aaaaaargh!~|~translationMissing
Well, why would Zamorak want a temple? You said he needed weapons instead.~|~translationMissing
I wish I'd never supported him.~|~translationMissing
So you've seen sense? You'll join our side?~|~translationMissing
Akthanakos walks away and Enakhra laughs.~|~translationMissing
Heh heh heh...~|~translationMissing
Surely this would make a good weapon...~|~translationMissing
Enakhra casts a spell on some bones. A skeleton spawns, then turns back into bones.~|~translationMissing
No, no! Curse it, that doesn't work!~|~translationMissing
You place the sigil in the lock. It fits exactly.~|~translationMissing
Can you help me with this pedestal I've found?~|~translationMissing
What pedestal?~|~translationMissing
It's on the floor above this. It looks sort of important.~|~translationMissing
Really? Did it have some sort of recess on the top?~|~translationMissing
Now that you mention it, it did...~|~translationMissing
In that case, perhaps you should try using the head of the statue on it.~|~translationMissing
If the player never got the statue's head~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the statue's head~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the statue's head~|~translationMissing
Yes, and I tried using the statue's head with it...~|~translationMissing
...but it didn't fit properly.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Intriguing, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you should find out what shape the recess is, so you can sculpt something that will fit in it.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure that will work?~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, I know more about this temple than you do.~|~translationMissing
All you need to do is make a mould of the recess somehow, then use it as a guide to make another head.~|~translationMissing
It should be made from the same granite as the statue's head was.~|~translationMissing
You press the soft clay into the hollow, and make a positive mould of it.~|~translationMissing
You carefully chisel the granite block to match the mould you made.~|~translationMissing
You place the stone head into the hollow. It fits exactly.~|~translationMissing
Ow, not another headache...~|~translationMissing
But it's still a nice temple, isn't it?~|~translationMissing
Wait... What is this?~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha. You believed me, didn't you?~|~translationMissing
I would never desert my lord!~|~translationMissing
Akthanakos is frozen.~|~translationMissing
Well done unlocking those doors, adventurer. Did you have any problems?~|~translationMissing
I saw some really strange visions. Everything went grey...~|~translationMissing
Those are some of the traps to keep people away from this temple.~|~translationMissing
Thankfully, they didn't send you mad this time.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound good.~|~translationMissing
So, are we at the top of the temple now?~|~translationMissing
No, there is another floor above this. You have to go up a ladder in the room to the north.~|~translationMissing
Hah, that's easy. Treasure, here I come!~|~translationMissing
There's a magic barrier in the way. And right now, it won't let anything through.~|~translationMissing
Is there any other way to get upstairs?~|~translationMissing
No, but I suspect the other rooms on this floor have magical properties. If you solve all the puzzles they present, then...~|~translationMissing
How will I know when I've solved them?~|~translationMissing
Oh, it'll be quite obvious.~|~translationMissing
The globes on the pedestal here will also light when you've solved the room they correspond to.~|~translationMissing
Pentyn~|~translationMissing
Have you come to torture me again?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you may look human, but I know you're not. I've heard stories.~|~translationMissing
How you Mahjarrat can take on any form, and use magic to inflict pain without any weapons.~|~translationMissing
I, er... what?~|~translationMissing
I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm just as human as you are.~|~translationMissing
You'll never get what you want from me. I'm a soldier of Avarrocka, and will stand strong!~|~translationMissing
Look, I'm not going to hurt you!~|~translationMissing
Besides, I am already wounded, and have been so for many years, thanks to this spell you cast on me. And hungry. So very, very hungry.~|~translationMissing
I've got some food you can have. It's quite tasty.~|~translationMissing
Here, try this. It should fill you up.~|~translationMissing
Have some of this food. It's really good, I promise!~|~translationMissing
If the player gives bread~|~translationMissing
My daughter was learning to cook this when I left.~|~translationMissing
I haven't remembered her in so long... thank you for reminding me of her.~|~translationMissing
If the player gives cake~|~translationMissing
A cake? There's nothing to celebrate, is there?~|~translationMissing
So many years gone by. My children must have grown up and left home.~|~translationMissing
I haven't remembered them in so long... thank you for reminding me of them.~|~translationMissing
Are you feeling better now?~|~translationMissing
Yes, thank you.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that I'm trapped here, but I still remember something of this floor of the temple.~|~translationMissing
If you need any hints about the rooms nearby, I can give you some help.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the room with the fountain.~|~translationMissing
When we came to the temple, that fountain was frosted with ice.~|~translationMissing
Even chipping at it with swords or lighting fires under it didn't do anything.~|~translationMissing
My guess is that some sort of magic is keeping it that way.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the room with the furnace.~|~translationMissing
I tried to go in there, but the smoke was so thick I could barely see the furnace.~|~translationMissing
It may be that it's blocked, in which case you'll have to clear it out.~|~translationMissing
A good breeze should do the trick.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the dark room.~|~translationMissing
I never went in there myself, but I peered through the door.~|~translationMissing
There seemed to be fires of some sort all around the room, but they were burning low.~|~translationMissing
I'd imagine they've gone out by now.~|~translationMissing
It's okay, I don't need any help.~|~translationMissing
With a hiss of steam, the ice melts away from the fountain.~|~translationMissing
For the north-west brazier~|~translationMissing
It looks like there was once a maple log fire burning here.~|~translationMissing
For the south-west brazier~|~translationMissing
It looks like there was once a normal log fire burning here.~|~translationMissing
For the south brazier~|~translationMissing
It looks like there was once an oak fire burning here.~|~translationMissing
For the north brazier~|~translationMissing
It looks like there was once a candle burning here.~|~translationMissing
For the north-east brazier~|~translationMissing
It looks like there was once a coal fire burning here.~|~translationMissing
For the south-east brazier~|~translationMissing
It looks like there was once a willow log fire burning here.~|~translationMissing
You place the maple logs in the brazier, and carefully light them.~|~translationMissing
You place the logs in the brazier, and carefully light them.~|~translationMissing
You place the oak logs in the brazier, and carefully light them.~|~translationMissing
You place the lit candle carefully in the brazier.~|~translationMissing
You place the coal in the brazier, and carefully light it.~|~translationMissing
You place the willow logs in the brazier, and carefully light them.~|~translationMissing
Wind rushes through the furnace, clearing away what's blocking it.~|~translationMissing
The smoke clears from the room.~|~translationMissing
You walk through the barrier easily.~|~translationMissing
The treasure's up ahead, adventurer. Be careful of the traps.~|~translationMissing
What traps?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't know. Perhaps, say, huge skeletons that'll tear your arms and legs off?~|~translationMissing
Nothing, adventurer, nothing. You just trot along and get that treasure, now.~|~translationMissing
Boneguard~|~translationMissing
Leave this temple at once, or I shall be forced to attack!~|~translationMissing
I will defend this door until I am released from this prison of bone...~|~translationMissing
You shall not pass me, unless I crumble into dust!~|~translationMissing
These bones that trap me will block your path!~|~translationMissing
Now, flee before I attack you!~|~translationMissing
The Boneguard attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
Freed Spirit~|~translationMissing
Thank you, kind [sir/lady]... now I am free from my imprisonment.~|~translationMissing
I no longer need these bones - take them, please, and bury what you can.~|~translationMissing
The spirit disappears with a soft sigh.~|~translationMissing
Leave this place, before I am forced to attack!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have protect from melee enabled~|~translationMissing
The Boneguard attacks the player once.~|~translationMissing
Someone so easy to hit isn't worth my time!~|~translationMissing
If the player has protect from melee enabled~|~translationMissing
If you value your life, young [man/woman], then flee!~|~translationMissing
You should not be here! This is a dangerous place for beings such as you!~|~translationMissing
I am impressed, young [man/woman]. You seem to have more resilience than those I have fought off before.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps, then, you could help me with my predicament?~|~translationMissing
Why, what's wrong?~|~translationMissing
I am trapped in this form against my will... it has been a long and painful struggle to even regain control over my own mind.~|~translationMissing
Who's trapped you in this form?~|~translationMissing
Same as below from "Who's trapped you in this form?"~|~translationMissing
Why did you attack me?~|~translationMissing
I didn't do anything to deserve it!~|~translationMissing
As I said, I am trapped like this against my will.~|~translationMissing
I am forced to defend the one who enslaved me from any harm, even though it disgusts me to do so!~|~translationMissing
SHE has. She was my rival before we came to this world, and supported that upstart Zamorak in his quest to be a god.~|~translationMissing
It angers me to think at how she tricked me into slavery...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I understand, but who is 'she'?~|~translationMissing
Her name is Enakhra, and she is the one who made this accursed temple and this boneguard that I am trapped in.~|~translationMissing
Now, since you show some interest in my situation, will you help me?~|~translationMissing
Of course, I'll help you out. But first of all, do you have any treasure?~|~translationMissing
I, er, was just wondering...~|~translationMissing
Certainly, young [man/woman]. If you help me, I will give you a valuable amulet, and some of my knowledge.~|~translationMissing
That's good enough for me. What do I have to do?~|~translationMissing
Enakhra keeps me trapped in this form with magic.~|~translationMissing
Her hold over me grew weaker over the years, and I began to build a wall to keep her trapped in her own temple forever.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, she has strengthened her spells lately, and I can no longer will myself to continue building.~|~translationMissing
I want you to finish building this wall, that we might seal her in this temple forever, where she cannot taint the world with her creations again.~|~translationMissing
About this wall...~|~translationMissing
Where do I get the stone?~|~translationMissing
There is a pile of rubble nearby, made of blocks that have fallen from the walls and the ceiling over time.~|~translationMissing
I have been trapped here for several thousand years, after all...~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else you wish to know?~|~translationMissing
How do I build the wall?~|~translationMissing
Since the blocks are heavy, you will need to be quite strong in order to lift them up to the wall.~|~translationMissing
Once you have placed the stones up on the wall, you must trim them with a chisel so that they do not fall off when you place the next layer.~|~translationMissing
How long will it take?~|~translationMissing
I was not far from finishing, I must say. It will most likely only take you three loads to finish building it.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about Enakhra?~|~translationMissing
She is a coward, and a despicable traitor. She even supported Zamorak when he tried to become a god.~|~translationMissing
Of course, even though she built a temple for him, he didn't care, and she's been hiding here ever since.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about yourself?~|~translationMissing
I was once a proud mage, and now look at me. Trapped inside a bone skeleton and forced to defend my rival's temple.~|~translationMissing
To think I believed her when she said she wanted to become allies and make amends for our rivalry!~|~translationMissing
That two-faced, conniving, backstabbing wretch...~|~translationMissing
I suppose it is our nature, after all.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll start building.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Once you are finished, the wall itself will shield me from most of her magic, and I will be free to move once more.~|~translationMissing
Of course, I'll help you out.~|~translationMissing
Same as above from "Of course, I'll help you out. But first of all, do you have any treasure?"~|~translationMissing
Well, adventurer, do you have the treasure yet?~|~translationMissing
There doesn't seem to be any treasure there.~|~translationMissing
None at all?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... the big skeleton promised to give me something if I helped him.~|~translationMissing
Ah ha! So, it's not attacking you? Well done, adventurer. Your second brain cell must be working overtime today.~|~translationMissing
You add the stone to the wall.~|~translationMissing
You trim the stone that was added to the wall.~|~translationMissing
No! What have you done?~|~translationMissing
The wall's finally built!~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Thank you very much for all your help.~|~translationMissing
I can feel Enakhra's control over me fading. Finally, I can be free from this imprisonment...~|~translationMissing
The Boneguard turns into Akthanakos.~|~translationMissing
After thousands of years... finally, I am no longer her slave.~|~translationMissing
Honour demands that I reward you... and yet you have no room to carry my reward. Please, return when you can take it from me.~|~translationMissing
As thanks for your help, young [man/woman], please take this amulet of mine.~|~translationMissing
Wow. Er, what does it do?~|~translationMissing
It allows you to understand the speech of the Ugthanki, my patron animals, and other camels.~|~translationMissing
It is also bound to the desert, and can thus transport you back to this temple if you wish.~|~translationMissing
Continues with Enakhra cutscene.~|~translationMissing
After so many years, why didn't you just give up?~|~translationMissing
Now my lord will punish you for destroying his weapon.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha... in that case, I'm sure lord Zaros will be happy to intervene.~|~translationMissing
Akthanakos and Enakhra transform into skeleton forms.~|~translationMissing
I'll be waiting for you in the north, Akthanakos.~|~translationMissing
It'll be a pleasure to fight you once more...~|~translationMissing
They both teleport away.~|~translationMissing
Well, thank you, adventurer. You've just deprived me of a wonderful chance to learn from one of Zamorak's first followers.~|~translationMissing
What? What about that treasure you were looking for?~|~translationMissing
You utter imbecile! Did you think I was looking for gold?~|~translationMissing
I want knowledge!~|~translationMissing
Um... sorry.~|~translationMissing
'Sorry' won't bring those Mahjarrat back.~|~translationMissing
*sigh* I might as well stay to study this temple. It has some interesting magical properties.~|~translationMissing
Ooh, you're a mage? Can you teach me any spells?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I've dropped hints the size of Varrock, but you might not have noticed. I'm a Zamorakian mage.~|~translationMissing
If you really want to learn my spells, you'll have to dedicate yourself to Zamorak.~|~translationMissing
I couldn't do that!~|~translationMissing
Then you won't be learning any of my spells.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
You're not very nice, are you?~|~translationMissing
What did you expect from a Zamorakian mage?~|~translationMissing
Sure, sign me up!~|~translationMissing
You really thought I would teach you my secrets just like that? Ha ha ha! You are a naive fool.~|~translationMissing
That's not very nice of you.~|~translationMissing
I'm a mage of Zamorak, after all. What else do you expect?~|~translationMissing
How are you and your defective brain doing nowadays, adventurer?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the camulet~|~translationMissing
I've lost the amulet that Akthanakos gave me.~|~translationMissing
You scatterbrained fool. You dropped it in here. Since you have no space to carry it, I can't give it back yet.~|~translationMissing
You really are an idiot, aren't you? You dropped it in here when you left. Try not to lose it next time.~|~translationMissing
Lazim returns the Camulet to you.~|~translationMissing
Hey! That's not very nice.~|~translationMissing
I'm not very nice. If you want to see who ruined all of my plans, adventurer, just look in a mirror.~|~translationMissing
Suit yourself. At least I got a nice amulet for my trouble.~|~translationMissing
If the player unlocked unlimited charges~|~translationMissing
And don't forget who gave it unlimited charges for you!~|~translationMissing
About that amulet - I might be able to improve it for you, for a fee. Have you got it with you?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the amulet in the bank~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have it on me at the moment. I must have stored it somewhere.~|~translationMissing
Of course you did. I bet you spend your life collecting junk, storing it, then complaining you've run out of storage space. Fetch the amulet if you want my help.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the amulet~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've got it here.~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's what I thought. This amulet will run out of charges all the time, if you keep using it. For one million coins I can give it unlimited charges.~|~translationMissing
Why do you need so much money for it?~|~translationMissing
Three reasons. Firstly, I'm a Zamorakian mage - we're not big on charity work. Secondly, I want the money. Finally, in case you need reminding, I hate you.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the coins~|~translationMissing
Right. Well, I haven't got that kind of money on me.~|~translationMissing
Okay, here's one million coins.~|~translationMissing
I'm not interested.~|~translationMissing
Your loss.~|~translationMissing

11.2 Talking to Auguste again before he is replaced with Assistant Stan~|~translationMissing
Auguste~|~translationMissing
Greetings! Would you like to be my number one  accomplice? I mean, assistant?~|~translationMissing
I am Auguste. I am going to be the first balloonist in all of Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
Balloo-what? I thought only monks lived on Entrana.~|~translationMissing
Well, they do... I was a monk. But I'm so sick of living on this island! I want to explore new frontiers!~|~translationMissing
And go where no man has gone before?~|~translationMissing
Maybe! That sounds good. I was thinking just over to Taverley, though.~|~translationMissing
Why not take the boat then?~|~translationMissing
Ugh! Ocean! Don't talk to me about the ocean...oh dear...I feel ill.~|~translationMissing
Whoa, ok, no ocean. How exactly are you going to get off the island, then?~|~translationMissing
I have devised a new way to travel. But I need an assistant balloonist to help me build my design.~|~translationMissing
Are you an experienced adventurer willing to help me?~|~translationMissing
Start the Enlightened Journey quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Sign me up.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Let's get started.~|~translationMissing
Wait, I still don't know exactly what we're doing.~|~translationMissing
Of course, of course, how foolish of me. Well, we are going to make a balloon.~|~translationMissing
Which is what exactly?~|~translationMissing
Let me show you!~|~translationMissing
(balloon construction diagram interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Oh, never mind then.~|~translationMissing
How exactly do you plan to get to Taverley in that? How will it work?~|~translationMissing
Have you noticed how ashes float above fires for long periods of time?~|~translationMissing
Umm, yes. What's your point?~|~translationMissing
What's your point?~|~translationMissing
Don't you see? It's the hot air! It rises, taking the ashes with it.~|~translationMissing
I had this epiphany while I was at the glass blower's house. If we pump hot air into an envelope it will rise because it is lighter than the cold air around it.~|~translationMissing
Come again?~|~translationMissing
We are going to sew a big sack and light a fire under it. Once the sack fills with hot air it will begin to rise, taking us along with it in the basket.~|~translationMissing
You seem pretty confident about this. Have you tested it?~|~translationMissing
Well, no. You see, I don't have the materials here to make any test balloons.~|~translationMissing
That's where you come in!~|~translationMissing
You are going to collect materials for two test runs of the balloon.~|~translationMissing
You will need to get three sheets of papyrus, one ball of wool, one full sack of potatoes, and one unlit candle.~|~translationMissing
What am I supposed to do with all of that junk?~|~translationMissing
When you have all of it, bring it to me and I'll explain what to do next. Any questions?~|~translationMissing
Where do I get all this stuff?~|~translationMissing
Err, no. I can't see that kind of detail.~|~translationMissing
You don't? Oh...well...it's just, they rise, you know, from the fire...Maybe you should pay more attention to things!~|~translationMissing
Have you gotten the materials?~|~translationMissing
If the player has all the required materials~|~translationMissing
Good, you have everything! Now, I need you to create an origami balloon.~|~translationMissing
How do you make the origami balloon?~|~translationMissing
First, use the papyrus on the ball of wool. The papyrus is folded into an origami box and the yarn will support the heat source.~|~translationMissing
Next, add the unlit candle to the balloon structure. It will act as the heat source.~|~translationMissing
Once you have done that let me know and we will begin our experiment.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the required materials in noted form~|~translationMissing
What am I supposed to do with a note? I can't make a balloon from notes!~|~translationMissing
With none of the requested materials~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to have any of the materials.~|~translationMissing
You need a ball of wool, three sheets of papyrus, an unlit candle, and a full sack of potatoes.~|~translationMissing
With a sack of potatoes, an unlit candle, a ball of wool, and 1?2 papyrus~|~translationMissing
You need more papyrus.~|~translationMissing

Failure is not an option.~|~translationMissing
(If the player does not have all of the required materials) What do I need to get again?~|~translationMissing
What do I need to get again?~|~translationMissing
I lost some items, what do I need again?~|~translationMissing
You create the origami balloon structure.~|~translationMissing
You create an origami balloon.~|~translationMissing
I just need a plain origami balloon. The dye could contaminate the experiment.~|~translationMissing
I finished the origami balloon!~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! I'll take that, and we'll conduct our first experiment.~|~translationMissing
Cutscene where the player launches the balloon and it burns down~|~translationMissing
That was perfect. My hypothesis was right!~|~translationMissing
Did you not see the burning?~|~translationMissing
One more test. Then we shall proceed.~|~translationMissing
Burning? Fire? Hello?~|~translationMissing
We shall meekly go! No...no...it needs to sound grander. We shall cautiously go...~|~translationMissing
We're doomed.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the other two sheets of papyrus and a full sack of potatoes?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have them here.~|~translationMissing
If the player has them~|~translationMissing
Commendable. If I may have those, I will construct this experiment.~|~translationMissing
Cutscene where the player launches the balloon, a flash mob with pitchforks attack and the balloon burns down.~|~translationMissing
Moe~|~translationMissing
Destroy the floating thing!~|~translationMissing
Well, that went down like a lead balloon.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have potatoes or enough papyrus~|~translationMissing
You need a full sack of potatoes and more papyrus.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have potatoes~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough papyrus~|~translationMissing
Oh, I've misplaced them.~|~translationMissing
Those peasants...where did they come from?~|~translationMissing
Ahh, the flash mob phenomenon. Many have hypothesized that they are beings of great power sent to smite those who question the gods.~|~translationMissing
And this isn't worrying because...?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry! I know exactly what I'm doing.~|~translationMissing
Those experiments went extraordinarily well.~|~translationMissing
Was I the ONLY one who saw them burning? BURNING???~|~translationMissing
Yes, very well indeed. Now we will start building the balloon that will carry us off the island.~|~translationMissing
This task will be much greater than the last two. I hope you are prepared for it.~|~translationMissing
This is madness.~|~translationMissing
You need to get the following items~|~translationMissing
Yellow dye Red dye Ten pieces of silk A clay bowl~|~translationMissing
and eight sandbags.~|~translationMissing
Sandbags can be made by getting empty sacks and filling them at the sand pit here on Entrana.~|~translationMissing
You can bring items back to me as you get them, while you are waiting for the tree to grow.~|~translationMissing
What tree?~|~translationMissing
I am going to give you a willow sapling and a basket of apples. You must plant the willow sapling at a tree patch.~|~translationMissing
If you give the basket of apples to the gardener near the patch, he will look after the tree for you while it grows.~|~translationMissing
Don't lose the sapling! It took me a long time to save up enough for one. If you do, you'll have to pay me 30,000 coins for a new one.~|~translationMissing
Once the tree is fully grown, cut twelve branches from it using secateurs. Bring the branches back here and use them on the metal frame on the platform to create the basket.~|~translationMissing
If there are two open inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
Here you go. Now be very careful not to lose it!~|~translationMissing
If there are not two open inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
Looks like you don't have enough room in your inventory for the basket and the sapling. Come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
Do you have anything for me?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I want to give you some items.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not handed in both dyes) Dye.~|~translationMissing
Here's the dye.~|~translationMissing
If the player has red and yellow dye~|~translationMissing
Ah, wonderful, yellow dye. Thank you.~|~translationMissing
Red dye! Thank you.~|~translationMissing
If all the materials are finally handed in~|~translationMissing
That's the last of it!~|~translationMissing
You just need to build the basket and I can finish the balloon! How are you getting on with the willow?~|~translationMissing
(If Auguste's sapping hasn't been planted yet) I have lost my willow sapling. Can I buy a replacement?~|~translationMissing
What do I do again?~|~translationMissing
Use the willow sapling I gave you to grow a willow tree. Cut twelve branches from it using secateurs. Use the branches on the platform here.~|~translationMissing
Fine thanks.~|~translationMissing
If not all the materials are finally handed in~|~translationMissing
If the player only has yellow dye~|~translationMissing
If the player has not handed in red dye yet~|~translationMissing
I still need red dye for the balloon.~|~translationMissing
If the player only has red dye~|~translationMissing
If the player has not handed in yellow dye yet~|~translationMissing
I still need yellow dye for the balloon.~|~translationMissing
If the player has neither dye and hasn't handed in either~|~translationMissing
You don't have any dye with you.~|~translationMissing
I need red and yellow dye for the balloon.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have red dye and has handed in yellow~|~translationMissing
I need red dye for the balloon.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have yellow dye and has handed in red~|~translationMissing
I need yellow dye for the balloon.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not handed in 8 sandbags already) Sandbags.~|~translationMissing
Here are the sandbags.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 8 sandbags~|~translationMissing
Sandbags, thank you. This will allow us to change height.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 8 sandbags~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough sandbags. Please bring me eight.~|~translationMissing
However, there are other sand pits around the world that will work as well.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not handed in 10 silk already) Silk.~|~translationMissing
Here's the silk.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 10 noted silk~|~translationMissing
What am I supposed to do with a note?? I can't make a balloon from notes!~|~translationMissing
If the player has 10 silk~|~translationMissing
Silk for the balloon, thank you.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 10 silk~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough silk. Please bring me ten pieces.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not handed in a bowl already) Bowl.~|~translationMissing
Here's the bowl.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a noted bowl~|~translationMissing
If the player has an unfired bowl~|~translationMissing
You need to fire that bowl.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a bowl~|~translationMissing
Ah the bowl. This will be used to hold the fuel while it heats the air in the balloon.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a bowl~|~translationMissing
I'm having some trouble finding some of the items.~|~translationMissing
What do you need help with?~|~translationMissing
Dye.~|~translationMissing
I was told a while ago that there was a witch who made dye in Draynor Village. Maybe you should start by looking there.~|~translationMissing
Sandbags.~|~translationMissing
Silk.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I believe silk is imported from the desert. Perhaps someone there can tell you where to find it.~|~translationMissing
Bowl.~|~translationMissing
I think there is a spare one in the glass blower's house. I rent a room from him there, so I don't think he'll mind you taking it.~|~translationMissing
I have lost my willow sapling. Can I buy a replacement?~|~translationMissing
It will cost you 30,000 gold coins to replace it, do you want to pay that?~|~translationMissing
If his sapling is still in the inventory~|~translationMissing
You already have one! Don't be greedy.~|~translationMissing
If his sapling is in the bank~|~translationMissing
You already have one in your bank! Don't be greedy.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough money~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough money for it. You should have been more careful.~|~translationMissing
Looks like you don't have enough room in your inventory. Come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the sapling, has enough money and inventory space~|~translationMissing
Here you go. Now be very careful not to lose it again!~|~translationMissing
No way!~|~translationMissing
You have now planted Auguste's sapling. He will not give you any more.~|~translationMissing
You plant the special willow sapling in the tree patch.~|~translationMissing
You need to use that on the balloon frame on the platform.~|~translationMissing
You do not have enough willow branches.~|~translationMissing
Great! Let me just put it all together and we'll be ready for lift off! Speak to me again in a moment.~|~translationMissing
The balloon is constructed and waiting for departure~|~translationMissing
Well, let's get going!~|~translationMissing
Wait, tell me what we're doing.~|~translationMissing
Theoretically, we are ready for the maiden voyage.~|~translationMissing
Theoretically?~|~translationMissing
Well, of course. With you piloting I am sure we will survive.~|~translationMissing
WHAT!? This is your balloon! Why aren't you going to pilot it? And what do you mean 'survive'? You never said anything about me flying this bird!~|~translationMissing
Don't be silly. I'm not going to pilot it. We will be safe in the basket, the only thing we will lose are the logs.~|~translationMissing
You will pilot it, won't you?~|~translationMissing
Fine, I will.~|~translationMissing
Fine, I will. So how do I control the balloon?~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Let me explain my hypothesis on how to control a balloon.~|~translationMissing
Oh no, not another hypothesis!~|~translationMissing
The balloon needs ten normal logs for fuel. I believe the balloon will be controlled based on weight, so you must not have more than 40 kg with you.~|~translationMissing
Also, I seem to have lost my tinderbox...do you think you could bring one? We need it to light the fire.~|~translationMissing
And here, I thought all the legwork was done. Fine, I'll bring a tinderbox.~|~translationMissing
Right! So, the balloon mechanics. Your prime direction will always be to land the balloon on the target at the end of our route.~|~translationMissing
I've written to some friends in Taverley who have kindly painted one on the ground there.~|~translationMissing
We must avoid everything, because the balloon is very fragile. Even clouds will be dangerous! But if my calculations are correct, we will be able to squeeze through some surprising spaces, if you pilot it well.~|~translationMissing
Those sandbags you made earlier will give the balloon a big lift when dropped, whereas adding the logs will only make it rise a little bit. But don't use them up too quickly! We have no way of replenishing them.~|~translationMissing
If you do run out of logs and sandbags you will not be able to go up any longer. Just make the best of it and hope we can make it to our destination without going upwards.~|~translationMissing
I've added two ropes, the red one is an emergency rope, it will let the hot air out of the balloon and we will drop quickly. The other rope will only drop us a little.~|~translationMissing
If we get into tribb...beg your pardon, trouble, in all likelihood we will crash. But do not fear! We should be fine. Just make sure you come back to Entrana so we can try again.~|~translationMissing
If it all goes horribly wrong, you can always bail. If we're still over Entrana, we can land quickly and try again. However, once past the island, we will crash.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to go?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not ready.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pet out~|~translationMissing
You need to put your pet into your inventory before the flight.~|~translationMissing
If the player weighs more than 40kg~|~translationMissing
You have too much weight in your bag. You may only bring 40kg of weight.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 10 normal logs and a tinderbox~|~translationMissing
When you travel with logs in storage as well as your inventory, which would you like to use? This can be changed at any of the storage crates.~|~translationMissing
Which logs would you like to use up first?~|~translationMissing
Take logs from my inventory first.~|~translationMissing
(Balloon transport flying interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Take logs from storage first.~|~translationMissing
Ask me what logs to use every time.~|~translationMissing
Use logs from inventory~|~translationMissing
Use logs from storage~|~translationMissing
You need a tinderbox.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 10 normal logs~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough logs. You need ten normal logs.~|~translationMissing
You bail, but land safely on Entrana.~|~translationMissing
The balloon crashes.~|~translationMissing
Great Scott! Ocean! Ahhh!~|~translationMissing
Crashed, off course. Ocean! Oh dear... I feel very...~|~translationMissing
Contemplative? Concerned for your life? Desperate?~|~translationMissing
No...more along the lines of ill...You might want to swim away now. Use the plank...~|~translationMissing
How are you going to get back? What about the balloon?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure a fishing trawler will come by and give me a lift. Don't worry, I shall return.~|~translationMissing
You climb onto the plank and swim to shore.~|~translationMissing
Fade out to the player climbing back onto land.~|~translationMissing
You manage to swim back to shore.~|~translationMissing
Well, that didn't go as planned.~|~translationMissing
So what now? How will we get the balloon back?~|~translationMissing
You walk away from the crash site.~|~translationMissing
Fade out to the player outside Falador's eastern wall.~|~translationMissing
You arrive safely in Taverley.~|~translationMissing
We have travelled in a way that no man has travelled before! The next step will be to go where no men have gone before.~|~translationMissing
[player name], it has been a privilege flying with you.~|~translationMissing
For all your hard work, I give you this jacket and cap for future ballooning adventures.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 2 free inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 2 free inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough space in your inventory. Speak to me again when you do.~|~translationMissing
So what are you going to do now?~|~translationMissing
I am considering starting a balloon enterprise. People all over Gielinor will be able to travel in a new, exciting way.~|~translationMissing
As my first assistant, you will always be welcome to use a balloon. You'll have to bring your own fuel, though.~|~translationMissing
I will base my operations in Entrana. If you'd like to travel to new places, come see me there.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to use the balloon? Just so you know, some locations require special logs and high Firemaking skills.~|~translationMissing
Weapons are not allowed on Entrana. I must search you first.~|~translationMissing
You are quickly searched.~|~translationMissing
If the player has contraband~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, no weapons or armour may be worn to Entrana. Come back when you have laid them down.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have contraband~|~translationMissing
The player takes the balloon transport system back to Entrana.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me how to make an origami balloon?~|~translationMissing
Now you have an origami balloon!~|~translationMissing
If you use your origami balloon with any dye, you can change the colour.~|~translationMissing
You can release the balloon and watch it float in the air, just use a tinderbox on it.~|~translationMissing

Veronica~|~translationMissing
Can you please help me? I'm in a terrible spot of trouble.~|~translationMissing
Aha, sounds like a quest. I'll help.~|~translationMissing
Yes yes, I suppose it is a quest. My fiance Ernest and I came upon this house.~|~translationMissing
Seeing as we were a little lost Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions.~|~translationMissing
That was an hour ago. That house looks spooky, can you go and see if you can find him for me?~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, thank you. I'm very grateful.~|~translationMissing
Ernest the Chicken is started.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm looking for something to kill.~|~translationMissing
Oooh, you violent person you.~|~translationMissing
Have you found my sweetheart yet?~|~translationMissing
Professor Oddenstein~|~translationMissing
Be careful in here, there's lots of dangerous equipment.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a guy called Ernest.~|~translationMissing
Ah Ernest, top notch bloke. He's helping me with my experiments.~|~translationMissing
So you know where he is then?~|~translationMissing
He's that chicken over there.~|~translationMissing
Ernest is a chicken...? Are you sure?~|~translationMissing
Oh, he isn't normally a chicken, or at least he wasn't until he helped me test my pouletmorph machine.~|~translationMissing
It was originally going to be called a transmutation machine. But after testing pouletmorph seems more appropriate.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad Veronica didn't actually get engaged to a chicken.~|~translationMissing
Who's Veronica?~|~translationMissing
Ernest's fiancee. She probably doesn't want to marry a chicken.~|~translationMissing
Ooh I dunno. She could have free eggs for breakfast.~|~translationMissing
I think you'd better change him back.~|~translationMissing
Umm... It's not so easy...~|~translationMissing
My machine is broken, and the house gremlins have run off with some vital bits.~|~translationMissing
Well I can look for them.~|~translationMissing
That would be a help. They'll be somewhere in the manor house or its grounds, the gremlins never get further than the entrance gate.~|~translationMissing
I'm missing the pressure gauge and a rubber tube. They've also taken my oil can, which I'm going to need to get this thing started again.~|~translationMissing
Change him back this instant!~|~translationMissing
What does this machine do?~|~translationMissing
Nothing at the moment... It's broken. It's meant to be a transmutation machine.~|~translationMissing
It has also spent time as a time travel machine, and a dramatic lightning generator, and a thing for generating monsters.~|~translationMissing
Is this your house?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm just one of the tenants. It belongs to the count who lives in the basement.~|~translationMissing
Yes, he's a chicken.~|~translationMissing
I know he's not exactly brave but I think you're being a bit harsh.~|~translationMissing
No no, he's been turned into an actual chicken by a mad scientist.~|~translationMissing
Eeeeeek!~|~translationMissing
My poor darling, why must these things happen to us.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm doing my best to turn him back.~|~translationMissing
Well be quick, I'm sure being a chicken can't be good for him.~|~translationMissing
Have you found anything yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't have any of them yet!~|~translationMissing
I need a rubber tube, a pressure gauge and a can of oil. Then your friend can stop being a chicken.~|~translationMissing
There seems to be a pressure gauge in here...~|~translationMissing
Something in the water bites you.~|~translationMissing
... and a lot of piranhas! I can't get the gauge out.~|~translationMissing
You poison the fish food.~|~translationMissing
You pour the poisoned fish food into the fountain.~|~translationMissing
The piranhas start eating the food...~|~translationMissing
... then die and float to the surface.~|~translationMissing
... and a lot of dead fish.~|~translationMissing
You get the pressure gauge from the fountain.~|~translationMissing
It's full of dead fish!~|~translationMissing
You pour the fish food into the fountain.~|~translationMissing
Now they seem hungrier than ever!~|~translationMissing
You dig through the compost...~|~translationMissing
... and find a small key.~|~translationMissing
I've only got the pressure gauge/oil can/rubber tube so far.~|~translationMissing
It's a good start, but I'll need my oil can and rubber tube too.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go and look for them.~|~translationMissing
I have everything!~|~translationMissing
You give the rubber tube, a pressure gauge, and a can of oil to the professor.~|~translationMissing
Oddenstein starts up the machine.~|~translationMissing
The machine hums and shakes.~|~translationMissing
Machine pouletmorphs Ernest back to human form!~|~translationMissing
Ernest~|~translationMissing
Thank you [sir/m'lady]. It was dreadfully irritating being a chicken. How can I ever thank you?~|~translationMissing
Well a cash reward is always nice...~|~translationMissing
Of course, of course.~|~translationMissing
Ernest hands you 300gp~|~translationMissing

Dimintheis~|~translationMissing
Hello. My name is Dimintheis, of the noble family Fitzharmon.~|~translationMissing
Why would a nobleman live in a dump like this?~|~translationMissing
The King has taken my estate from me until such time as I can show my family crest to him.~|~translationMissing
Why would he do that?~|~translationMissing
Well, there is a long standing rule of chivalry amongst the Varrockian aristocracy, where each noble family is in possession of a unique crest, which signifies the honour and lineage of the family. More than this~|~translationMissing
however, it also represents the lawful rights of each family to prove their ownership of their wealth and lands. If the family crest is lost, then the family's estate is handed over to the current monarch until the crest is~|~translationMissing
restored.~|~translationMissing
This dates back to the times when there was much in- fighting amongst the noble families and their clans, and was introduced as a way of reducing the bloodshed that was devestating the ranks of the ruling classes at that~|~translationMissing
time. When you captured a rival family's clan, you also captured their lands and wealth.~|~translationMissing
Continues from "So where is this crest?"~|~translationMissing
So where is this crest?~|~translationMissing
For many years I had assumed them all dead, as I had heard no word from them, but recently I heard word that my son Caleb is alive and well, and trying to earn his fortune as a great chef in the lands beyond White~|~translationMissing
Wolf Mountain, although I know not where.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I will help you.~|~translationMissing
I thank you greatly adventurer! Also... if you find Caleb... please... let him know his father still loves him...~|~translationMissing
I'm not interested in that adventure right now.~|~translationMissing
I realise it was a lot to ask of a stranger.~|~translationMissing
You're rich then? Can I have some money?~|~translationMissing
Gah! Lousy Beggar! Your sort is what's ruining this great land! Why don't you just go and get a job if you need the money so badly?~|~translationMissing
Hi, I am a bold adventurer.~|~translationMissing
An adventurer hmmm? How lucky. I may have an adventure for you. I desperately need my family crest returning to me. It is of utmost importance.~|~translationMissing
Why are you so desperate for it?~|~translationMissing
Continues above from "Well, there is a long standing rule"~|~translationMissing
Where did you say I could find your son Caleb again?~|~translationMissing
The only thing I have heard of my son Caleb is that he is trying to earn his fortune as a great chef in the lands beyond White Wolf Mountain.~|~translationMissing
Have you any news on my crest yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm still looking for it.~|~translationMissing
Caleb~|~translationMissing
Who are you? What are you after?~|~translationMissing
Are you Caleb Fitzharmon?~|~translationMissing
Why... yes I am, but I don't believe I know you... how did you know my name?~|~translationMissing
I have been sent by your father. He wishes the Fitzharmon Crest be restored.~|~translationMissing
Ah... well... hmmm... yes... I do have a piece of it anyway...~|~translationMissing
Uh... what happened to the rest of it?~|~translationMissing
Well... my brothers and I had a slight disagreement about it... we all wanted to be heir to my fathers' lands, and we each ended up with a piece of the crest.~|~translationMissing
None of us wanted to give up our rights to our brothers, so we didn't want to give up our pieces of the crest, but none of us wanted to face our father by~|~translationMissing
returning to him with an incomplete crest... We each went our seperate ways many years past, none of us seeing our father or willing to give up our fragments.~|~translationMissing
So do you know where I could find any of your brothers?~|~translationMissing
Well, we haven't really kept in touch... what with the dispute over the crest and all... I did hear from my brother Avan a while ago though.~|~translationMissing
He said he was on some kind of search for treasure, or gold, or something out in the desert. You might want to ask around there for him.~|~translationMissing
Avan always did have expensive tastes however. You may find he is not prepared to hand over his crest piece to you as easily as I have.~|~translationMissing
So can I have your bit?~|~translationMissing
Well, I am the oldest son, so by the rules of chivalry, I am most entitled to be rightful bearer of the crest.~|~translationMissing
It's not really much use without the other fragments is it though?~|~translationMissing
Well that is true... perhaps it is time to put my pride aside... I'll tell you what~|~translationMissing
I'm struggling to complete this fish salad of mine,~|~translationMissing
so if you will assist me in my search for the ingredients, then I will let you take my piece as reward for your assistance.~|~translationMissing
So what ingredients are you missing?~|~translationMissing
I require the following cooked fish~|~translationMissing
Swordfish, Bass, Tuna, Salmon and Shrimp.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I will get those.~|~translationMissing
You will? It would help me a lot!~|~translationMissing
Why don't you just give me the crest?~|~translationMissing
It's a valuable family heirloom. I think the least you can do is prove you're worthy of it before I hand it over.~|~translationMissing
Nothing, I will be on my way.~|~translationMissing
I see you are a chef, will you cook me anything?~|~translationMissing
I would, but I am very busy. I am trying to increase my reknown[sic] as one of the world's leading chefs by preparing a special and unique fish salad.~|~translationMissing
How is the fish collecting going?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all the fish in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I didn't manage to get them all yet...~|~translationMissing
Remember, I want the following cooked fish~|~translationMissing
Swordfish, Bass, Tuna, Salmon, and Shrimp.~|~translationMissing
If the player has all the fish in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Got them all with me.~|~translationMissing
You exchange the fish for Caleb's piece of the crest.~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much!~|~translationMissing
Where did you say I could find Avan again?~|~translationMissing
Last I heard he was on some stupid treasure hunt out in the desert somewhere. Your best bet is asking around there.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing getting the crest pieces?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the first piece~|~translationMissing
I am still working on it.~|~translationMissing
Then why are you wasting your time here?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the crest piece~|~translationMissing
I have lost the piece you gave me.~|~translationMissing
I have lost the piece you gave me...~|~translationMissing
I have some good news for you then. One of my customers found this on their travels and recognised it as mine and returned it to me here.~|~translationMissing
Caleb hands over his crest piece again.~|~translationMissing
I suggest you be less careless in the future. The crest is extremely valuable, and utterly irreplaceable.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. I'm just putting the finishing touches to my masterful salad.~|~translationMissing
Uh.. what happened to the rest of the crest?~|~translationMissing
Good luck with that then.~|~translationMissing
Luck? LUCK? With my cooking skill, I don't really need LUCK.~|~translationMissing
I've got it right here!~|~translationMissing
Excellent work! Please take it to my father immediately.~|~translationMissing
Silk trader~|~translationMissing
Do you want to buy any fine silks?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How much are they?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No. Silk doesn't suit me.~|~translationMissing
I'm in search of a man named Avan Fitzharmon.~|~translationMissing
Can't say as I've seen him... I'm sure if he's been to Al Kharid recently someone around here will have though.~|~translationMissing
Zeke~|~translationMissing
A thousand greetings, sir.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Could you sell me a dragon scimitar?~|~translationMissing
Karim~|~translationMissing
Would you like to buy a nice kebab? Only one gold.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I think I'll give it a miss.~|~translationMissing
Gem trader~|~translationMissing
Good day to you traveller. Would you be interested in buying some gems?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No thank you.~|~translationMissing
Fitzharmon eh? Hmmm.... If I'm not mistaken that's the family name of a member of the Varrockian nobility. You know, I HAVE seen someone of that~|~translationMissing
persuasion around here recently... Wearing a poncey yellow cape he was! Came in here all la-di-dah, high and mighty, asking for jewelry made~|~translationMissing
from 'perfect gold' - whatever that is - like 'normal' golds just not good enough for little lord fancy pants there! I told him to head to the desert~|~translationMissing
'Cos I know theres gold out there, in them there sand dunes... and if it's not up to his lordships high standards of 'gold perfection'...~|~translationMissing
Maybe we'll all get lucky and the scorpions will deal with him.~|~translationMissing
Why are you hanging around a in a scorpion pit?~|~translationMissing
Why are you lurking around a scorpion pit?~|~translationMissing
It's a good place to find gold...~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a man named Avan Fitzharmon~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a man... his name is Avan Fitzharmon.~|~translationMissing
Then you have found him. My name is Avan Fitzharmon.~|~translationMissing
You have a part of your family crest. I am on a quest to retrieve all of the fragmented pieces and restore the crest.~|~translationMissing
Ha! I suppose one of my worthless brothers has sent you on this quest then?~|~translationMissing
No, it was your father who has asked me to do this for him.~|~translationMissing
My... my father wishes this? Then that is a different matter. I will let you have my crest shard, adventurer, but you must first do something for me.~|~translationMissing
There is a certain lady I am trying to impress. As a man of noble birth, I can not give her just any old trinket to show my devotion. What I intend to give her,~|~translationMissing
is a golden ring, embedded with the finest precious red stone available, and a necklace to match this ring. The problem however for me, is that~|~translationMissing
not just any old gold will be suitable. I seek only the purest, the most high quality of gold - what I seek, if you will, is perfect gold.~|~translationMissing
None of the gold around here is even remotely suitable in terms of quality. I have searched far and wide for the perfect gold I desire, but have had no success so~|~translationMissing
in finding it I am afraid. If you can find me my perfect gold, make a ring and necklace from it, and add rubies to them, I will~|~translationMissing
gladly hand over my fragment of the family crest to you.~|~translationMissing
Can you give me any help on finding this 'perfect gold'?~|~translationMissing
I thought I had found a solid lead on its whereabouts when I heard of a dwarf who is an expert on gold who goes by the name of 'Boot'.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately he has apparently returned to his home, somewhere in the mountains, and I have no idea how to find him.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Avan~|~translationMissing
So how are you doing getting me my perfect gold jewelry?~|~translationMissing
I'm still after that 'perfect gold'.~|~translationMissing
I know how you feel... for such a long time I have searched and searched for the elusive perfect gold... I thought I had gotten a good lead on finding it~|~translationMissing
when I heard talk of a dwarven expert on gold named Boot some time back, but unfortunately for me, he has returned to his mountain home, which I cannot find.~|~translationMissing
Boot~|~translationMissing
Hello tall person.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'm in search of very high quality gold.~|~translationMissing
High quality gold eh? Hmmm... Well, the very best quality gold that I know of, is just East of the large city Ardougne, underground somewhere.~|~translationMissing
I don't believe it's exactly easy to get to though...~|~translationMissing
Hello short person~|~translationMissing
Hello short person.~|~translationMissing
Why are you called boot?~|~translationMissing
I'm called Boot, because when I was very young, I used to sleep, in a large boot.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, great, I didn't want your life story.~|~translationMissing
So how are you doing making me my perfect gold jewelry?~|~translationMissing
I have spoken to Boot the dwarf about the location of 'perfect gold' but haven't managed to make you your jewelry yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, I won't entrust you with my piece of the crest until you have brought me a necklace of perfect gold with a red precious stone, and a perfect gold ring to match.~|~translationMissing
I have the ring and necklace right here.~|~translationMissing
You hand Avan the perfect gold ring and necklace~|~translationMissing
These... these are exquisite! EXACTLY what I was searching for all of this time! Please, take my crest fragment!~|~translationMissing
Now, I suppose you will be wanting to find my brother Johnathon who is in possession of the final piece of the family's crest?~|~translationMissing
Well, the last I heard of my brother Johnathon, he was studying the magical arts, and trying to hunt some demon or other out in The Wilderness.~|~translationMissing
Unsurprisingly, I do not believe he is doing a particularly good job of things, and spends most of his time recovering from his injuries in~|~translationMissing
some tavern or other near the edge of The Wilderness. You'll probably find him still there.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Avan.~|~translationMissing
Where did you say I could find your brother Johnathon again?~|~translationMissing
Greetings again, adventurer. How are you doing on retrieving the crest pieces?~|~translationMissing
If the player has all the crest pieces~|~translationMissing
I hope you succeed for my father's sake.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost Avan's crest piece~|~translationMissing
I have lost the fragment you gave me...~|~translationMissing
I have a confession myself adventurer... I did not fully trust you with the actual part of my family's crest before, and gave you a worthless replica before...~|~translationMissing
I have assembled all of the pieces!~|~translationMissing
Very well done adventurer! Now please return it to my father!~|~translationMissing
Greetings. Would you happen to be Johnathon Fitzharmon?~|~translationMissing
Johnathon~|~translationMissing
That... I am...~|~translationMissing
I am here to retrieve your fragment of the Fitzharmon family crest.~|~translationMissing
The.. poison.. it is all.. too much... My head... will not... stop spinning...~|~translationMissing
Sweat is pouring down Johnathons' face.~|~translationMissing
What... what did that spider... DO to me? I... I feel so weak... I can hardly... think at all...~|~translationMissing
Ooooh... thank you... Wow! That's completely cured me!~|~translationMissing
How can I reward you?~|~translationMissing
I've come here for your piece of the Fitzharmon family crest.~|~translationMissing
You have? Unfortunately I don't have it any more... in my attempts to slay the fiendish Chronozon, the blood demon, I lost a lot of equipment in~|~translationMissing
our last battle when he bested me and forced me away from his den. He probably still has it now.~|~translationMissing
So is this Chronozon hard to defeat?~|~translationMissing
Well... you will have to be a skilled Mage to defeat him, and my powers are not good enough yet. You will need to hit him once with each of the four elemental spells of death~|~translationMissing
before he will be defeated.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Chronozon?~|~translationMissing
The fiend has made his lair in the Wilderness below the Obelisk of Air.~|~translationMissing
So how did you end up getting poisoned?~|~translationMissing
Those accursed poison spiders that surround the entrance to Chronozon's lair... I must have taken a nip from one of them as I attempted to make my escape.~|~translationMissing
(If the dialogue has gone through another option already~|~translationMissing
) I will be on my way now.~|~translationMissing
I will be on my way now.~|~translationMissing
My thanks for the assistance adventurer.~|~translationMissing
I'm trying to kill this demon Chronozon that you mentioned...~|~translationMissing
So, is this Chronozon hard to defeat?~|~translationMissing
Wish me luck.~|~translationMissing
Good luck. You'll need it.~|~translationMissing
I have your piece of the crest!~|~translationMissing
Well done! Now return it to my father!~|~translationMissing
I have retrieved your crest.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer... I can only thank you for your kindness, although the words are insufficient to express the gratitude I feel!~|~translationMissing
You are truly a hero in every sense, and perhaps your efforts can begin to patch the wounds that have torn this family apart...~|~translationMissing
I know not how I can adequately reward you for your efforts... although I do have these mystical gauntlets, a family heirloom that through some power unknown to me, have always returned to the head of the family~|~translationMissing
whenever lost, or if the owner has died. I will pledge these to you, and if you should lose them return to me, and they will be here.~|~translationMissing
They can also be granted extra powers. Take them to one of my sons, they should be able to imbue them with a skill for you.~|~translationMissing
I hear you brought the completed crest to my father. I must say, that was awfully impressive work.~|~translationMissing
I believe your father mentioned you would be able to improve these gauntlets for me...~|~translationMissing
Yes, that is correct. I can slightly alter these gauntlets to allow you some of my skill at preparing seafood by making them cooking gauntlets.~|~translationMissing
When you wear them you will burn lobsters, sharks and swordfish a lot less. It will be a permanent modification however, so make sure this is what you want.~|~translationMissing
Yes, please do that for me.~|~translationMissing
Caleb takes the gauntlets from you, pours some herbs and seasonings on them, bakes them on his range for a short time, then hands them back to you.~|~translationMissing
I'll see what your brothers have to offer first.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. Let me know if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
I have received word from my father of your assistance to our family in this matter. You have my thanks for restoring our honour.~|~translationMissing
Your father mentioned that you could improve these gauntlets in some way for me...~|~translationMissing
Indeed I can. In my long time searching for the 'perfect' gold I learned a lot about gold items. I can improve these gauntlets so that they provide more than normal~|~translationMissing
experience when smithing gold. I can easily modify these for you.~|~translationMissing
Select an option~|~translationMissing
That sounds good, improve them for me.~|~translationMissing
I think I'll check my other options with your brothers.~|~translationMissing
I think I'll check my other options with your brothers before committing myself.~|~translationMissing
If you feel you really must consort with the likes of them. I await your decision.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. My family now considers you a hero.~|~translationMissing
Your father tells me you can improve these gauntlets for me...~|~translationMissing
And right he is at that. Although my skill with Death Rune magiks was not great enough to defeat Chronozon, I am adequately skilled at Chaos Rune magiks.~|~translationMissing
If you give me your gauntlets I will bestow upon them some of my power, and make any bolt spells you wish to cast more effective.~|~translationMissing
That sounds good to me!~|~translationMissing
Johnathon takes your gauntlets from you, and begins a low chant over them. You see them begin to glow and sparkle, before he returns them to you.~|~translationMissing
I shall see what options your brothers can offer me first.~|~translationMissing
I doubt they will offer anything as useful as my magical boost, but as you wish.~|~translationMissing

4.1 Talking to Lady Servil after the quest~|~translationMissing
Door Guard~|~translationMissing
This area is restricted, leave now!~|~translationMissing
OUT! And don't come back.~|~translationMissing
Khazard Guard~|~translationMissing
I don't know you stranger. Get off our land.~|~translationMissing
Local~|~translationMissing
Hello stranger, are you new to these parts? You look lost.~|~translationMissing
I suppose you're here for the fight arena? There are some rich folk fighting tomorrow. Should be entertaining.~|~translationMissing
Hi there. Looks like you're in some trouble.~|~translationMissing
Lady Servil~|~translationMissing
The cart? That's the least of my problems. I've got to find my family...~|~translationMissing
Start the Fight Arena quest?~|~translationMissing
Your family? Can I help?~|~translationMissing
You'd be willing to?~|~translationMissing
Of course. Tell me what happened.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm Lady Servil. I was travelling to Ardougne with my husband, Justin, and son, Sammy, when our cart broke on some rocks.~|~translationMissing
General Khazard?~|~translationMissing
He's a menace! This entire area is under the control of him and his mercenary group, the Khazard Army. They prey on the weak and vulnerable, making them fight in that arena of theirs, all for entertainment!~|~translationMissing
That's horrible! How are they able to get away with it?~|~translationMissing
The authorities don't care. Khazard's men just pay them off if they ever come to investigate.~|~translationMissing
Well they won't stop me. I'm going to try my best to find your family.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. They'll be somewhere inside the arena. I'll be waiting here for you.~|~translationMissing
I hope you can, good luck.~|~translationMissing
Hello Lady Servil.~|~translationMissing
Brave traveller, please... bring back my family.~|~translationMissing
Who goes there?~|~translationMissing
Er... I... um...~|~translationMissing
I don't know who you are. Get out of my house stranger.~|~translationMissing
You open the chest.~|~translationMissing
If the player has neither helmet nor armour~|~translationMissing
You search the chest, and find the helmet and armour of a Khazard guard.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the armour~|~translationMissing
You search the chest, and find the armour of a Khazard guard.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the helmet~|~translationMissing
You search the chest, and find the helmet of a Khazard guard.~|~translationMissing
If the player has both helmt and armour~|~translationMissing
You search the chest, but find nothing.~|~translationMissing
Have you had any luck with freeing my family?~|~translationMissing
I've managed to get a guard's uniform, hopefully I can infiltrate the arena.~|~translationMissing
Please hurry.~|~translationMissing
Despicable thieving scum, that was good armour. Did you see anyone around here soldier?~|~translationMissing
Me? No, no one!~|~translationMissing
Hmmmm.~|~translationMissing
Can I help you stranger?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you're a guard as well. That's ok then. We don't like strangers around here.~|~translationMissing
I heard the Servil family are fighting soon. Should be very entertaining.~|~translationMissing
Hello stranger, are you new to these parts?~|~translationMissing
I suppose I am.~|~translationMissing
What's your business?~|~translationMissing
Just visiting friends in the cells.~|~translationMissing
Visiting, that's funny.~|~translationMissing
Only Khazard guards are allowed to see prisoners. Unless you know where to get some Khazard armour, you won't be visiting anyone.~|~translationMissing
Khazard barman~|~translationMissing
Hi, what can I get you? We have a range of quality brews.~|~translationMissing
I'll have a beer please.~|~translationMissing
That'll be two gold coins please.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 2 coins~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't have enough money with me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 2 coins~|~translationMissing
There you go, that's two gold coins.~|~translationMissing
Got any news?~|~translationMissing
If you want to see the action around here you should visit the famous Khazard fight arena. I've seen some grand battles in my time. Ogres, goblins, even dragons have fought there.~|~translationMissing
Although you have to feel sorry for some of the slaves sent in there.~|~translationMissing
I've never seen you around here before!~|~translationMissing
Long live General Khazard!~|~translationMissing
Erm.. yes.. soldier, I take it you're new around here?~|~translationMissing
You could say that.~|~translationMissing
Khazard died two hundred years ago. However his dark spirit remains in the form of the undead maniac General Khazard. Remember he is your master, always watching.~|~translationMissing
Got that newbie?~|~translationMissing
Undead, maniac, master. Got it, loud and clear.~|~translationMissing
This door appears to be locked.~|~translationMissing
Nice observation guard. You could have just asked to be let in like a normal person.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Khazard armour equipped~|~translationMissing
Do either of you know a Justin or Sammy Servil?~|~translationMissing
Joe~|~translationMissing
If we did, why would we tell you guard?~|~translationMissing
Kelvin~|~translationMissing
Until our last breath, our every action will be against Khazard. Never will we help you.~|~translationMissing
I spit on Khazard's grave, and all who do his bidding.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the Khazard armour equipped~|~translationMissing
I have heard of those of whom you speak. But I fear it may be too late.~|~translationMissing
It is said that Khazard has a personal vendetta against those two, their time is therefore short.~|~translationMissing
You're a brave [man/woman]. If the guards get you, you'll be in here next.~|~translationMissing
Do you know of a Justin or Sammy Servil in this arena?~|~translationMissing
Fightslave~|~translationMissing
Please leave me alone.~|~translationMissing
I've not met anybody in here by that name.~|~translationMissing
Do you know a Justin or Sammy Servil?~|~translationMissing
Hengrad~|~translationMissing
You're not a real guard. I've been in here long enough to know that. What's your business?~|~translationMissing
I've been sent to rescue Sir Servil and his son.~|~translationMissing
I've seen them in here, although they don't look up to much. My advice to you is to leave before you end up in a cell too.~|~translationMissing
If the nearby guards are alive~|~translationMissing
And where do you think you're going? Only General Khazard decides who fights in the arena. Get out of here.~|~translationMissing
If the nearby guards are dead~|~translationMissing
Erm.. yes.. quite right.~|~translationMissing
Have you come to laugh at the fight slaves? I used to really enjoy it, but after a while they become quite boring.~|~translationMissing
Now I just want a decent drink. Mind you, too much Khali brew and I'll fall asleep.~|~translationMissing
Bored, bored, bored. You'd think the slaves would be more entertaining. Selfish the lot of them.~|~translationMissing
I used to enjoy this job, but now all I want is a decent drink.~|~translationMissing
Sammy Servil~|~translationMissing
Please Sir, don't hurt me.~|~translationMissing
Sshh. This uniform is a disguise, I'm here to help. Where do they keep the keys?~|~translationMissing
Sshh. I'm here to help. Where do they keep the keys?~|~translationMissing
The guard always keeps hold of them.~|~translationMissing
Don't lose heart, I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
Lady Servil, I have managed to infiltrate General Khazard's arena.~|~translationMissing
And my family?~|~translationMissing
I'd like a Khali brew please.~|~translationMissing
That'll be five gold coins please.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 5 coins~|~translationMissing
There you go, that's five gold coins. I suggest lying down before you drink it. That way you have less distance to collapse.~|~translationMissing
Head Guard~|~translationMissing
What a boring day. You'd think the slaves would be more entertaining.~|~translationMissing
Do you still fancy a drink?~|~translationMissing
I really shouldn't...~|~translationMissing
Oh... okay then, but just the one.~|~translationMissing
File~|~translationMissing
77 detail.pngYou hand a bottle of Khali brew to the Head Guard and he quickly drinks it all.~|~translationMissing
That is some gooood stuff... yeah... wooh, yeah!~|~translationMissing
Are you alright?~|~translationMissing
Yeesshh! Oooh, maybe I sshould relax for a while.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. I'll look after the prisoners.~|~translationMissing
Yeesh... that shounds reasonable. Here, take the keysch. Any trouble, you give... you give 'em a good beating.~|~translationMissing
The Head Guard gives you some keys.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll keep them in line.~|~translationMissing
Hello, how's the job?~|~translationMissing
Please, leave me alone. I'm sure the walls never used to sway that much.~|~translationMissing
Hi, er.. I lost the keys.~|~translationMissing
What?!  You're foolish...~|~translationMissing
...and I'm drunk. Here, take my spare set.~|~translationMissing
Go away. Thish areash resh... restricted! We don't like strangersh, 'specially ones who sway. Oooh!~|~translationMissing
The gate is locked, but Sammy's not in there anyway.~|~translationMissing
Sammy look, I have the keys.~|~translationMissing
Wow! Please hurry and set me free.~|~translationMissing
We'll need to wait for the guards to change shift, but don't worry, you'll be out soon...~|~translationMissing
The player unlocks the door.~|~translationMissing
Alright, the coast is clear.~|~translationMissing
Now, let's get you out of here.~|~translationMissing
Not yet! We need to find my dad!~|~translationMissing
Sammy, wait!~|~translationMissing
Quick, help him!~|~translationMissing
Sammy, where's your father?~|~translationMissing
Quick, help him! That beast will kill him. He's too old to fight.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays of a Khazard Ogre exiting a cell toward Justin Servil.~|~translationMissing
General Khazard~|~translationMissing
What do you want guard? I'm a busy man.~|~translationMissing
Of course sir.~|~translationMissing
In the last two hundred years, I have survived all horrors imaginable. Now it is my turn to cover this land in darkness. One day you shall see, all will quake on hearing my name.~|~translationMissing
Now leave me.~|~translationMissing
Who dares enter my home? You? A feeble traveller?~|~translationMissing
Feeble?!~|~translationMissing
Get out!  Whoever let you in shall be severely punished for this.~|~translationMissing
Lady Servil sent me to rescue you and your son. Come on, we have to get out of here.~|~translationMissing
Justin Servil~|~translationMissing
I'm too old to fight. I'm afraid you'll have to kill that ogre by yourself.~|~translationMissing
Please don't go, you must help us. We'll never survive in here alone.~|~translationMissing
Where's your father Sammy?~|~translationMissing
I don't have time. I'm here to rescue Sir Servil and Sammy.~|~translationMissing
Lady Servil. I freed your son, however he has returned to the arena to help your husband.~|~translationMissing
Oh no, they won't stand a chance. Please go back and help.~|~translationMissing
Well, well, well, you seem to be in quite the rush. Do you have somewhere else to be?~|~translationMissing
Oh no...~|~translationMissing
General Khazard, I presume?~|~translationMissing
You presume correct. I must say, I sense a great air of defiance to you. Does my appearance not fill you with fear?~|~translationMissing
I've seen worse.~|~translationMissing
How arrogant. No matter though, you will come to learn.~|~translationMissing
They belong to nobody!~|~translationMissing
Ha! Well if their freedom is so valuable to you, how about a trade? Fight in my arena, and if you win, I'll let them go.~|~translationMissing
And what if I refuse your offer?~|~translationMissing
Well... I wasn't actually giving you a choice. Guards, take [him/her] to the cells.~|~translationMissing
The player is taken to a jail cell.~|~translationMissing
The General seems to have taken a liking to you. He'd normally kill imposters like you without a second thought.~|~translationMissing
You saved my life and my son's. I am eternally in your debt brave traveller.~|~translationMissing
Come on Sammy, we have to get out of here.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for saving my father.~|~translationMissing
Haha, well done, well done that was rather entertaining. I am the great General Khazard, and the two men you just 'saved' are my property.~|~translationMissing
I have come to demand the release of Sir Servil and his son.~|~translationMissing
Why would I give them up, those two men are my property now.~|~translationMissing
They belong to nobody.~|~translationMissing
Sammy is in the arena with his father now.~|~translationMissing
What did I do to deserve this?~|~translationMissing
Please help me.~|~translationMissing
You're not safe here, leave while you can.~|~translationMissing
I hope you're keeping busy.~|~translationMissing
General Khazard doesn't tolerate the lazy. If you're not keeping busy I'll practice my combat skills on your hide.~|~translationMissing
Get away, get away. One day I'll have my revenge, and I'll have all your heads.~|~translationMissing
Spare me your fake pity. I spit on Khazard's grave, and all who do his bidding.~|~translationMissing
You're not safe here traveller. Leave while you still can~|~translationMissing
You're a brave person. If the guards get you, you'll be in here next.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. So Khazard got his hands on you too?~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately so.~|~translationMissing
Well if you're lucky, you might last as long as me.~|~translationMissing
How long have you been here?~|~translationMissing
As long as I can remember. I was a child when his men kidnapped me. My whole life has been spent killing and fighting, all in the hope that one day I might escape.~|~translationMissing
Don't give up.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, friend.~|~translationMissing
Wait... sounds like the guard is coming. Looks like you'll be going back into the arena. Good luck, friend.~|~translationMissing
The guard walks up and unlocks the cell.~|~translationMissing
Right you, move it.~|~translationMissing
The player is brought into the arena.~|~translationMissing
Now watch closely, friends. I fear this may be where your protector dies.~|~translationMissing
From above you hear a voice.....  'Ladies and gentlemen! Let today's first fight between the outsider and everyone's favourite scorpion commence.'~|~translationMissing
The scorpion exits the cell and attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
So you're back for more are you? General Khazard will be pleased.~|~translationMissing
(The player is taken directly to the arena.)~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll get us out of here.~|~translationMissing
Thanks traveller. I'm sorry that you too are now a subject of this arena.~|~translationMissing
You've incurred the anger of Khazard yourself now. He won't let any of us go easily.~|~translationMissing
How dare you speak to me, you are a slave of this arena now.~|~translationMissing
It would be impolite to leave now. The General insists you stay a little longer.~|~translationMissing
Impressive, but now for a proper challenge. Time for my puppy. Bring on Bouncer!~|~translationMissing
From above you hear a voice.....  'Ladies and gentlemen! Today's second round of battle is between the outsider and Bouncer.'~|~translationMissing
Come on, we only have to fight a creature called bouncer now.~|~translationMissing
You may laugh, but the name of the General's 'pet' is feared by many in this land.~|~translationMissing
Hey you're the guy from the arena! How'd you get out!~|~translationMissing
I don't know how you managed to escape the arena, but you may not be as lucky next time. Get out of here while you can.~|~translationMissing
Bouncer! No!~|~translationMissing
You monster! You'll pay for what you've done!~|~translationMissing
I only did what you asked. I fought in your arena. Now let the Servils go.~|~translationMissing
Fine! I am not a coward who makes false promises. I have no need of them anyway. You on the other hand, won't be going anywhere.~|~translationMissing
Guard, escort the Servils out. I'll take great pleasure in dealing with this one myself!~|~translationMissing
Don't try to fight him! Just run!~|~translationMissing
General Khazard attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
What does Khazard want with us now?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, but I can't imagine he'll be happy with you now.~|~translationMissing
The agreement was that the Servils may leave if you won a few fights, and indeed they are now free to do so.~|~translationMissing
I don't know, but he won't be happy that you've killed his so called pet.~|~translationMissing
You can run, Khazard's interest is in me now.~|~translationMissing
My thanks, we'll be ok now. I suggest you run too, General Khazard is mighty and his anger fearsome.~|~translationMissing
You and your father should run, Khazard's interest is in me now.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to have gotten you into so much trouble. You should run as well, Khazard is too dangerous.~|~translationMissing
You killed my pet, and yet still you dare to speak to me?~|~translationMissing
You shall die for your insolence.~|~translationMissing
You're [him/her]. The one who murdered the General's pet. Leave this place at once!~|~translationMissing
You're the one who killed Bouncer.~|~translationMissing
Die traitor!~|~translationMissing
You've already rescued Sammy from the fight arena.~|~translationMissing
You're the guy who beat Bouncer, amazing!~|~translationMissing
That makes you a champion to many, but you'd better get out of here while you still can. General Khazard liked that brute.~|~translationMissing
Spectator~|~translationMissing
Hey, you're the one who beat Bouncer! Amazing!~|~translationMissing
Going somewhere?~|~translationMissing
But... I killed you!~|~translationMissing
Ha! Arrogant fool! You think you can kill me? I am General Khazard! My power is absolute!~|~translationMissing
You proved yourself in battle against me. That is something few can boast of. For that, you may leave. However, if you ever oppose me again, I won't hesitate to wipe you from existence!~|~translationMissing
Lady Servil.~|~translationMissing
You're alive, I thought Khazard's men had taken you.~|~translationMissing
My son and husband are safe and recovering at home. Without you they would certainly be dead. I am truly grateful for your service.~|~translationMissing
All I can offer in return is material wealth. Please take these coins as a sign of my gratitude.~|~translationMissing
You're alive! I feared General Khazard would have killed you!~|~translationMissing
He tried, but I was able to defeat him.~|~translationMissing
You killed General Khazard?~|~translationMissing
I thought I had at first, but it seems he is not that easy to kill.~|~translationMissing
Well, at least you're alive.~|~translationMissing
Now, you'll be pleased to know that my son and husband are safe and recovering at home. Without you they would certainly be dead. Thank you, for everything.~|~translationMissing
It's not a problem.~|~translationMissing
Please, take this payment. It's the least you deserve.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Lady Servil.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. My husband and son are resting while I wait for the cart fixer.~|~translationMissing
Well I hope it doesn't take too long.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure it won't. Thanks again for everything.~|~translationMissing

Hmmph. What do you want?~|~translationMissing
I was wondering what was down those stairs?~|~translationMissing
I was just wondering what was down those stairs?~|~translationMissing
You can't go down there!~|~translationMissing
I didn't want to anyway.~|~translationMissing
Good. Because you can't.~|~translationMissing
Because I don't want to.~|~translationMissing
Because you can't. So that's fine.~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Fine.~|~translationMissing
Absolutely.~|~translationMissing
Well then.~|~translationMissing
This is the home of the Mountain Dwarves. How would you like it if I wanted to take a shortcut through your home?~|~translationMissing
Ooh... is this a shortcut to somewhere?~|~translationMissing
Well, it is a lot easier to go this way to get past White Wolf Mountain than through those wolf filled passes.~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry, I hadn't realised it was private.~|~translationMissing
Well, it is.~|~translationMissing
If you were my friend I wouldn't mind it.~|~translationMissing
If you were my friend I wouldn't mind.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but I don't even know you.~|~translationMissing
Well, let's be friends!~|~translationMissing
I don't make friends easily. People need to earn my trust first.~|~translationMissing
And how am I meant to do that?~|~translationMissing
My, we are the persistent one aren't we?~|~translationMissing
Well, there's a certain gold artefact we're after. We dwarves are big fans of gold! This artefact is the first prize at the Hemenster fishing competition.~|~translationMissing
Fortunately we have acquired a pass to enter that competition...~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately Dwarves don't make good fishermen.~|~translationMissing
Fortunately I'm alright at fishing!~|~translationMissing
Okay. I entrust you with our competition pass. Don't forget to take some gold with you for the entrance fee.~|~translationMissing
Go to Hemenster and do us proud!~|~translationMissing
You got the Fishing pass!~|~translationMissing
You're a grumpy little man aren't you?~|~translationMissing

Do you have a brother?~|~translationMissing

Austri~|~translationMissing
Have you won yet?~|~translationMissing
Well don't give up! Maybe old Jack can give you a few tips.~|~translationMissing
I need another competition pass.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. It's a good job they sent us spares.~|~translationMissing
There you go. Try not to lose that one.~|~translationMissing
No, it takes preparation to win fishing competitions.~|~translationMissing
Maybe that's where we are going wrong when we try fishing?~|~translationMissing
Probably.~|~translationMissing
Maybe we should talk to that old Jack fella near the competition, everyone seemed to be ranting about him.~|~translationMissing
What are you sitting around here for?~|~translationMissing
Morris~|~translationMissing
I'm making sure only those with a competition pass enter the fishing contest.~|~translationMissing
I have one here.~|~translationMissing

Hey guy! Always nice to see a fresh face!~|~translationMissing
So you're the champ?~|~translationMissing
That's right, guy! Ain't nobody better at fishing round here than me! That's for sure!~|~translationMissing
Can I fish here instead of you?~|~translationMissing
Sorry guy! This is my lucky spot!~|~translationMissing
{tact|end}}~|~translationMissing
Do you have any tips for me?~|~translationMissing
Why would I help you? I wanna stay the best! I'm not givin' away my secrets like old Grampa Jack does!~|~translationMissing
Who's Grampa Jack?~|~translationMissing
You really have no clue do you! He won this competition four years in a row! He lives in the house just outside the gate.~|~translationMissing
Joshua~|~translationMissing
Yeah? What you want?~|~translationMissing
Um... nothing really...~|~translationMissing
Quit bugging me then, dude! I got me some fish to catch!~|~translationMissing
(End of dialogue)}~|~translationMissing
Nuh uh dude. Less talk, more fishing!~|~translationMissing
Dude! Why should I help you? You like, might beat me! I'm not giving away my secrets like that dude Grampa Jack does!~|~translationMissing
Who's Grampa Jack he says! He won this competition four years in a row! He lives in the house just outside the gate.~|~translationMissing
Grandpa Jack~|~translationMissing
Hello young man! Come to visit old Grandpa Jack? I can tell ye stories for sure. I used to be the best fisherman these parts have seen!~|~translationMissing
Tell me a story then.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, we decided to do a bit of fishing with our nets, I wasn't having the best of days turning up nothing but old boots and bits of seaweed. Then my net suddenly got really heavy!~|~translationMissing
To my amazement I'd caught this little chest thing!~|~translationMissing
Are you entering the fishing competition?~|~translationMissing
Ah... the Hemenster fishing competition...~|~translationMissing
I know all about that... I won that four years straight! I'm too old for that lark now though...~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you could give me any hints?~|~translationMissing
Well, you sometimes get these really big fish in the water just by the outflow pipes.~|~translationMissing
I think they're some kind of carp...~|~translationMissing
I used to get those from McGrubor's wood, north of here. Just dig around in the red vines up there but be careful of the guard dogs.~|~translationMissing
There's this weird creepy guy who says he's not a vampyre using that spot. He keeps winning too.~|~translationMissing
Ahh well, I'm sure you'll find something to put him off. After all, there must be a kitchen around here with some garlic in it, perhaps in Seers Village or Ardougne. If he's pretending to be a vampyre then he can pretend to be scared of garlic!~|~translationMissing
You're right! Thanks Jack!~|~translationMissing
That's less competition for me then.~|~translationMissing
Why you young whippersnapper! If I was twenty years younger I'd show you something that's for sure!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't have time now.~|~translationMissing
Sigh...~|~translationMissing
Young people - always in such a rush.~|~translationMissing
Can I buy one of your fishing rods?~|~translationMissing
But young man, you have your own. I'll not sell you mine when you already have one!~|~translationMissing
I've forgotten how to fish, can you remind me?~|~translationMissing
Of course! Let me see now...You'll need a rod and bait. You can fish with a net too, but not in the competition.~|~translationMissing
Ok... I think I can get those at Catherby.~|~translationMissing
Then simply find yourself a fishing spot, either in the competition near here, or wherever you can - I recommend net fishing in Catherby. Net or Lure the fish in the fishing spot by clicking on it and then be~|~translationMissing
patient...~|~translationMissing
It's that simple?~|~translationMissing
Yep! Go get em tiger.~|~translationMissing
Bonzo~|~translationMissing
Hey, you need to pay to enter the competition first! Only 5 gp entrance fee!~|~translationMissing
The player is force walked to Bonzo~|~translationMissing
Roll up, roll up!~|~translationMissing
Enter the great Hemenster fishing competition!~|~translationMissing
Only 5gp entrance fee!~|~translationMissing
I'll enter the competition please.~|~translationMissing
Ok, nearly everyone is in their place already. You fish in the spot by the willow tree, and the Sinister Stranger, you fish by the pipes.~|~translationMissing
If garlic was placed in the pipes~|~translationMissing
Arrgh! WHAT is that GHASTLY smell??? I think I will move over here instead...~|~translationMissing
Hmm. You'd better go and take the area by the pipes then.~|~translationMissing
Your fishing competition spot is now beside the pipes.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'll just watch the fun.~|~translationMissing
You pay Bonzo 5 coins to enter the competition.~|~translationMissing
Ok, we've got all the fishermen! It's time to roll!~|~translationMissing
You've already paid, you don't need to pay me again!~|~translationMissing
Ewww - it's a smelly sewage pipe.~|~translationMissing
You stash the garlic in the pipe.~|~translationMissing
So you're calling it quits here for now?~|~translationMissing
Yes I'll compete again another day.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll see you again.~|~translationMissing
Actually I'll go back and catch some more.~|~translationMissing
So how are you doing so far?~|~translationMissing
With a regular fish~|~translationMissing
I caught some fish! Here...~|~translationMissing
You hand over your catch.~|~translationMissing
And the winner is... The stranger in black!~|~translationMissing
With the giant carp~|~translationMissing
I have this big fish. Is it enough to win?~|~translationMissing
I have this big fish.~|~translationMissing
Is it enough to win?~|~translationMissing
Well, we'll just wait till time is up.~|~translationMissing
You wait[sic]~|~translationMissing
We have a new winner! The heroic-looking person who was fishing by the pipes has caught the biggest carp I've seen since Grandpa Jack used to compete!~|~translationMissing
You are given the Hemenster fishing trophy!~|~translationMissing
I think I might still be able to find a bigger fish.~|~translationMissing
Ok, good luck!~|~translationMissing
Hello champ!~|~translationMissing
If the fishing trophy has been lost~|~translationMissing
I don't feel like a champ...~|~translationMissing
Why not champ?~|~translationMissing
I lost my fishing trophy...~|~translationMissing
Is that all chump? Don't worry, I have a spare!~|~translationMissing
So any hints on how to fish?~|~translationMissing
I think I'll keep them to myself.~|~translationMissing
Yes I have!~|~translationMissing
Well done! That's brilliant! Do you have the trophy with you?~|~translationMissing
Yep, I have it right here!~|~translationMissing
Oh! It's even more shiny and gold than I thought possible...~|~translationMissing
You've done us proud. Thank you [lad/lass]. I think we can now trust you enough to let you in...~|~translationMissing
In where?~|~translationMissing
Why the tunnel of course! You may now come and go freely, avoiding the wolves and dangers of the cold, high mountain. You could even stop in for a beer or two!~|~translationMissing
Excellent. That will come in most handy.~|~translationMissing
Welcome, oh great Fishing Champion! Feel free to pop by and use our tunnel any time.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, I think I'll stop by for a beer one day.~|~translationMissing

Gertrude~|~translationMissing
Do I look okay? Those kids drive me crazy.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry. It's just that I've lost her.~|~translationMissing
Lost who?~|~translationMissing
Fluffs, poor Fluffs. She never hurt anyone.~|~translationMissing
Who's Fluffs?~|~translationMissing
My beloved feline friend Fluffs. She's been purring by my side for almost a decade. Please, could you go search for her while I look over the kids?~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose I could.~|~translationMissing
Really? Thank you so much! I really have no idea where she could be!~|~translationMissing
I think my sons, Shilop and Wilough, saw the cat last. They'll be out in the market place.~|~translationMissing
Alright then, I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Gertrude's Cat is started.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'm too busy to play pet rescue.~|~translationMissing
Well, okay then. I'll have to find someone else.~|~translationMissing
Hello Gertrude.~|~translationMissing
Have you seen my poor Fluffs?~|~translationMissing
What about Shilop?~|~translationMissing
No sign of him either.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm...strange, he should be at the market.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I've been looking for you.~|~translationMissing
Wilough~|~translationMissing
I didn't mean to take it! I just forgot to pay.~|~translationMissing
What? I'm trying to help your mum find Fluffs.~|~translationMissing
Ohh...well, in that case I might be able to help. Fluffs followed me to my secret play area, I haven't seen her since.~|~translationMissing
Where is this play area?~|~translationMissing
If I told you that, it wouldn't be a secret.~|~translationMissing
Tell me sonny, or I will hurt you.~|~translationMissing
W..wh..what?! Y..you wouldn't! A young lad like me! I'd have you behind bars before nightfall!~|~translationMissing
You decided it's best not to hurt the boy.~|~translationMissing
What will make you tell me?~|~translationMissing
Shilop~|~translationMissing
Well...now you ask, I am a bit short on cash.~|~translationMissing
10 coins.~|~translationMissing
10 coins?!~|~translationMissing
I'll handle this.~|~translationMissing
100 coins should cover it.~|~translationMissing
100 coins! Why should I pay you?~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't, but we won't help otherwise. We never liked that cat anyway, so what do you say?~|~translationMissing
I'm not paying you a penny.~|~translationMissing
Okay then, I'll find another way to make money.~|~translationMissing
Okay then, I'll pay.~|~translationMissing
You give the lad 100 coins.~|~translationMissing
There you go, now where did you see Fluffs??~|~translationMissing
I play at an abandoned lumber mill to the north east. Just beyond the Jolly Boar Inn. I saw Fluffs running around in there.~|~translationMissing
Well, you'll have to find the broken fence to get in. I'm sure you can manage that.~|~translationMissing
Well never mind, it's Fluffs' loss.~|~translationMissing
Well, never mind, it's Fluffs' loss.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure my mum will get over it.~|~translationMissing
Where did you say you saw Fluffs?~|~translationMissing
Weren't you listening? I saw the flea bag in the old lumber mill just north east of here. Just walk past the Jolly Boar Inn and you should find it.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, did you manage to find Shilop? I can't keep an eye on him for the life of me.~|~translationMissing
He does seem quite a handful.~|~translationMissing
You have no idea! Did he help at all?~|~translationMissing
I think so, I'm just going to look now.~|~translationMissing

The boy begins to jump around with his fists up. You decide it's best not to kill him just yet.~|~translationMissing
Hello. How's it going? Any luck?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've found Fluffs!~|~translationMissing
Well well, you are clever! Did you bring her back?~|~translationMissing
Well, that's the thing, she refuses to leave.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, oh dear! Maybe she's just hungry. She loves doogle sardines but I'm all out.~|~translationMissing
Doogle sardines?~|~translationMissing
Yes, raw sardines seasoned with doogle leaves. Unfortunately I've used all my doogle leaves, but you may find some in the woods out back.~|~translationMissing
You rub the doogle leaves all over the sardines.~|~translationMissing
The cat seems afraid to leave.In the distance you can hear kittens mewing...~|~translationMissing
You find a kitten! You carefully place it in your backpack.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Fluffs' kitten..)~|~translationMissing
Purr...~|~translationMissing
Fluffs has run off home with her offsping.~|~translationMissing
Hello Gertrude. Fluffs ran off with her kitten.~|~translationMissing
You're back! Thank you! Thank you! Fluffs just came back! I think she was just upset as she couldn't find her kitten.~|~translationMissing
If you hadn't found her kitten it would have died out there!~|~translationMissing
That's okay, I like to do my bit.~|~translationMissing
I don't know how to thank you. I have no real material possessions. I do have kittens! I can only really look after one.~|~translationMissing
Well, if it needs a home.~|~translationMissing
I would sell it to my cousin in West Ardougne. I hear there's a rat epidemic there. But it's too far.~|~translationMissing
Here you go, look after her and thank you again!~|~translationMissing
Oh by the way, the kitten can live in your backpack, but to make it grow you must take it out and feed and stroke it often.~|~translationMissing

Gordon~|~translationMissing
The name's Gordon. Good day to you.~|~translationMissing
It's a nice farm you've got here.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. We built it ourselves.~|~translationMissing
Really? So you haven't been here long?~|~translationMissing
Nope. Not too long ago you couldn't safely travel around these parts. Too many lizardmen. But then some Hosidius explorers discovered how fertile this land was.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hosidius made a deal with Lord Shayzien and the lizardmen were cleared out to make room for the Farming Guild.~|~translationMissing
When we heard, we decided to come up here and start up our own farm.~|~translationMissing
Need a hand with anything?~|~translationMissing
I think we're good. Thank you for the offer though.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the requirements to start the quest~|~translationMissing
Well actually, there is something we've been having a problem with.~|~translationMissing
Recently, some strange beast has been stealing our livestock at night. The soldiers are too busy dealing with the lizardmen to help, so we haven't been able to stop it.~|~translationMissing
You look like you know your way around a weapon. If you can kill the beast and bring me its head as proof, I'll ensure you are compensated for your trouble.~|~translationMissing
Start the Getting Ahead quest?~|~translationMissing
Bring back the head? I can do that. I'm good at killing things. Do you know where the beast is?~|~translationMissing
Well it can't be living too far from here, but I don't know exactly where. You might want to check with my wife, Mary. Perhaps she's seen something I haven't.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I'll return once I have the head of this beast!~|~translationMissing
Not something I can help with I'm afraid. Good luck though.~|~translationMissing
I understand. I'm sure someone else will be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Very nice. Well I hope it goes well for you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you friend. See you later.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. How are things?~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Not too bad, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Great to hear. All the best.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Any luck finding that beast?~|~translationMissing
I've been trying, but I haven't made much progress yet.~|~translationMissing
Well it can't be living too far from here. You might want to check with my wife, Mary. Perhaps she's seen something I haven't.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Are you Mary?~|~translationMissing
Mary~|~translationMissing
That's right. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm [player name]. Your husband told me that some beast has been causing you both trouble. I've agreed to kill it and bring back its head!~|~translationMissing
Ah, that's good to hear. We've already lost a lot of livestock to it.~|~translationMissing
Well fear not. I'm sure I'll make short work of it. I do have one issue, however.~|~translationMissing
I don't yet know where to find this beast. I was wondering if you'd seen anything?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. It only ever comes in the night, so we haven't been able to get a proper look at it.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. This is a problem.~|~translationMissing
Oh! I have an idea! If this beast ended up getting coated in flour, it wouldn't be hard for you to track it back to its home.~|~translationMissing
But how would I get it coated in flour?~|~translationMissing
Oh come on now! You're the adventurer here! Why don't you use your head?~|~translationMissing
Use my head? Wait... Did you just...?~|~translationMissing
I don't know what you mean.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. How goes the headhunt?~|~translationMissing
I'm still trying to come up with a way to cover the beast in flour.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm sure you'll think of something. Just remember to use your head.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Do you know anything about the beast causing trouble around here?~|~translationMissing
The farmers mentioned it. We haven't seen anything though. Our focus is on the lizardmen.~|~translationMissing
Surely you'd notice a big beast wondering around though?~|~translationMissing
The farmers said it came at night. We're not on shift then.~|~translationMissing
But then who's guarding the farm at night?~|~translationMissing
That's not our problem. We're just here to follow orders.~|~translationMissing
Fine. I'll find the beast myself.~|~translationMissing
Anything you need from me?~|~translationMissing
Just one question. You said this beast has been going for your livestock. Which animals has it been targeting?~|~translationMissing
It's mainly been going for the cattle. I fixed up a new gate which has kept it out the past couple of nights. Not sure how long it will hold though.~|~translationMissing
I see. Thanks for the information.~|~translationMissing
You pour some flour over the gate.~|~translationMissing
There we go. Anything that touches this gate will end up coated in flour. Now just to wait for the beast to come...~|~translationMissing
You head off for the night and come back the next day.~|~translationMissing
Looks like the beast tried to get in again. Now to see if the flour plan worked...~|~translationMissing
Your wife gave me a good idea to help track it down. I'll have its head soon enough!~|~translationMissing
Great to hear!~|~translationMissing
The flour idea worked great. Now I just need to find the beast's home.~|~translationMissing
Well keep your head up. I'm sure you'll manage it.~|~translationMissing
Ah... a headless beast. Can't really bring back the head if there isn't one. Let's hope Gordon is still happy to reward me...~|~translationMissing
I've run into a little issue. The beast is dead, but it didn't have a head.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. You should probably talk to Gordon about this.~|~translationMissing
The beast is dead!~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Do you have the head?~|~translationMissing
Well that's the thing...~|~translationMissing
Is there a problem?~|~translationMissing
So it didn't actually have a head.~|~translationMissing
Didn't have a head?~|~translationMissing
Nope.~|~translationMissing
Like... at all?~|~translationMissing
Not even a proper stump.~|~translationMissing
Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Can I get paid now?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but no. I agreed to pay you for a head and you don't have one.~|~translationMissing
Well actually I do have a head. Quite a good looking one in fact. It was the beast that didn't.~|~translationMissing
That's not what I meant. Look, it's nothing personal, but I can't be seen paying someone if they didn't do the job.~|~translationMissing
But I did the job... How am I meant to bring you the head of a beast with no head?~|~translationMissing
Maybe you killed the wrong beast? It doesn't make sense that a headless beast would be taking cattle. How would it eat them?~|~translationMissing
Well if you manage to get hold of the beast's head, let me know. Until then, I can't pay you.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Do you have the head of that beast yet?~|~translationMissing
No...~|~translationMissing
Well I can't pay you if you don't have the head.~|~translationMissing
You show the journal to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
I don't have the head of the beast. I do have proof it was headless though.~|~translationMissing
Proof? This doesn't seem like proof to me. Anyone could have written this. Maybe you wrote it?~|~translationMissing
You assume I can read and write.~|~translationMissing
Can you?~|~translationMissing
Well.. yes. I promise I didn't write this though.~|~translationMissing
Well you would say that. I'm sorry but I'm not having this. Come back when you have the head of the beast.~|~translationMissing
You show the bones to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
I don't have the head of the beast. I do have the bones though!~|~translationMissing
Bones? I don't want bones! I want the beast's head!~|~translationMissing
Have you considered that you might be being too picky?~|~translationMissing
Of course not! Besides, these bones could be from anywhere.~|~translationMissing
Eugh! Fine!~|~translationMissing
You show the ensouled head to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
I have bested the beast and I bring you its head as proof!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... I'm not so sure...~|~translationMissing
This is literally the head of a dead bear. What is wrong with you?~|~translationMissing
I can see this is the head of a bear! This beast we're dealing with is more than a mere bear though!~|~translationMissing
What? You said you'd never seen the beast! How do you know it wasn't just a bear?~|~translationMissing
We've dealt with bears before! This is clearly something more! Now, go and find the real beast!~|~translationMissing
You show the fake bearhead to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
What? But this is clearly just part of a costume!~|~translationMissing
Err... No it's not...~|~translationMissing
It's hollow!~|~translationMissing
Maybe it didn't have any brains.~|~translationMissing
The only thing without brains is you! Come back once you have the actual head!~|~translationMissing
I've run into a little issue. The beast is dead, but it didn't have a head. Your husband says he won't pay me until I bring him one.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. I'm afraid Gordon can be quite picky sometimes.~|~translationMissing
But what do I do now? I can't bring him a head if there isn't one.~|~translationMissing
Well, between you and me, Gordon is a good farmer but I wouldn't say he's a genius by any means. He also doesn't actually know what the beast looks like.~|~translationMissing
So I make him a fake head! Great idea!~|~translationMissing
That's the spirit! I've tried my hand at clay modelling in the past. You can make all sorts of things. Just get some soft clay and a knife and I'm sure you'll be able to make a lovely head.~|~translationMissing
I'll give it a shot!~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Any luck with that head?~|~translationMissing
Keep at it! I've tried my hand at clay modelling in the past. You can make all sorts of things. Just get some soft clay and a knife and I'm sure you'll be able to make a lovely head.~|~translationMissing
You sculpt the clay into the shape of a head.~|~translationMissing
It looks awful!~|~translationMissing
Still, maybe it will be enough to convince Gordon.~|~translationMissing
I've made a head out of clay.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! You should show it to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
You show the clay head to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
Its head? This is its head?~|~translationMissing
But this just looks like clay... It feels like clay...~|~translationMissing
As you talk to Gordon, part of the clay falls off.~|~translationMissing
It's falling apart... What creature is this?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes! A good question! A very good question! A good question in need of a good answer I'm sure!~|~translationMissing
Okay... So what is the answer?~|~translationMissing
Yes... well... This is the head of a... a claybear!~|~translationMissing
Claybear? There's no such thing!~|~translationMissing
They're quite rare around here.~|~translationMissing
Quite rare because they don't exist! I'm no fool, this is clearly a pretend head! It doesn't even have any fur!~|~translationMissing
Come back once you have the real head of the beast!~|~translationMissing
Do you have the head of that beast yet? Or do you just have more clay?~|~translationMissing
I don't have it yet.~|~translationMissing
No head, no pay.~|~translationMissing
I made a head out of clay. Gordon didn't buy it though.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. Keep trying. I'm sure with a few tweaks you can make a head that will convince him.~|~translationMissing
You attach the fur to the clay head.~|~translationMissing
It somehow looks even worse than before!~|~translationMissing
Gordon said it needed fur though. Maybe he'll be happy with this one.~|~translationMissing
I made a head out of clay. Gordon didn't buy it though, so I've now added some fur.~|~translationMissing
You show the fur head to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
I have bested the beast and I bring you its head as proof! For real this time!~|~translationMissing
Well there's fur this time. It does look like an actual head, I have to admit.~|~translationMissing
It really doesn't, but you let Gordon continue.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think this is the head of a beast.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! So about my payment?~|~translationMissing
Well hang on just a moment...~|~translationMissing
Where's the blood? If this is a fresh kill, the head should have blood on.~|~translationMissing
Ah... Yes... Well the thing about this head is that this is the head of a...~|~translationMissing
A... bloodbear?~|~translationMissing
Bloodbear? What's a bloodbear?~|~translationMissing
It's a rare type of bear. One that doesn't have any blood.~|~translationMissing
It's called a bloodbear but it doesn't have blood? Did a fool name it?~|~translationMissing
Well actually the one that named it is quite the intellectual... Very cool as well... not that I know them or anything.~|~translationMissing
You must take me for an idiot! This is some head you bought from a taxidermist or something. It's clearly not a fresh kill!~|~translationMissing
Come back once you have the real head!~|~translationMissing
Do you have the head of that beast yet? Or do you just have more fakes?~|~translationMissing
No head, no reward. Come back once you have it!~|~translationMissing
Gordon didn't buy the clay head so I tried adding some fur. He still wasn't convinced though.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm sure you're not far off. Keep it up!~|~translationMissing
That would be a terrible waste. Perhaps there's something better you can use.~|~translationMissing
You dye the fur head red.~|~translationMissing
Great! Now it looks bloody!~|~translationMissing
Well... it doesn't. It actually looks like someone tried to dye a fur covered clay monstrosity red.~|~translationMissing
Still, maybe Gordon won't notice...~|~translationMissing
Gordon didn't buy the clay head so I tried adding some fur. He still wasn't convinced so I've dyed it red to make it look bloody.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! I'm sure this will convince him. You should show him what you've got.~|~translationMissing
You show the bloody head to Gordon.~|~translationMissing
I have bested the beast and I bring you its head as proof... Again!~|~translationMissing
It's...~|~translationMissing
It's wonderful! This is clearly the head of the beast! Well done adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Hooray!~|~translationMissing
There's just one thing though...~|~translationMissing
Oh for the love of-~|~translationMissing
A head like this deserves a place of honour! My friend, please could you mount it in our home?~|~translationMissing
Eugh. Fine.~|~translationMissing
Have you mounted the head of the beast in our home yet?~|~translationMissing
Well let me know once you have and I'll give you your reward.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Gordon was happy with the head I made. In fact, he was so happy that he wants it mounting in your home.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. Well if it keeps him happy, I suppose. There should be a good spot near the stairs.~|~translationMissing
What a work of art! I've really outdone myself this time! I guess I should let Gordon know.~|~translationMissing
Well I have to say that mounted head looks awful.~|~translationMissing
Not to worry. If it keeps Gordon happy, so be it. Anyway, you should go and let him know it's all done.~|~translationMissing
Have you mounted the head of the beast yet?~|~translationMissing
That's great! I'd say it's about time for your reward. But first, let's have a look at this head...~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays in which Gordon cheers and laughs at his new mounted head. Meanwhile, Mary comes next to the player. Both wipe the sweat off their forehead, happy that Gordon has been fooled.~|~translationMissing
Congratulations, you've completed a quest~|~translationMissing

King Narnode Shareen~|~translationMissing
Welcome Traveller. I am King Narnode. It's nice to see an outsider.~|~translationMissing
Hi! It seems to be a very busy settlement.~|~translationMissing
For now.~|~translationMissing
You seem worried, what's up?~|~translationMissing
Traveller, can I speak to you in strictest confidence?~|~translationMissing
Of course sire.~|~translationMissing
Not here, follow me. Down here.~|~translationMissing
The player follows King Narnode down the trapdoor and a cutscene begins~|~translationMissing
I'll be off now.~|~translationMissing
Enjoy your stay with us. There are many things to see in my kingdom.~|~translationMissing
Down here.~|~translationMissing
So what is this place?~|~translationMissing
These, my friend, are the foundations of the stronghold.~|~translationMissing
They look like roots to me.~|~translationMissing
Not just any roots Traveller! These were created by gnome mages eons ago, since then they have grown to become a mighty stronghold!~|~translationMissing
Impressive. What exactly is the problem?~|~translationMissing
In the last two months our tree guardians have reported continuing deterioration of the Grand Tree's health. I've never seen this before! It could be the end for us all!~|~translationMissing
You mean the tree is ill?~|~translationMissing
In effect yes. Would you be willing to help us discover what is happening to the tree?~|~translationMissing
If the player is below level 50 combat~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended level of 50.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I don't want to get involved.~|~translationMissing
I understand Traveller. Please keep this to yourself.~|~translationMissing
I'll show you the way back up.~|~translationMissing
Up here.~|~translationMissing
The player follows King Narnode back up the trapdoor~|~translationMissing
I'd be happy to help!~|~translationMissing
Thank Guthix for your arrival! The first task is to find out what's killing the tree.~|~translationMissing
Do you have an idea?~|~translationMissing
My top tree guardian, Glough, believes it's human sabotage. I'm not so sure! The only way to know for sure is to talk to Hazelmere.~|~translationMissing
Who's Hazelmere?~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere is one of the mages that created the Grand Tree. He is the only one that has survived from that time. Take this bark sample to him, he will be able to help!~|~translationMissing
The king shows you a sample of bark.~|~translationMissing
The mage only talks in the old tongue, you'll need this.~|~translationMissing
The king shows you a translation book.~|~translationMissing
It's a translation book, you'll need it to translate what Hazelmere says. Do that carefully! His words are our only hope! You'll find his dwellings high upon a towering hill, on an island east of Yanille. I'll show you the way back up. Up here.~|~translationMissing
The king hands you the bark sample and the translation book.~|~translationMissing
The player follows King Narnode back up the trapdoor.~|~translationMissing
Traveller, any word from Hazelmere?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the bark sample~|~translationMissing
I've lost the bark sample.~|~translationMissing
Here's another sample, hang on to it this time!~|~translationMissing
The King gives you another bark sample.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the translation book~|~translationMissing
I've lost the translation book.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I have more.~|~translationMissing
The King gives you another translation book.~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere lives on an island just south of the Khazard Fight Arena, Give him the sample and translate his reply.~|~translationMissing
I just hope he can help us in our hour of need!~|~translationMissing
The mage starts to speak but all you hear is~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere~|~translationMissing
Blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah...blah!~|~translationMissing
You give the bark sample to Hazelmere. The mage carefully examines the sample.~|~translationMissing
Blah, blah...Daconia...blah, blah.~|~translationMissing
Can you write this down and I'll try and translate it?~|~translationMissing
Blah, blah?~|~translationMissing
You make a writing motion. The mages scribbles something down on a scroll.~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere has given you the scroll.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Hazelmere's scroll.)~|~translationMissing
Blah, blah....Daconia...blah, blah.~|~translationMissing
You still can't understand Hazelmere. The mage wrote it down for you on a scroll.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, Your highness.~|~translationMissing
Hello Traveller, did you speak to Hazelmere?~|~translationMissing
Yes! I managed to find him.~|~translationMissing
Do you understand what he said?~|~translationMissing
I think so!~|~translationMissing
So what did he say?~|~translationMissing
King Narnode must be stopped, he is a madman!~|~translationMissing
Praise be to the great Zamorak!~|~translationMissing
Do you have any bread? I do like bread.~|~translationMissing
The time has come to attack!~|~translationMissing
None of the above.~|~translationMissing
The tree is fine, you have nothing to fear.~|~translationMissing
You must come and see me!~|~translationMissing
The tree needs watering as there has been drought.~|~translationMissing
Grave danger lies ahead, only the bravest will linger.~|~translationMissing
Time is of the essence! We must move quickly.~|~translationMissing
(If the player chose the previous options correctly~|~translationMissing
) A man came to me with the King's seal.~|~translationMissing
A man came to me with the King's seal.~|~translationMissing
There is no need for haste, just send a runner.~|~translationMissing
There is no need for haste.~|~translationMissing
You must act now, or we will all die!~|~translationMissing
You must act now or we will all die!~|~translationMissing
(If the player chose the previous options incorrectly~|~translationMissing
) Time passes us by.~|~translationMissing
Time passes us by.~|~translationMissing
) I gave the man Daconia rocks.~|~translationMissing
I gave the man Daconia rocks.~|~translationMissing
You must use force!~|~translationMissing
Use a bucket of milk from a scared cow.~|~translationMissing
Use a bucket of milk from a sacred cow.~|~translationMissing
Take this banana to him, he will understand.~|~translationMissing
) Only Adamantite is any use.~|~translationMissing
Only Adamantite is any use.~|~translationMissing

All with be fine on the third night.~|~translationMissing
You must wait till the second night.~|~translationMissing
Nothing will help us now!~|~translationMissing
) The tree will die in five days!~|~translationMissing
The tree will die in five days!~|~translationMissing
) And Daconia rocks will kill the tree!~|~translationMissing
And Daconia rocks will kill the tree!~|~translationMissing
If the player chose the correct options~|~translationMissing
Of course! I should've known! Someone must've forged my royal seal. Hazelmere thought I sent him for the Daconia stones!~|~translationMissing
What are Daconia stones?~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere created the Daconia stones. They are a safety measure, in case the tree grew out of control. They're the only thing that can kill the tree.~|~translationMissing
This is terrible! The stones must be recovered!~|~translationMissing
Can I help?~|~translationMissing
First, I must warn the tree guardians. Please, could you tell the chief tree guardian, Glough. He lives in a tree house just in front of the Grand Tree.~|~translationMissing
If he's not there he will be at his girlfriend Anita's place. Meet me back here once you've told him.~|~translationMissing
Ok! I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
If the player chose the wrong options~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute! That doesn't sound like Hazelmere! Are you sure you translated correctly?~|~translationMissing
Erm...I think so.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry Traveller but this is no good. The translation must be perfect or the information's no use. Please come back when you know exactly what Hazelmere said.~|~translationMissing
No, I need to go back.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Bark sample.)~|~translationMissing
Time is of the essence Traveller!~|~translationMissing
Hello Traveller, did you speak to Glough?~|~translationMissing
OK. He lives just in front of the Grand Tree. Let me know when you?ve talked to him.~|~translationMissing
The gnome is munching on a worm hole.~|~translationMissing
Glough~|~translationMissing
Can I help human? Can't you see I'm eating?!~|~translationMissing
The gnome continues to eat.~|~translationMissing
The King asked me to inform you that the Daconia rocks have been taken!~|~translationMissing
Surely not!~|~translationMissing
I should've known! The humans are going to invade!~|~translationMissing
Never!~|~translationMissing
Your type can't be trusted! I'll take care of this! Go back to the King.~|~translationMissing
Hello there!~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't be here human!~|~translationMissing
The Gnome Stronghold is for gnomes alone!~|~translationMissing
We don't need your sort round here!~|~translationMissing
He doesn't seem very nice!~|~translationMissing
Hello, Your highness. Have you any news on the Daconia stones?~|~translationMissing
It's OK Traveller, thanks to Glough! He found a human sneaking around! He had three Daconia rocks on him!~|~translationMissing
Wow! That was quick!~|~translationMissing
Yes Glough really knows what he's doing. The human has been detained until we know who else is involved. Maybe Glough was right, maybe humans are invading!~|~translationMissing
I doubt it, can I speak to the prisoner?~|~translationMissing
Certainly. He's on the top level of the tree. Be careful, it's a long way down!~|~translationMissing
Hello Traveller. If you wish to talk to the prisoner go to the top of the tree, you'll find him there.~|~translationMissing
Tell me. Why would you want to kill the Grand Tree?~|~translationMissing
Don't tell me, you just happened to be caught carrying Daconia rocks!~|~translationMissing
All I know is that I did what I was asked.~|~translationMissing
Glough paid me to go to this gnome on a hill. I gave the gnome a seal and he gave me some Daconia rocks to give to Glough.~|~translationMissing
I've been doing it for weeks, this time though Glough locked me up here! I just don't understand it.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like Glough is hiding something.~|~translationMissing
I don't know what he's up to. If you want to find out, you'd better search his home.~|~translationMissing
OK. Thanks Charlie.~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer. Have you figured out what's going on?~|~translationMissing
No idea.~|~translationMissing
To get to the bottom of this you'll need to search Glough's home.~|~translationMissing
Hello Traveller. So, did you speak to the culprit?~|~translationMissing
Yes I did and something's not right!~|~translationMissing
The prisoner said he was paid by Glough to get the Daconia stones!~|~translationMissing
That's absurd! He's just trying to save himself!~|~translationMissing
Since Glough's wife died he's been a little strange. He would never wrongly imprison someone though! Now that the culprit is locked up we can relax. It's sad but I think Glough was right.~|~translationMissing
Humans are planning to invade and wipe out the tree gnomes!~|~translationMissing
Who knows? You may have to leave soon Traveller! I trust you but the local gnomes are getting paranoid.~|~translationMissing
Your highness! I'm concerned about Glough!~|~translationMissing
Why? Don't worry about him now the culprit has been caught. I'm sure Glough's resentment of humans will pass with time.~|~translationMissing
I'm not so sure.~|~translationMissing
If you're really concerned speak to him.~|~translationMissing
You've found Glough's Journal!~|~translationMissing
Glough! I don't know what you're up to but I know you paid Charlie to get those rocks!~|~translationMissing
You're a fool human! You have no idea what's going on.~|~translationMissing
I know the Grand Tree's dying! And I think you're part of the reason.~|~translationMissing
How dare you accuse me! I'm the head tree guardian! Guards! Guards!~|~translationMissing
(A gnome guard appears.)~|~translationMissing
Gnome guard~|~translationMissing
Come with me!~|~translationMissing
You are escorted by the guards and get locked up with Charlie~|~translationMissing
So they got you as well?~|~translationMissing
It's Glough! He's trying to cover something up.~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't tell you this adventurer. But if you want to get to the bottom of this you should go and talk to the Karamja Shipyard foreman.~|~translationMissing
Glough sent me to Karamja to meet him. I delivered a large amount of gold. For what? I don't know. He may be able to tell you what Glough's up to. That's if you can get out of here. You'll find him~|~translationMissing
in the Karamja Shipyard, east of Shilo Village. Be careful! If he discovers you're not working for Glough, there'll be trouble! The sea men use the password Ka-Lu-Min.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Charlie!~|~translationMissing
The King appears~|~translationMissing
Traveller please accept my apologies! Glough had no right to arrest you! I just think he's scared of humans. Let me get you out of there.~|~translationMissing
The player leaves the cell~|~translationMissing
I don't think you can trust Glough, Your highness. He seems to have an unnatural hatred for humans.~|~translationMissing
I know he can be a bit extreme at times. But he's the best tree guardian I have, he has made the gnomes paranoid about humans though.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid Glough has placed guards on the front gate to stop you escaping! Let my glider pilot fly you away until things calm down around here.~|~translationMissing
Well, OK.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry again Traveller!~|~translationMissing
Glough is looking for you! Leave on the glider now before it's too late!~|~translationMissing
I can't figure this out Charlie!~|~translationMissing
Captain Errdo~|~translationMissing
Hi. The king said that you need to leave?~|~translationMissing
Apparently humans are invading!~|~translationMissing
I find that hard to believe. I have lots of human friends.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand it either!~|~translationMissing
So where to?~|~translationMissing
Take me to Karamja please!~|~translationMissing
Take me to Karamja please.~|~translationMissing
Okay, you're the boss! Hold on tight, it'll be a rough ride.~|~translationMissing
You fly on the glider.~|~translationMissing
Not anywhere for now.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll be here for when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Sorry about that.~|~translationMissing
That turbulence over the Karamja Volcano was a bit unexpected, and the area round here isn't well suited for emergency landing.~|~translationMissing
Still! we're still alive that's the main thing. Are you okay?~|~translationMissing
I'm fine, I can't say the same for your glider!~|~translationMissing
I don't think I can fix this. Looks like we'll be heading back by foot. I might see if I can find Penwie while I'm here, I believe he's charting the area.~|~translationMissing
Where's the shipyard from here?~|~translationMissing
I think I saw some buildings on the coast east of here while we were crashing. I'd have a look there.~|~translationMissing
Take care adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Take care little man.~|~translationMissing
It's east of here. I thought I saw some buildings on the coast while we were crashing...~|~translationMissing
Shipyard worker~|~translationMissing
Hey you! What are you up to?~|~translationMissing
I'm trying to open the gate!~|~translationMissing
I can see that! Why?~|~translationMissing
I'm from the Ministry of Health and Safety.~|~translationMissing
Never 'erd of 'em.~|~translationMissing
You will respect my authority!~|~translationMissing
Get out of here before I give you a beating!~|~translationMissing
Glough sent me.~|~translationMissing
Hmm...really? What for?~|~translationMissing
You're wasting my time! Take me to your superior!~|~translationMissing
OK. Password.~|~translationMissing

If the player chose Ka-Lu-Min~|~translationMissing
Sorry to have kept you.~|~translationMissing
The player goes through the gate~|~translationMissing
If the player chose any other options~|~translationMissing
You have no idea!~|~translationMissing
The player is attacked by the Shipyard worker.~|~translationMissing
I'm just looking around.~|~translationMissing
This ain't a museum! Leave now!~|~translationMissing
I'll leave when I choose!~|~translationMissing
Well you're not on the list so you're not coming in. Go away.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll just stand here then until you let me in.~|~translationMissing
You do that!~|~translationMissing
I will!~|~translationMissing
Yeah?~|~translationMissing
Yeah!~|~translationMissing
So are you going to let me in then?~|~translationMissing
You bored yet?~|~translationMissing
No, I can stand here all day.~|~translationMissing
Alright you win. I'll find another way in.~|~translationMissing
No you won't.~|~translationMissing
Yes I will.~|~translationMissing
I'm not starting that again. Maybe if I ignore you you'll go away...~|~translationMissing
Quite a few ships you're building!~|~translationMissing
This is just the start! The completed fleet will be awesome!~|~translationMissing
No time to talk we've a fleet to build!~|~translationMissing
Hello matey!~|~translationMissing
How are you?~|~translationMissing
Tired!~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't work so hard!~|~translationMissing
Quite an impressive set up!~|~translationMissing
It needs to be. There's no other way to build a fleet of this size!~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I haven't seen you before.~|~translationMissing
I'm new!~|~translationMissing
Well it's hard work, but the pay is good.~|~translationMissing
Too busy to waste time gossiping!~|~translationMissing
Touchy!~|~translationMissing
Looks like hard work.~|~translationMissing
I like to keep busy.~|~translationMissing
So where are you sailing?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, just kidding!~|~translationMissing
Hello there, are you too lazy to work as well?~|~translationMissing
Something like that.~|~translationMissing
I'm just sun bathing!~|~translationMissing
What are you building?~|~translationMissing
Are you serious?~|~translationMissing
Of course not! You're obviously building a boat.~|~translationMissing
I'm getting tired of this!~|~translationMissing
Breaking my back for pennies! It's just not on!~|~translationMissing
Is that any way to talk to your new superior?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise!~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 14~|~translationMissing
What's wrong?!~|~translationMissing
I cut my finger!~|~translationMissing
Do you have a bandage?~|~translationMissing
That's ok, I'll use my shirt.~|~translationMissing
Dialogue 15~|~translationMissing
Well there's plenty of work to be done, so if you don't mind...~|~translationMissing
Of course. Sorry to have disturbed you.~|~translationMissing
Hello, are you in charge?~|~translationMissing
Foreman~|~translationMissing
That's right, and you are...?~|~translationMissing
Glough sent me to check on how you are doing.~|~translationMissing
Right. Glough sent a human?~|~translationMissing
His gnomes are busy.~|~translationMissing
Hmm...in that case we'd better go to my office. Follow me.~|~translationMissing
You follow the Foreman to his office~|~translationMissing
Tell me again why you're here.~|~translationMissing
Er...Glough sent me?~|~translationMissing
By the way how is Glough? Still with his wife?~|~translationMissing
Yes, they're getting on great.~|~translationMissing
Really? That's odd, considering she died last year. Die imposter!~|~translationMissing
The player is attacked by the Foreman.~|~translationMissing
Always arguing as usual!~|~translationMissing
Sadly his wife is no longer with us!~|~translationMissing
Right answer. I have to watch for imposters. What's Glough's favourite dish?~|~translationMissing
He loves tangled toads legs.~|~translationMissing
Our survey said.... Bzzzzzz! Wrong answer!~|~translationMissing
He loves worm holes.~|~translationMissing
OK. Just one more. What's the name of his new girlfriend?~|~translationMissing
Anita.~|~translationMissing
Well, well, you do know Glough. Sorry for the interrogation but I'm sure you understand.~|~translationMissing
Of course, security is paramount.~|~translationMissing
As you can see things are going well.~|~translationMissing
When I was asked to build a fleet large enough to invade Port Sarim and carry 300 gnome troops I said~|~translationMissing
'If anyone can, I can.'~|~translationMissing
That's a lot of troops!~|~translationMissing
True[sic] but if the gnomes are really going to take over RuneScape they'll need at least that.~|~translationMissing
Take over?~|~translationMissing
Of course, why else would Glough want 30 battleships? Between you and me I don't think he stands a chance.~|~translationMissing
No?~|~translationMissing
I mean, for the kind of battleships Glough's ordered I'll need tons and tons of limber! Still, if he says he can supply the wood I'm sure he can! Anyway, here's the order for the lumber.~|~translationMissing
The foreman has given you the lumber order.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Lumber order.)~|~translationMissing
OK. I'll head off and give this order to Glough.~|~translationMissing
Alia.~|~translationMissing
You almost had me fooled! Die imposter!~|~translationMissing
Elena.~|~translationMissing
He loves choc bombs.~|~translationMissing
The foreman is too busy to talk.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid we have orders not to let you in.~|~translationMissing
Orders from who?~|~translationMissing
The head tree guardian, he says you're a spy!~|~translationMissing
Glough!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry but you'll have to leave.~|~translationMissing
I can't believe they won't let me in!~|~translationMissing
Femi~|~translationMissing
I don't believe all this rubbish about an invasion. If mankind wanted to, they could have invaded before now.~|~translationMissing
I really need to see King Narnode. Could you help me sneak in?~|~translationMissing
Well, as you helped me I suppose I could. We'll have to be careful. If I get caught I'll be in the cage!~|~translationMissing
OK, what should I do?~|~translationMissing
Jump in the back of the cart. It's a food delivery, we should be fine.~|~translationMissing
Why should I help you, you wouldn?t help me!~|~translationMissing
Erm I know, but this is an emergency!~|~translationMissing
So was lifting that barrel! Tell you what, call it a round 1000 gold pieces.~|~translationMissing
1000 gold pieces!~|~translationMissing
That?s right, 1000 and I?ll sneak you in.~|~translationMissing
No chance!~|~translationMissing
Ok then, here you go.~|~translationMissing
OK then, here you go.~|~translationMissing
You give Femi 1000 coins.~|~translationMissing
Alright, jump in the back of the cart. It's a food delivery, we should be fine.~|~translationMissing
Femi sneaks the Player inside the Grand Tree~|~translationMissing
OK traveller, you'd better get going.~|~translationMissing
Thanks again!~|~translationMissing
That's OK, all the best.~|~translationMissing
Now, to get this lot to the Grand Tree!~|~translationMissing
No, I'm OK traveller. I can manage from here.~|~translationMissing
I'd better get going!~|~translationMissing
I know what you're up to Glough!~|~translationMissing
You have no idea human!~|~translationMissing
You may be able to make a fleet but the tree gnomes will never follow you into battle against humans.~|~translationMissing
So, you know more than I thought! The gnomes fear humanity more than any other race. I just need to give them a push in the right direction. There's nothing you can do traveller! Leave before it's too late!~|~translationMissing
King Narnode won't allow it!~|~translationMissing
The King's a fool and a coward! He'll bow to me! You'll soon be back in that cage!~|~translationMissing
King Nardone, I need to talk!~|~translationMissing
Traveller, what are you doing here? The stronghold has been put on full alert! It's not safe for you here!~|~translationMissing
Your highness, I believe Glough is killing the trees in order to make a mass fleet of warships!~|~translationMissing
That's an absurd accusation!~|~translationMissing
His hatred for humanity is stronger than you know!~|~translationMissing
That's enough Traveller, you sound as paranoid as him! Traveller please leave! It's bad enough having one human locked up.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing Charlie?~|~translationMissing
I've been better.~|~translationMissing
Glough has some plan to rule Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't put it past him, the Gnome's crazy!~|~translationMissing
I need some proof to convince the King.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... you could be in luck! Before Glough had me locked up I heard him mention that he'd left his chest key at his girlfriend's house. She lives just west of the toad swamp.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
Hello, your highness.~|~translationMissing
Please Traveller, if the gnomes see me talking to you they'll revolt against me.~|~translationMissing
Glough's scared the whole town, he expects the humans to attack any day. He's even begun to recruit hundreds of gnome soldiers.~|~translationMissing
Don't you understand he's creating his own army?!~|~translationMissing
Please Traveller, leave before it's too late!~|~translationMissing
I'm going to stop you, Glough!~|~translationMissing
You're becoming quite annoying traveller!~|~translationMissing
Glough is searching his pockets.~|~translationMissing
Where are that darn key?[sic]~|~translationMissing
Leave human, before I have you put in the cage!~|~translationMissing
Anita~|~translationMissing
Oh hello, I've seen you with the King.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm helping him with a problem.~|~translationMissing
You must know my boyfriend Glough then?~|~translationMissing
Could you do me a favour?~|~translationMissing
I suppose so.~|~translationMissing
Please give this key to Glough, he left it here last night.~|~translationMissing
Anita gives you a key.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Glough's key.)~|~translationMissing
Thanks a lot.~|~translationMissing
No... thank you!~|~translationMissing
No, I'm busy.~|~translationMissing
Have you taken that key to Glough yet?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm still carrying it around.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Please take it to Glough!~|~translationMissing
You have found a scroll!~|~translationMissing
You were right! I searched Glough's chest and found some invasion plans!~|~translationMissing
Go to the king and tell him! Finally you have proof. Surely King Narnode will believe you now and set me free!~|~translationMissing
Hold tight Charlie!~|~translationMissing
I'm not going anywhere!~|~translationMissing
Hi, Your highness, did you think about what I said?~|~translationMissing
Look, if you're right about Glough I would have him arrested but there's no reason for me to think he's lying.~|~translationMissing
Look, I found this at Glough's home!~|~translationMissing
You give the King the invasion plans.~|~translationMissing
If these are to be believed then this is terrible! But it's not proof, any one could have made these. Traveller, I understand your concern, I had guards search Glough's house but they found nothing suspicious, just these odd twigs. On the other hand, if Glough's right about the humans we will need an army of gnomes to protect ourselves. So I've decided to allow Glough to raise a mighty gnome army. The Grand Tree's still slowly dying, if it is human sabotage we must respond!~|~translationMissing
The King has given you some twigs lashed together.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 4 Twigs.)~|~translationMissing
Please Traveller, take my advice and leave!~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the twigs~|~translationMissing
I've lost those twigs you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Here take these, I don't see how it will help you though.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have enough inventory space~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Looks like you can't carry anymore. Put 4 things down and come back to me.~|~translationMissing
The prisoner is in no mood to talk.~|~translationMissing
You cannot put that on the pillar.~|~translationMissing
With a grinding of machinery, a trapdoor snaps open!~|~translationMissing
Cutscene plays~|~translationMissing
Anybody?~|~translationMissing
Glough?~|~translationMissing
You really are becoming a headache! Well, at least now you can die knowing you were right, it will save me having to hunt you down like all the other human filth of Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
You're crazy, Glough!~|~translationMissing
Bah! Well, soon you'll see, the gnomes are ready to fight, in three weeks this tree will be dead wood, in ten weeks it will be 30 battleships! Finally we will rid the world of the disease called humanity!~|~translationMissing
What makes you think I'll let you get away with it?~|~translationMissing
Fool... meet my little friend!~|~translationMissing
Screen fades~|~translationMissing
Pay attention when I'm talking to you!~|~translationMissing
The player is moved back to the platform.~|~translationMissing
Just die, human!~|~translationMissing
Your highness, it's true about Glough I tell you! He's planning to take over Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry Traveller but it's just not realistic. How could Glough, even with a gnome army, take over?~|~translationMissing
He plans to make a fleet of warships from the Grand Tree's wood!~|~translationMissing
That's enough Traveller! I've no time for make believe. The tree's still dying. I must get to the truth of this!~|~translationMissing
Mummy!~|~translationMissing
Traveller you're wounded! What happened?~|~translationMissing
It's Glough! He set a demon on me!~|~translationMissing
What?! Glough?! With a demon?!~|~translationMissing
Glough has a store of Daconia rocks further up the passage! He's been accessing the roots from a secret passage at his home.~|~translationMissing
Never! Not Glough! He's a good gnome at heart! Guard!~|~translationMissing
Sire!~|~translationMissing
Go and check out that passage!~|~translationMissing
We found Glough hiding under a horde of Daconia rocks!~|~translationMissing
That's what I've been trying to tell you! Glough's been fooling you!~|~translationMissing
I..I don't know what to say! How could I have been so blind?! Guard! Call off the military training! The humans are not attacking!~|~translationMissing
Yes sir!~|~translationMissing
You have my full apologies Traveller! And my gratitude! A reward will have to wait though, the tree is still dying! The guards are clearing Glough's rock supply now but there must be more Daconia hidden somewhere in the roots! Help us search, we have little time!~|~translationMissing
Traveller, have you managed to find the Daconia?~|~translationMissing
No sign of it so far.~|~translationMissing
The tree will still die if we don't find it! It could be anywhere!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry Your highness! We'll find it!~|~translationMissing
You search the root but don't find anything.~|~translationMissing
You've found a Daconia rock!~|~translationMissing
Is this it?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Excellent, well done!~|~translationMissing
You give the King the Daconia rock.~|~translationMissing
It's incredible, the tree's health is improving already! I don't know what to say, we owe you so much! To think Glough had me fooled all along!~|~translationMissing
All that matters now is that humans and gnomes can live together in peace!~|~translationMissing
I'll drink to that! From now on I vow to make this stronghold a welcoming place for all! I'll grant you access to all our facilities.~|~translationMissing
Thanks! I think!~|~translationMissing
It should make your stay here easier. You can use the spirit tree to transport yourself, as well as the gnome glider. I also give you access to our mine.~|~translationMissing
Mine?~|~translationMissing
Very few know of the secret mine under the Grand Tree. If you push on the roots just to my north they will separate and let you pass.~|~translationMissing
Strange!~|~translationMissing
That's magic trees for you! All the best Traveller and thanks again!~|~translationMissing
You too, Your highness!~|~translationMissing

Hello there. My name's [player name].~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the requirements to begin the quest~|~translationMissing
Sylas~|~translationMissing
Ahhh, good day young adventurer. I can't stop to talk right now I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
You do not meet all of the requirements to start the Grim Tales quest.~|~translationMissing
Ahhh, good day young adventurer. A good day indeed! Sylas is the name. It is lucky for you that you met me.~|~translationMissing
Why, what do you mean?~|~translationMissing
Well it just so happens, [player name], that I have something you simply must have!~|~translationMissing
Beans, my friend! Beans!~|~translationMissing
Why would I want beans exactly? I mean, beans are good, of course, but I'm pretty sure I can get them anywhere.~|~translationMissing
Ahhh, but not beans like this, young [player name]. No, not at all! These are 'magic' beans.~|~translationMissing
Ok then. So what do they do exactly?~|~translationMissing
An excellent question! Excellent indeed! What do they do? What do they do? Yes, yes! A most excellent question!~|~translationMissing
O...kay. So, are you going to tell me what they do?~|~translationMissing
You must plant them in the ground. Water them well. Then the magic will work, it's...er...magic...yes! Plant them, [player name].~|~translationMissing
So, can I have the beans then?~|~translationMissing
All in good time, my excitable young friend. All in good time.~|~translationMissing
Few things in this world are free, you know, and beans - magical or otherwise - are no exception!~|~translationMissing
So, how much gold do you want for the beans, if I decide to buy them?~|~translationMissing
Ah, well you see now I am a collector of rare and unusual trinkets and objects. Not much in value, but very important to me.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I see. Ok then.~|~translationMissing
Right, well I think that for magic beans, I will need something magical back and I know of just the right items that would help my collection.~|~translationMissing
Ok, so if I get these items, you will trade them for the beans. Is that right?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Excellent! You do catch on quick! I can see that we will become great business partners indeed. Oh, yes. Yes indeed! Hmm-ha! Yes.~|~translationMissing
What items do you need me to find then - assuming I still want those beans of course. Not that I do, but I might.~|~translationMissing
Well, there are two. The first item should be nice and simple for you to get for me. I want a griffin feather. Now, this is not just any feather, this one is special.~|~translationMissing
What's so special about it?~|~translationMissing
There is a griffin named Grimgnash who lives in a nest on one of the peaks of White Wolf Mountain. It is one of his feathers that I want.~|~translationMissing
But although this task should be easy, you must be careful [player name]. Grimgnash has a very bad temper and even sharper claws!~|~translationMissing
Ok, thanks for the advice.~|~translationMissing
What do you need the feather for?~|~translationMissing
I told you, [player name]. It is for my collection of magical items and trinkets, weird and wonderful thereof.~|~translationMissing
Thereof?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I was quite happy with that word. I think it went rather well in that last sentence, don't you?~|~translationMissing
I guess. If you say so.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Excellent! Yes. Now...er...was there anything else?~|~translationMissing
How do I find Grimgnash again?~|~translationMissing
When he's not chewing on some poor soul's bones or raining terror on an unsuspecting village, he can be found in his nest, atop White Wolf Mountain.~|~translationMissing
Excuse me...say what now? He chews people's bones? I thought you said this was an easy task?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I daresay he has to eat sometimes. But I don't think he'd take too much fancy for you. Not much meat on you at all. Oh dear me, no!~|~translationMissing
You know, I'm not sure that was even a compliment.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure it was meant to be! Don't worry, [player name], you'll be fine. Now was there anything else?~|~translationMissing
What's the other item I need to find?~|~translationMissing
Right, well, the second item is this. I know of a dwarf named Rupert the Beard who has a very fine dwarven helmet. I'd like you to see if you can obtain it for me.~|~translationMissing
Ok. Where can I find him?~|~translationMissing
Travel north-east from here and between the Goblin Village and Ice Mountain you will find Rupert in a tower there.~|~translationMissing
Ok, that seems simple enough. I'll get the helmet for you as well.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Yes, yes. Now was there anything else?~|~translationMissing
Do you have any weird items in your collection?~|~translationMissing
Haha! Weird items? Oh yes. Yes indeed! Yes. Many items. Many items. Yes.~|~translationMissing
Umm...I see. Well, can you tell me about any of them?~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Well let's see now. I have the second eye of a mutant two-eyed cyclops. That was a rare find indeed! And at a tidy price too!~|~translationMissing
A two-eyed cyclops? Uh...wouldn't that be a normal giant perhaps?~|~translationMissing
Whatever do you mean? How many mutant two-eyed cyclops do you think there are out there? Not many, I'd wager!~|~translationMissing
Umm...no, I guess not. Well, what else do you have?~|~translationMissing
Ah, well I'm glad you asked. My most prized possession to date~|~translationMissing
Through my connections, I managed to acquire a horn-less Unicorn!~|~translationMissing
Really? That's amazing! A unicorn without a horn?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Yes indeed! Indeed yes! And I'm very proud of it, too! It was an exceptionally lucky find, I must say!~|~translationMissing
I expect so. Well, on to other things for now then, I guess.~|~translationMissing
Of course. Was there anything else you wanted?~|~translationMissing
I should be off, I think.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, excellent! Best of luck then, my friend. I'll be right here waiting for you to return.~|~translationMissing
I have a question or two I would like to ask you.~|~translationMissing
Of course. Go ahead.~|~translationMissing
Uh...hello?~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash~|~translationMissing
Human? Human come to Grimgnash? Grimgnash pleased! Grimgnash hungry!~|~translationMissing
No, wait! I didn't come to be eaten!~|~translationMissing
What human come for then? Grimgnash tired and hungry. Be quick, human. Answer Grimgnash before Grimgnash eats your legs!~|~translationMissing
Uh...uh...~|~translationMissing
I heard you were a great and mighty Griffin!~|~translationMissing
I have come for your magic feather!~|~translationMissing
Quests? Quests? Human morsel wants a quest from Grimgnash? Human think Grimgnash is drunken dwarf or lazy ork? Grimgnash not gives quests!~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash tired and hungry and will eat little bite-size human!~|~translationMissing
(Grimgnash attacks the player, and does a large amount of damage.)~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash lashes out at you and you recoil backwards in pain. You must be more careful what you say. Grimgnash could eat you at any moment!~|~translationMissing
Look what I've got!~|~translationMissing
Grargk! Grimgnash not care for stupid human things! Grimgnash hungry!~|~translationMissing
Human toothpick dares to approach Grimgnash again after what human just say? Why human disturb Grimgnash? Human have death wish?~|~translationMissing
No, wait! I was wondering if perhaps I could help you at all. You said you couldn't sleep. Is there anything I can do?~|~translationMissing
Human help Grimgnash sleep? This good. Grimgnash let human help.~|~translationMissing
Ok. What can I do?~|~translationMissing
Hmm. When Grimgnash little grifflet, Grimgnash's mother-griff used to tell bedtime story to Grimgnash. That always help Grimgnash sleep.~|~translationMissing
So you want me to tell you a bed-time story, is that right?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Grimgnash like stories!~|~translationMissing
Right, well I'm sure that shouldn't be too hard. I know lots of stories!~|~translationMissing
Good. Grimgnash like stories. Lots of death and fire and destruction! Grimgnash ready!~|~translationMissing
Death and fire?...ok then. Let me see...~|~translationMissing
And make story good. Otherwise, if no sleep, Grimgnash more hungry!~|~translationMissing
Ok!~|~translationMissing
There once was a graveyard filled with undead.~|~translationMissing
Graveyard is good place for story. Is undeads all horrible and ugly?~|~translationMissing
Uh...yes...yes I suppose they could be.~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash like this story. Go on. Go on.~|~translationMissing
There lived a skeleton named Grimgnash.~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash? That Grimgnash's name! Not stupid skeleton's name! How skeleton have Grimgnash's name?~|~translationMissing
Oh, wait! Sorry! I got that bit wrong there. I was thinking of your name. My mistake! What I meant was...~|~translationMissing
There lived a skeleton named Skullrot.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes! Skullrot. That great name! Grimgnash like that name. Maybe Grimgnash call himself Grimgnash Skullrotter? What human think?~|~translationMissing
I...er..I'm sure nobody would disagree with you.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Grimgnash Skullrotter. Grimgnash like that very much. What happens next? This good story...for human.~|~translationMissing
Skullrot was happy!~|~translationMissing
Why Skullrot happy?~|~translationMissing
Uh...he was happy because...er...he was dead?~|~translationMissing
Because he dead? That stupid. How someone happy if they dead? Stupid human tell stupid story! Raaargh!~|~translationMissing
Skullrot was sad!~|~translationMissing
Sad? Why he sad?~|~translationMissing
Uh...I guess because he was...er...dead?~|~translationMissing
What human mean, dead? How Skullrot dead if he alive and walking around? That stupid!~|~translationMissing
No, I don't think you understand what a skeleton is, exactly...~|~translationMissing
Now human call Grimgnash stupid? Human is stupid! Human is tasty morsel! Grimgnash likes tasty morsels!~|~translationMissing
Argh...!~|~translationMissing
Skullrot was angry!~|~translationMissing
What Skullrot angry about?~|~translationMissing
Uh...he was angry because...er...he had a headache?~|~translationMissing
A headache? That daft idea. Skeletons have nothing in head to ache. Grimgnash think human is making story up. Not real story like mother-griff used to tell.~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash just eat human instead!~|~translationMissing
Oww!~|~translationMissing
Skullrot was insane!~|~translationMissing
Yes, insane! Grimgnash like that word! Grimgnash mother always say Grimgnash's daddy insane. Grimgnash's daddy eat own claws. Grimgnash laughed.~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash cackles in what you can only imagine must be a griffin's laugh.~|~translationMissing
That's...lovely. Uh...shall I continue?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Grimgnash liking this story now! Go on!~|~translationMissing
Ok, then. So Skullrot was completely insane. He was off his rocker. One noodle short of a bowl of spaghetti. Not quite all there.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, he was out haunting his graveyard one day when he came across a small gnome.~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash not like gnomes. They stringy and chewy and they not have much meat for Grimgnash's belly.~|~translationMissing
Uh, I'm sorry to hear that. Anyway, this poor gnome had somehow got his foot stuck under a fallen gravestone.~|~translationMissing
Skullrot lifted the gravestone off.~|~translationMissing
And the gnome ran away as quick as his little feet could carry him.~|~translationMissing
What?! Gnome snack gets away? That dumb. How Skullrot eat? Stupid human can't tell good story!~|~translationMissing
No, wait...!~|~translationMissing
Skullrot left the gnome there to die.~|~translationMissing
So the gnome, thinking this was his chance, found a log to lever the stone off his foot and he scarpered away quickly.~|~translationMissing
What?! Gnome snack gets away? That stupid. That not good story! Grimgnash only feel more hungry now!~|~translationMissing
No, wait, I got it wrong! Wait...!~|~translationMissing
Skullrot laughed at the gnome.~|~translationMissing
In fact, he laughed so hard that he fell backwards into an empty grave and was never seen again. The end.~|~translationMissing
Graah! That good stor...wait. What happen to gnome?~|~translationMissing
Eh? Oh, uh...well without Skullrot there he was able to get himself free again and ran away, vowing never to return to the graveyard ever again.~|~translationMissing
What?! Little bite-size gnome runs away? That not good ending! Gnome should be mashed by something like...something like Grimgnash! Stupid human get eaten now!~|~translationMissing
Skullrot hungrily grabbed the gnome's hair.~|~translationMissing
Skullrot wrenched the gnome out with one hand, pulling hard on his hair. The poor gnome's foot snapped out of the gravestone and went crack as his foot dislocated!~|~translationMissing
Raahahaha! Stupid gnome! Serves gnome right for being stringy and chewy! What happen next?~|~translationMissing
Well, the poor gnome - Nobby was his name - was in terrible pain and fear as to what would happen to him next.~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash not care what gnome's name is. Grimgnash not give food names. Does human call a carrot Jasper or something? Tell rest of story!~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok. Anyway, the gnome was in awful pain, so Skullrot took him back to his home in his grave where he...~|~translationMissing
Locked him in an iron cage.~|~translationMissing
Luckily, the bars were built for a human sized person and so the gnome quickly slipped through them and ran - painfully - out the door.~|~translationMissing
The gnome headed straight out the graveyard, glad to still be alive and never wanting to return.~|~translationMissing
Stringy gnome gets away? Stupid human make Grimgnash more hungry with story like that!~|~translationMissing
No, stop! Arrgh...!~|~translationMissing
Put him into a pot for dinner.~|~translationMissing
Skullrot was making a stew and had decided that the gnome would taste wonderful in it.~|~translationMissing
Ah! Grimgnash likes gnome stew. Just like Grimgnash used to eat at home. Mmmm!~|~translationMissing
However, Skullrot had filled the pot up too much, and so while the skeleton's back was turned, the gnome swam to the edge of the pot and up, over the side.~|~translationMissing
With a little shout of glee, the gnome hopped on one leg straight out of the door and fled as fast as his little foot could hop him!~|~translationMissing
Gnome gets away? What kind of story that? Grimgnash think he eat human now!~|~translationMissing
Started to strangle the poor gnome.~|~translationMissing
The gnome struggled with the cold boney fingers that were trying to end his life until he managed to pry himself free!~|~translationMissing
Ohhh! This getting good! Grimgnash like this. (Yawn!) Grimgnash feels sleepy.~|~translationMissing
Ok, it was all the little gnome could do to crawl painfully across the floor away from Skullrot, who was busy getting a pot to put the gnome in.~|~translationMissing
Then, when all seemed lost for the little gnome, he suddenly saw something that might save his little life!~|~translationMissing
Grargh! What? What? What little gnome see? He must not escape! Grimgnash hungry to think of it!~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok! Don't worry, we're almost done.~|~translationMissing
Grmmm. Good. Grimgnash getting sleepy...(yawn).~|~translationMissing
It looks like Grimgnash is almost asleep. You better think about the best way to finish this story!~|~translationMissing
So, then. The gnome looked up and he saw what might be his best chance to get out alive!~|~translationMissing
He saw a hole he could just fit through.~|~translationMissing
As he crawled forward two yellow slitted eyes appeared in the gloom before him. He froze in fear!~|~translationMissing
Skullrot did not get his dinner that night, but something else...something much worse...did. The end.~|~translationMissing
So what did you think, Grimgnash?~|~translationMissing
Zzzzzz....zzzz....zzz...~|~translationMissing
It looks like that did the trick. Grimgnash is snoring loudly! You better grab the feather and get out before he wakes up again!~|~translationMissing
He saw a big axe leaning on the wall.~|~translationMissing
He crawled painfully, oh so painfully over to the axe. He could use it to kill Skullrot.~|~translationMissing
As he grasped the axe he realised it was a lot heavier than it looked! In fact much heavier indeed! He couldn't hold it or stop it falling off the wall!~|~translationMissing
SCHNUNK!!~|~translationMissing
What happened? Human tell Grimgnash!~|~translationMissing
As the axe fell, the poor gnome could not get out of the way in time and the razor sharp blade fell CRACK! And it killed him instantly.~|~translationMissing
And so Skullrot was pleased to find that he had a nice dinner for that night and sat down for a big supper! The end.~|~translationMissing
What did you think, Grimgnash?~|~translationMissing
He saw some bones lying in the corner.~|~translationMissing
He quickly remembered that if he buried them he could get his prayer up and so might be able to cast a heal spell on his legs!~|~translationMissing
He dragged his painful body over to the bones and buried them all - there was quite a large pile - in the floor.~|~translationMissing
All of a sudden, he remembered a good spell to heal himself from his injuries. He started to recite the prayer quickly.~|~translationMissing
Just then, a huge zombie appeared out of nowhere and mumbled something about his bones being disturbed! The zombie crunched his fist down on the gnome's head.~|~translationMissing
The gnome cried out in terror and realised that all was lost! He could not get away now!~|~translationMissing
And so, Skullrot decided to invite the zombie to dinner as he never usually had guests.~|~translationMissing
Then the two of them laughed and joked merrily throughout the night with their stomachs full of a hearty dinner! The end.~|~translationMissing
He saw a small sandwich on the floor.~|~translationMissing
He pulled himself over to it. In his desperation he thought to himself, there's a sandwich here. A sandwich! Maybe the skeleton will eat that instead?~|~translationMissing
He quickly grasped the sandwich in his little hands. Strangely, in his panic-stricken state, he noticed that it was long and tubular shaped.~|~translationMissing
What an odd thing to notice, he thought. And then all of a sudden he heard an almighty voice boom out of nowhere!~|~translationMissing
'SANDWICHES!!!'~|~translationMissing
'Oi!', said the voice. 'I didn't say you could take that!' And with that, there was an almighty crunch on his little gnome head, and that was the last thing he felt.~|~translationMissing
Skullrot sat down for the night and had a lovely big dinner, followed by many baguette sandwiches. Not triangle ones, no, no! The end.~|~translationMissing
Locked the gnome in the attic to die.~|~translationMissing
Fortunately for the gnome, Skullrot forgot that he lived in a grave, so he didn't have an attic. Instead the gnome was locked outside.~|~translationMissing
The gnome quickly limped away, glad to still be alive.~|~translationMissing
Gnome gets away? What kind of story that? Stupid human make Grimgnash more hungry!~|~translationMissing
There lived a skeleton named Boney.~|~translationMissing
Boney? That stupid name for skeleton. Of course he boney. Human think Grimgnash stupid? Human make fun of Grimgnash? Grimgnash think human look better in Grimgnash's belly!~|~translationMissing
No wait...I...~|~translationMissing
There lived a skeleton named Harry.~|~translationMissing
What kind of name Harry for skeleton? That stupid name. How many skeletons called Harry you meet?~|~translationMissing
Uh, I've not really...~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash think Grimgnash just eat you instead of story!~|~translationMissing
There once was a king named Roland.~|~translationMissing
Gaah! This sound like boring story! Maybe Grimgnash eat you instead, yes?~|~translationMissing
What? No! Wait, I got that bit wrong! Sorry. What I meant was...~|~translationMissing
There once was a princess named Esmerelda.~|~translationMissing
Urgh! Grimgnash hate princesses. They bones and no meat. Need eating more, Grimgnash thinks. Speak of eating, Grimgnash maybe eat you instead of story!~|~translationMissing
There once was a little bunny called Flumper.~|~translationMissing
Bunnies? Bunnies!? Grimgnash hate this story! This story smell worse than Grimgnash's feet. Stupid human tell awful story! Make Grimgnash more hungry than ever!~|~translationMissing
You quickly take a feather while Grimgnash is sleeping.~|~translationMissing
If the player already owns a Griffin feather~|~translationMissing
You already have a feather from Grimgnash's nest. You don't need another one.~|~translationMissing
Grimgnash looks like he's sleeping nicely. It would probably be dangerous to your health to try and wake him up now!~|~translationMissing
Hi, Sylas. I have Grimgnash's feather for you.~|~translationMissing
Ah! Good work. Let me take that from you then.~|~translationMissing
I still need you to find Rupert the Beard's Helmet forme.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll get that next.~|~translationMissing
This door appears to be securely locked.~|~translationMissing
Miazrqa~|~translationMissing
Excuse me. You can't go in there.~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello.~|~translationMissing
Who am I? Why, how impertinent! I am a princess and I will be spoken to like one. Now be off with you. I have no time for scruffy adventurers like yourself!~|~translationMissing
Uh...ok. Never mind then!~|~translationMissing
I'm pretty sure I don't want that.~|~translationMissing
Well it's mine and you can't have it anyway. So there!~|~translationMissing
Drain pipe~|~translationMissing
I say! Where on Gielinor did that voice come from?~|~translationMissing
Uh...hello there! Can you hear me?~|~translationMissing
Why yes. Yes I can. My word. Is that...is that one ofthe gods? Guthix perhaps? Saradomin?~|~translationMissing
No, no. I'm not either of them.~|~translationMissing
Egad! You're not...Zamorak...are you? I mean,uh...begging your pardon of course, my Lord. Nooffence intended!~|~translationMissing
Ha ha! No, I'm speaking to you through the pipe here!I'm at the bottom of your tower.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Oh I see! Oh, yes. How clever! Remarkable idea!However did you think of that? Good show, old bean!~|~translationMissing
Rupert the Beard. At your service, old fruit.~|~translationMissing
Rupert the Beard?~|~translationMissing
Yes, old ogleroot! On account of my wonderfully longbearded chin, you see.~|~translationMissing
So what are you doing up there exactly? And howcome you talk so strangely?~|~translationMissing
What am I doing? Well, I guess I'm stuck in a matterof speaking. Dear me, yes! I'm stuck. And I speak inthe King's speech, I'll have you know.~|~translationMissing
Really? Which king?~|~translationMissing
Which K...? Why, THE King old spud! THE King!Only one worth mentioning in my opinion.~|~translationMissing
Hey, you're not related to Sir Tiffy by any chance areyou?~|~translationMissing
What? That namby pamby nincompoop? Not on yournelly! More fluff in the ears than sense, that man!~|~translationMissing
I see. Well is there anything I can do to help you upthere?~|~translationMissing
By Guthix, I know how you can help me!~|~translationMissing
Sure. What can I do?~|~translationMissing
Hey, what's that noise over there? Is someone there?~|~translationMissing
Ye gods! We can't talk like this anymore. You need tofind a way up to speak to me privately, old boot!~|~translationMissing
Why? I don't understand what's going on!~|~translationMissing
That woman is a princess. She's holding me prisoner. Ifshe sees you I will be in even more trouble and whoknows what she'll do to you!~|~translationMissing
Right! Let me have a think, then!~|~translationMissing
You there! Young scrub! Was that you making all that noise back there? Well? Speak up now.~|~translationMissing
Noise? What noise? I didn't hear any noise.~|~translationMissing
Well I distinctly heard voices at least! In any case, keep away from my tower.~|~translationMissing
I am a princess. I don't have to be nice.~|~translationMissing
I thought princesses were usually kind and loving and graceful?~|~translationMissing
Ha! This isn't a fairytale, you know. This is rea...well, it's life!~|~translationMissing
I see. Well I think I had better go then.~|~translationMissing
Yes, and stay away from my dwar...uh...tower!~|~translationMissing
I think I might have an idea!~|~translationMissing
Jolly good show, old bean! What do you suggest?~|~translationMissing
You could try and climb down.~|~translationMissing
Climb down? What what what? It's miles! People are like little ants from up here...oh wait...no that's just a line of ants on the wall.~|~translationMissing
It's really not that far.~|~translationMissing
Tish, posh and nonsense! You and your gangly long legs might be fine, but we dwarves are of shorter, stockier breed, old toothbrush!~|~translationMissing
So you won't try it then?~|~translationMissing
Indeed, definitely and most indubitably not! Think of something else!~|~translationMissing
I could try and climb up.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, a worthy endeavour I would say. Possibly with its merits. Yes, indeed. Now how will you get up here?~|~translationMissing
I could try and climb the walls.~|~translationMissing
I don't know if that would work, old trousers. These walls are made from very smooth and flat stone. Excellent workmanship. Simply excellent.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you're able to admire the architecture, but you're still stuck up there!~|~translationMissing
Right you are, old pockets! Keep thinking! These are excellent ideas you're having!~|~translationMissing
Is there anything up there that can help?~|~translationMissing
Not really, old spoon. There's not much up here except for me and my beard. Ha ha!~|~translationMissing
Wait! That's it!~|~translationMissing
What's it, old banana?~|~translationMissing
I can't believe I'm going to say this, but...Rupert, Rupert, let down your beard!~|~translationMissing
Eh? Let down my beard? Have you lost it down there, old chum? Going a bit loopy?~|~translationMissing
No, I mean hang your beard down over the tower and I'll climb up it, ok?~|~translationMissing
Ah ha ha! Excellent idea, old tomato! Here it comes then!~|~translationMissing
Rupert's beard is let down.~|~translationMissing
I can fly!~|~translationMissing
By Guthix and Saradomin, that's astounding! You are an absolute marvel! Can you really fly?~|~translationMissing
Well...er...no, sorry, I made that last bit up!~|~translationMissing
I see. Not very sporting in the circumstances, was it?~|~translationMissing
Umm, no I guess not. Sorry about that.~|~translationMissing
There must be something down here that might help.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I have no idea! It's a long way down as I said, so I can't see much from way up here!~|~translationMissing
I'm telling you, it's really not that high.~|~translationMissing
Lies! Lies! Now can you see anything down there that might help, old chicken?~|~translationMissing
Not really, no.~|~translationMissing
I could ask the princess!~|~translationMissing
Hang on, old underpants!...you're going to ask the princess to help you climb up this wall to see her prisoner.~|~translationMissing
You know, on second thought maybe that's not such a good idea after all.~|~translationMissing
No, indeed. Indeed, no.~|~translationMissing
Well, I could try and ask her to let you out, perhaps? You know, get her to listen to reason.~|~translationMissing
Reason, eh? Hmmm. Well you could give that a try.~|~translationMissing
I could try speaking to the princess.~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try, old socks! What would you say?~|~translationMissing
Well, I could try and get her to listen to reason, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Reason, eh? Hmmm. Well, you could give that a try.~|~translationMissing
I could kill the princess for you!~|~translationMissing
What? Kill the princess?~|~translationMissing
Sure, she doesn't look so tough!~|~translationMissing
What ever has gotten into your head, old war wound? Kill the princess. No, no, no. We don't do that sort of thing round here.~|~translationMissing
But she's kidnapped you. Surely that makes her evil?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes of course. In a manner of speaking, yes. But...but that still doesn't give us the right to go around lopping people's heads off because they're not very nice!~|~translationMissing
No, there must be another way! Keep thinking!~|~translationMissing
Ok...~|~translationMissing
But it would have been fun though, wouldn't it? Haha!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm.~|~translationMissing
She would never have seen it coming! Blam!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I get the idea. Now be a sport and think of a better idea!~|~translationMissing
Right!~|~translationMissing
Pardon me...?~|~translationMissing
Yes? Please make it quick, I am waiting for someone.~|~translationMissing
Oh, really? Who are you waiting for? Maybe I've met them?~|~translationMissing
You think so? Ha! Although you'd most likely remember if you had met this person. If you must know, I am waiting for a relative of mine to arrive.~|~translationMissing
Oh, okay. Can I ask you something?~|~translationMissing
I notice you have a dwarf in the tower here. I was wondering why he is locked in there?~|~translationMissing
You are a nosy young person! Well, if you must know, he's in there because I have caught him for someone.~|~translationMissing
Oh, who's that then?~|~translationMissing
I am not at liberty to say. In any case, this dwarf was caught spying and snooping and that sort of thing is not taken lightly.~|~translationMissing
But he seems like a very nice person to me. A bit odd perhaps, but couldn't you let him go?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't think so. I will be nicely rewarded for catching him.~|~translationMissing
Oh go on. Please?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well as you asked nicely. Ok then.~|~translationMissing
No! Now please leave. You're annoying me!~|~translationMissing
Hello? Rupert?~|~translationMissing
Eh? What? Oh! You don't have to use that anymore, old spoon! Climb up to speak to me!~|~translationMissing
Climb up how?~|~translationMissing
Up my beard of course! It was your idea after all, old spinach.~|~translationMissing
You nimbly scale up the beard to the top of the tower.~|~translationMissing
Rupert the Beard~|~translationMissing
Aha! You made it. Well done, old sausage!~|~translationMissing
Yes, it was quite a climb, but you have a very strong beard.~|~translationMissing
Indeed I do. Indeed I do.~|~translationMissing
So, what can I help you with?~|~translationMissing
Ah! Straight to the point, eh, what? Good show old carrot, good show. Now let me explain.~|~translationMissing
I'm in a bit of a fix right now. You see, the princess down there has this horrible relative who happens to be a witch.~|~translationMissing
A witch? Let me guess, would this witch be her evil stepmother?~|~translationMissing
Stepmother? Ho! Good lord, no. No king in his right mind would marry a hag like that! No, this is her evil second-cousin, twice-removed.~|~translationMissing
I see. Go on.~|~translationMissing
Right, well a young gnome friend of mine by the name of Winkin recently disappeared whilst delivering ogleroots to the market in Draynor.~|~translationMissing
Really? What happened to him?~|~translationMissing
I don't know exactly, but someone told me he was last seen talking to a witch before he disappeared.~|~translationMissing
Ok, so how can I help?~|~translationMissing
My investigations brought me to our friend the princess down there, old pinata. She's related to this witch, as I mentioned. I was...you know...showing a bit of interest in her to get her to give me information.~|~translationMissing
And then what happened?~|~translationMissing
She invited me back to her 'tower', saying she would tell me all I wanted to know, and then as I walked in the door she slammed it shut behind me.~|~translationMissing
Goodness me! How rude!~|~translationMissing
Yes, indeed! Rude indeed! Then, as I was hammering on the door I heard a hissing sound and smelt something strange. The next thing I remember is waking up to find my armour gone!~|~translationMissing
That wench must have taken it!~|~translationMissing
Ok, let me go and talk to her for you, then.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Good show, old spice! Off you go then.~|~translationMissing
Ahh, you're back. Have you spoken to the princess yet, old mushroom?~|~translationMissing
Oh, no I haven't had a chance yet. I'll be back when I have.~|~translationMissing
Right you are then, old chestnut.~|~translationMissing
The trapdoor is locked. You can hear a clinking sound as you pull on it. You figure it must be connected to a mechanism of some sort through the tower.~|~translationMissing
You nimbly scale back down the beard to the floor below.~|~translationMissing
Pardon me, your ladyship.~|~translationMissing
Ah! What nice manners. It's so hard to find decently mannered young people these days. My name is Princess Miazrqa.~|~translationMissing
Pleased to meet you, Princess Miarz... er... Mizaz... Miquipzi... Marzipan?~|~translationMissing
Miazrqa. With a silent Q.~|~translationMissing
That's an unusual name. Where is it from?~|~translationMissing
My birth certificate.Now. how[sic] can I be of help?~|~translationMissing
I see there is an ambarrassed-looking dwarf...~|~translationMissing
I see there is an embarrassed-looking dwarf in the tower there.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. I'm waiting for him to be collected by someone.~|~translationMissing
Your first-cousin, once removed?~|~translationMissing
No. You shouldn't guess answers like that. It's not very becoming. She is my second-cousin, twice removed and she is also a very powerful witch who could turn you into something nasty!~|~translationMissing
Gosh! Sorry, please continue.~|~translationMissing
Now as I was saying, my second-cousin, twice-removed is coming to collect the dwarf. She will find out why he's been snooping around. She has most...persuasive methods.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's actually why I came to speak with you. I was wondering if you couldn't let Rupert go? He's a nice fellow and I can't think he'd have done anything wrong.~|~translationMissing
Ha! That won't matter to my cousin. She values her privacy above all else, you see.~|~translationMissing
Surely there must be something that will change your mind? Is there anything you want?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm...well I suppose there is something you can do for me that might make me change my mind.~|~translationMissing
Ok, what's that?~|~translationMissing
I was at my second-cousin's house just the other day when I suddenly dropped a very valuable pendant that I was wearing. The chain must have broken, you see.~|~translationMissing
Ok, go on.~|~translationMissing
Well, no sooner had it touched the ground when all of a sudden a mouse ran out from a hole in the wall. It took my pendant in its teeth and disappeared back inside its hole.~|~translationMissing
As I'm sure you will believe, I was most upset as the pendant was a gift from my mother. I simply must get it back somehow.~|~translationMissing
So you would like me to find it for you?~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes please! It means so much to me. If you are able to find the pendant for me, I will let your dwarf friend go.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I will find it for you.~|~translationMissing
Where is your second-cousin's house?~|~translationMissing
It's not far to the west of here, in Taverley village. It has a beautiful long garden - you can't miss it!~|~translationMissing
Hey! I do know that house! I rescued some little kid's ball from there!~|~translationMissing
That was you? Oh, my cousin was absolutely furious when she found out about that! She went on about it for ages and even made her hair turn a quite ghastly green colour!~|~translationMissing
Well I suggest you be extra careful when you look for my pendant then.~|~translationMissing
What does your pendant look like?~|~translationMissing
It's a lovely gold pendant.~|~translationMissing
Is it particularly valuable?~|~translationMissing
Only to me really. It's not worth much and isn't magical, but it has a lot of sentimental value. It was my mother's pendant. She gave it to me on my tenth birthday.~|~translationMissing
Where are you the princess of exactly?~|~translationMissing
I am the daughter of a great and powerful king. In a land far, far away.~|~translationMissing
How far, exactly?~|~translationMissing
Far, far.~|~translationMissing
Oh. What's the place called?~|~translationMissing
Asgarnia.~|~translationMissing
Asgarnia? Aren't we in Asgarnia?~|~translationMissing
Well...yes. I suppose, but that doesn't mean it's not far, far away from somewhere else.~|~translationMissing
Uh...I see.~|~translationMissing
I am the great niece of King Vallance himself.~|~translationMissing
How impressive!~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is, isn't it? Now was there anything else?~|~translationMissing
I need a key for the house.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't own the Door key~|~translationMissing
Of course. You may have one of my spare keys.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Door key.)~|~translationMissing
Thanks very much.~|~translationMissing
Don't be silly. You have one already in your bag. Goodness me, how ever will you find my pendant with a memory like that?~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Good luck with finding my pendant.~|~translationMissing
Your second-cousin, once removed?~|~translationMissing
Your first-cousin, twice removed?~|~translationMissing
Your second-cousin, twice removed?~|~translationMissing
I just have another question before I look for your pendant.~|~translationMissing
If you must, but you are wasting time.~|~translationMissing
Hi Rupert.~|~translationMissing
Rupert~|~translationMissing
Ah! Welcome back, old curtains! How did it go with the old princess down there? Did she agree to let me out?~|~translationMissing
Sort of. She's asked me to do something for her first.~|~translationMissing
Oh, right. What was it then, old parrot?~|~translationMissing
I have to find a gold pendant of hers that she lost in that witch's house in Taverley.~|~translationMissing
By all the gods! You have to go in there? You must be careful, [player name]. She's a wily one that witch, from what I've heard. No doubt there's all sorts of weird magics over there!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry. I'll be careful. I've been in there once before, so I know what's there.~|~translationMissing
You've been in there? Goodness me! What did you see? Did you see a gnome in there anywhere?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so. I'm sure I would have remembered. I was looking for a ball for a boy who had lost it in the witch's garden.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, he was probably lucky that was all he lost with all that weird magic going on, eh?~|~translationMissing
Yes, quite. I'll see what I can find out though.~|~translationMissing
Ah! Good show, old kebab! I'll wait here for you. But don't be long. Who knows what that princess will do to me next!~|~translationMissing
Play an Upper E~|~translationMissing
Play an Upper F~|~translationMissing
Play an Upper D~|~translationMissing
Play an Upper C~|~translationMissing
Play an A~|~translationMissing
Play an E~|~translationMissing
Play a G~|~translationMissing
A compartment opens in the piano. It looks like you found the right tune.~|~translationMissing
You find what appears to be a To-Do list for the day, some sort of odd potion recipe and what can only be described as a shrunken vegetable of some sort.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Shrinking recipe, To-do list and 2 Shrunk ogleroot.)~|~translationMissing
There are no more shrunken ogleroots in here. You'll have to find one somewhere else.~|~translationMissing
The potion swirls and steams within the vial. It looks almost as if it is trying to make itself smaller as you look at it...~|~translationMissing
You sense a strange magical aura around you as you enter this room.~|~translationMissing
You drink the potion.~|~translationMissing
Nnnngh!~|~translationMissing
The player shrinks and enters the mouse hole.~|~translationMissing
You take the pendant. It shrinks in your hand as you touch it.~|~translationMissing
Ah! [player name], old pantaloons! Good to see you, good to see you. What news?~|~translationMissing
Princess Miazrqa has agreed to free you.~|~translationMissing
Princess Marzipan, eh? What a mouthful.~|~translationMissing
Miazrqa. It's a silent Q.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. Good show. Say, did you find out anything about my missing friend?~|~translationMissing
I did, I think. But it's not good news. The witch has your friend locked up in a cage, down under the house itself.~|~translationMissing
Good gods! That's awful! I won't have all this kidnapping nonsense! And to think we're supposed to be a civilised land!~|~translationMissing
What will you do?~|~translationMissing
I'll think of something. In the meantime, you still need to get me out of here. Maybe you should see if Miazrqa is ready to let me out.~|~translationMissing
Right. I'm on it!~|~translationMissing
I found your pendant, Princess Miazrqa!~|~translationMissing
Oh, how wonderful! I'm so grateful.~|~translationMissing
Umm, your second-cousin has some very strange...creatures she keeps.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. Those are her little darlings. I shudder to think what she might do if something were to happen to any of them.~|~translationMissing
Uh... Really?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. Why, only last month one of them got out for a wander and some horrid farmer attacked it with his ear!~|~translationMissing
With his ear?~|~translationMissing
Indeed! Tried to choke the poor thing with it. Anyway, my cousin went into a frightful rage and turned that wretched farmer into one of his own chickens. We had a lovely roast meal that day. Happy memories...~|~translationMissing
I think I feel a little ill...~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I hope you're not coming down with something.~|~translationMissing
Now, can I have the pendant please?~|~translationMissing
Will you agree to let Rupert go free?~|~translationMissing
Of course. The pendant means more to me than anything.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the pendant.~|~translationMissing
The princess looks pleased...~|~translationMissing
Cutscene with Rupert looking for his armour as he descends the tower~|~translationMissing
(Miazrqa unlocks the door.)~|~translationMissing
(Sound of heavy footsteps!)~|~translationMissing
By Saradomin! My armour was on the stairs up there!~|~translationMissing
That's better!~|~translationMissing
(Rupert comes out of the tower.)~|~translationMissing
FREEDOM!~|~translationMissing
Aha! Sweet freedom! It's good to be alive, old sweet shop! Thank you for freeing me, [player name].~|~translationMissing
End of cutscene.~|~translationMissing
(Player automatically walks up to Rupert after the cutscene.)~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]. You've done a great service for me and all the dwarves and gnomes.~|~translationMissing
I'm just happy I could help...hey! What happened to your long beard? Where did it go?~|~translationMissing
Hah! Don't fret, old penny whistle! It's still here. The front of my armour was specially crafted to allow my beard to fold up inside. Do you see?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes! I can see it now. That's pretty clever!~|~translationMissing
Indeed it is, old cheese! Now allow me to reward you in some way. All I have is my armour, but you are welcome to take any piece of it that you wish.~|~translationMissing
Please could I have the helmet?~|~translationMissing
Of course, of course. Here you go, old pumpkin.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Rupert's helmet.)~|~translationMissing
So what will you be doing now, Rupert?~|~translationMissing
Thanks to you I can carry on my investigations. Good show, old brussels sprout!~|~translationMissing
I'm glad I could help.~|~translationMissing
Princess Miazrqa, I found out what your cousin is up to.~|~translationMissing
Really? You know, I have always wondered. She's ever so secretive and never tells me anything. I was hoping she might tell me when I saw her next.~|~translationMissing
So you didn't know that she kidnaps poor defenceless gnomes?~|~translationMissing
What?! Never! That's absolutely awful! How could she? Oh, that's just so...so...mean!~|~translationMissing
I thought so too.~|~translationMissing
It's quite hard to believe. Do you have any proof?~|~translationMissing
Yes. There is a gnome in her basement right now!~|~translationMissing
How horrid! Well, when I see her I will tell her exactly what I think. Thank you for telling me all this, [player name].~|~translationMissing
You know, Rupert - the dwarf here - is trying to put a stop to what is going on. I am sure he could use your help.~|~translationMissing
Really? You may tell him that I will help him in any way I can.~|~translationMissing
Great! Thanks.~|~translationMissing
Rupert, I told Miazrqa about what the witch was doing and she was horrified by it.~|~translationMissing
I'm not surprised, old kiwi. It's a pretty ghastly business with all this kidnapping gnomes and dwarves.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Miazrqa has said she would like to help you with your investigations and that you can use this tower as your base of operations if you want.~|~translationMissing
Really? That's just fantastic! You are certainly full of surprises, [player name]. Good show!~|~translationMissing
Well, I had better be going for now. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
And to you, my friend. And to you.~|~translationMissing
Thanks again for finding my pendant. I felt so lost without it.~|~translationMissing
You're welcome. Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
I managed to get Rupert's helmet for you.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, [player name]! I'll take that as well. I hope all this work wasn't too difficult.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Rupert's helmet.)~|~translationMissing
Difficult? You have no idea! There were huge creatures trying to eat me, other creatures trying to tear me apart, witches, gnomes in distress, princesses, and I had to deal with them all!~|~translationMissing
Goodness me! I'm glad I sent you instead of going myself.~|~translationMissing
Er...I mean...I knew sending you was the right thing to do. I was sure you could handle anything that came up. Now then, the beans...~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's what all this was about wasn't it? Some beans! They must be worth a lot for this much trouble!~|~translationMissing
Actually, the beans are almost worthless.~|~translationMissing
Worthless? So why did I go to all of this trouble for you? I'm not particularly happy about that.~|~translationMissing
Calm down, my young, hot-headed friend. There was a good reason for getting these beans.~|~translationMissing
Now that you have proven yourself worthy of being a competent and trustworthy treasure collector, I can tell the real use for the beans.~|~translationMissing
As I said before, these beans are magical. There is a specially prepared mound of earth to the south-east of Taverley.~|~translationMissing
Plant the beans there and then be sure to water them well. You will need to have some knowledge of farming for this.~|~translationMissing
Ok, so then what do I do?~|~translationMissing
When the beans are planted and watered, they will grow into an enormous plant of some sort. I'm not sure what exactly. At the top of this plant is our prize.~|~translationMissing
Our prize? What exactly is this prize?~|~translationMissing
The ultimate collectible item, my dear friend. It is rumoured that in a land of clouds where none dare to tread lest they plummet to the earth, lies a goblin made of gold...~|~translationMissing
A golden goblin?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Yes, indeed! A golden goblin. Legend tells of a time when goblins discovered gold in an abandoned dwarf mine and began to mine and smelt it. What for, nobody knows. Something evil, I'd wager.~|~translationMissing
The goblins produced great smelting works, overseen by a particularly smart goblin with a head for business. Gubblebak was his name. He was shrewd, cunning and he loved gold...~|~translationMissing
He worked his fellow goblins day and night to produce more and more gold, until finally they could stand his hard labour no more and they mutinied.~|~translationMissing
They mutinied?~|~translationMissing
That's right. They turned on him. No-one is sure about the exact events, but somehow Gubblebak fell into one of the smelting pots of liquid gold.~|~translationMissing
That's horrible! Was he killed?~|~translationMissing
Well now, goblins are tough little creatures and he managed to somehow crawl out of the pot covered in hot, molten gold.~|~translationMissing
He was smart indeed, but even smart people do foolish things. He threw himself into a nearby water trough.~|~translationMissing
But surely that's what anyone would have done? Why is that a bad thing?~|~translationMissing
Ahh, well you see...when you take hot liquid metal and cool it instantly, it becomes rock hard straight away. That's how blacksmiths make their weapons and armour.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I see. So Gubblebak became hard as a rock?~|~translationMissing
That's right. And that's the way he stayed ever afterwards. So the legend says, at least. And the cloud area will be waiting for you when you have planted the beans to find this golden goblin.~|~translationMissing
So let me see if I have this straight.~|~translationMissing
I need to plant the beans in an earth mound south-east of here, water them, let them grow into some big plant and then climb the plant to get to a cloudy area, find a golden goblin and bring it back to you?~|~translationMissing
Exactly right! You've got it. Now did I mention about the giant?~|~translationMissing
The...giant?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. The giant.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm pretty sure you didn't mention any giants! What giant? Now would be a good time to mention it if you were going to!~|~translationMissing
Oh right, sorry. Must have slipped my mind. There's a bit of a large-ish giant up there. Uh...shouldn't be anything to worry about. But...uh...I think he might have the goblin, you see.~|~translationMissing
So how exactly do I get the goblin then?~|~translationMissing
Well, you're probably going to have to kill him for it. But...but a big strong adventurer like yourself shouldn't have any trouble whatsoever with that, I'm sure!~|~translationMissing
Here are the beans as promised.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Magic beans.)~|~translationMissing
Ok then, to recap. I need to plant the beans over there, water them, let them grow into some big plant, climb the plant to get to a cloudy area, kill a giant, find a golden goblin and bring it back to you?~|~translationMissing
Oh, well done! You do pay attention! Good luck!~|~translationMissing
Thanks...I think I'm going to need it.~|~translationMissing
So then. Do you want to run through what you need to do for me again?~|~translationMissing
Ok then, to recap~|~translationMissing
I need to plant the beans, water them, let them grow into some big plant, climb the plant to get to a cloudy area, kill a giant, find a golden goblin and bring it back to you?~|~translationMissing
There is more writing on the sign. It reads~|~translationMissing
'This earth mound has been magically prepared. Please keep off.Farming strictly prohibited. You have been warned!'~|~translationMissing
You succeed in making the ground a little muddy...but not much else.~|~translationMissing
You plant the beans in the dry ground. Perhaps you should give them some water as well.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene shows the bean growing into a giant beanstalk.~|~translationMissing
You sense something about to happen...~|~translationMissing
(Player waters the soil and it immediately grows into a giant beanstalk.)~|~translationMissing
Woah!~|~translationMissing
(Player performs Jump for Joy emote.)~|~translationMissing
I've grown the beans into a huge stalk, as you asked. What am I supposed to do now?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, have you climbed up the stalk yet?~|~translationMissing
Very well. Did you find the giant?~|~translationMissing
Right then. Did you defeat him and find the golden goblin?~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Well done. Now bring me the golden goblin and we're almost done.~|~translationMissing
Umm...what happens if I forget to pick up the golden goblin after defeating the giant and leave?~|~translationMissing
Well, I expect it will still be waiting up there for you when you go back up. It's highly unlikely anyone would risk going up there to steal it.~|~translationMissing
Right then, that's your next task. You will need to defeat that giant to get the golden goblin from him.~|~translationMissing
He wasn't there? This is highly irregular. Are you sure you looked properly? I expect he'd be hard to miss.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and have another look.~|~translationMissing
Right, then you will need to climb the stalk and find the golden goblin for me.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find it?~|~translationMissing
I think a big giant has it at the top of the stalk. You will need to get it from him.~|~translationMissing
Right. I'm on my way.~|~translationMissing
Early during fight, only happens once~|~translationMissing
Glod~|~translationMissing
Gods, give Glod strength!~|~translationMissing
Glod appears to have more Strength and Attack power than before!~|~translationMissing
You wouldn't like Glod when Glod angry!~|~translationMissing
Glod bash!~|~translationMissing
Glod smash!~|~translationMissing
Stupid clouds make Glod angry!~|~translationMissing
Grind your bones!~|~translationMissing
Why everyone attack Glod?~|~translationMissing
(During an attack) A random dialogue is selected from the following~|~translationMissing
Flee, pesky mortal!~|~translationMissing
At Glod's cry you are forced to run away!~|~translationMissing
You puny human. Come to Glod!~|~translationMissing
You are enraged by Glod's taunts and forced to charge towards him to fight!~|~translationMissing
GLOD SMASH!~|~translationMissing
Your prayer is drained by Glod's attack!~|~translationMissing
At low Hitpoints~|~translationMissing
Glod not die so easily!~|~translationMissing
Gold heals himself slightly.~|~translationMissing
Sylas! I found the golden goblin!~|~translationMissing
Excellent work, Player! Now, that giant will likely have friends. It is too dangerous to leave that stalk up there like that.~|~translationMissing
Ok, so what should we do?~|~translationMissing
First, let me take that goblin from you. Next we need to cut down that beanstalk as soon as possible. I hope you're a good woodcutter!~|~translationMissing
Find an axe. Any axe should do. Then cut down that stalk as soon as you can before another giant finds out what you have done and comes for us!~|~translationMissing
Can you remind me what I am doing now?~|~translationMissing
You've forgotten already? Did you get hit on the head by that giant? Do you have amnesia?~|~translationMissing
No, I just can't remember what I am supposed to do.~|~translationMissing
I see.~|~translationMissing
You've given the Golden Goblin to Sylas already. You don't think going back up there would be prudent!~|~translationMissing
You will need an axe to cut down the beanstalk.~|~translationMissing
The beanstalk is too thick for you to cut through. Perhaps there is a way of making it thinner?~|~translationMissing
A cutscene shows the beanstalk shrinking to normal size.~|~translationMissing
(Player pours the shrinking potion on the beanstalk.)~|~translationMissing
Cool!~|~translationMissing
(Player performs Laugh emote.)~|~translationMissing
A cutscene shows the beanstalk being chopped down.~|~translationMissing
You attempt to cut the beanstalk down...~|~translationMissing
Timber!~|~translationMissing
(Player chops down the stalk.)~|~translationMissing
(Player performs Dance emote.)~|~translationMissing
You have already cut the beanstalk down.~|~translationMissing
You decide that doing that would not be the most prudent of actions.~|~translationMissing
Have you cut down the stalk?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's done.~|~translationMissing
Good work, [player name]! At last we can relax. We've completed our task and you have done me a great service!~|~translationMissing
Now, let me reward you. You may have wondered what possible use I could have had for Rupert's helmet.~|~translationMissing
It did indeed seem like an odd item to look for.~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes! However, tucked inside the helmet is a tiny bottle with a very special potion. It was made by a witch, here in Taverley, but Rupert must have found it.~|~translationMissing
Not knowing what the potion was, he simply tucked it away in his helmet.~|~translationMissing
Not more potions?! I've had enough of potions for now.~|~translationMissing
Relax, my friend. This potion is almost harmless. It is actually a particularly strong hair-tonic.~|~translationMissing
Oh! Well, that would explain Rupert's beard then.~|~translationMissing
Yes, indeed! I also imagine poor Rupert never understood why his beard grew so alarmingly fast. Poor lad.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I have removed the potion now and you may keep the helmet along with your rewards. Don't worry, it's quite harmless and the helmet should help you in your adventures.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Dwarven helmet.)~|~translationMissing
Great work, [player name]. Now, I have something for you, but you're going to need a space in your inventory. Speak to me again when you have made some room.~|~translationMissing

Ceril Carnillean~|~translationMissing
Blooming, thieving cultists! Why don't they leave me alone? String them all up, that's what I say!~|~translationMissing
It's those blooming cultists from the south! They keep breaking into my house!~|~translationMissing
Have they taken much?~|~translationMissing
Well... no. They stole a suit of armour when they first broke in months ago, but they've been back four more times since then and taken nothing.~|~translationMissing
I see. And you are?~|~translationMissing
You don't know me? Why, I am Sir Ceril Carnillean! Mine is quite a famous bloodline, you know. We've played a vital role in the politics of Ardougne for many generations.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm [player name]. Maybe I can help you with these cultists?~|~translationMissing
Interesting... I suppose the authorities haven't been much help so far. Yes, very well. If you return the stolen armour, I will provide you with a modest cash reward!~|~translationMissing
If the player is below level 10 combat~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended level of 10.~|~translationMissing
Start the Hazeel Cult quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course, I'd be happy to help.~|~translationMissing
That's very noble of you! Keep that attitude up and one day you might have the honour of working full-time for someone like me.~|~translationMissing
Now, I caught a glimpse of the thieves leaving, but due to... uh... my cold, I was unable to give chase.~|~translationMissing
What I do know is that they belong to some sort of cult. They seem to be based in a cave just south of the city, near the Clock Tower.~|~translationMissing
My old butler, Higson, once followed them there. Unfortunately, the next night he died in his sleep.~|~translationMissing
That's awful!~|~translationMissing
No, it's okay. Jones, a replacement from the Servants' Guild, arrived the next day. He's been great - makes an excellent broth!~|~translationMissing
Right... I'll see if I can find this cave.~|~translationMissing
No thanks. I've got other plans.~|~translationMissing
Well no wonder I'm the one with the big house and you're the one on the streets.~|~translationMissing
You probably deserve it.~|~translationMissing
And who are you to judge me? You look like a peasant anyway. I'm wasting my time talking to you.~|~translationMissing
You seem uptight, I'll leave you alone.~|~translationMissing
You seem uptight. I'll leave you alone.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I doubt you could help anyway.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Ceril.~|~translationMissing
That's Sir Ceril to you, you impudent scamp. Show a bit of respect to your betters. Now, shouldn't you be recovering my armour?~|~translationMissing
Yeah yeah, I'm on it.~|~translationMissing
Good. I suggest you start with that cave south of the city, near the Clock Tower. That is where the cult is based.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I hear you're after that cult who broke in the other night. It always gladdens me when civilians assist the law like this.~|~translationMissing
I'm just happy to be of help.~|~translationMissing
Butler Jones~|~translationMissing
Hello. How are you today?~|~translationMissing
Good thank you, and yourself?~|~translationMissing
Very well, thank you.~|~translationMissing
Henryeta Carnillean~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello. I'm afraid I'm not very presentable at the moment. I've been under incredible stress of late! It's ruining my complexion!~|~translationMissing
Why? What's wrong?~|~translationMissing
It's those awful cultists! I just don't feel safe here anymore!~|~translationMissing
Philipe Carnillean~|~translationMissing
Mommy said you're here to kill all the nasty people that keep breaking in.~|~translationMissing
Can I watch?~|~translationMissing
Claus the Chef~|~translationMissing
Sorry, can't stop to chat! You would be amazed at how many meals this family gets through daily!~|~translationMissing
A pot of soup is bubbling away on the range.~|~translationMissing
Claus Carnillean~|~translationMissing
Oi - I don't want people messing around with my range!~|~translationMissing
Clivet~|~translationMissing
Hey! I don't remember saying you could use that raft!~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
You can call me Clivet. What do you want, adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Do you know the Carnilleans?~|~translationMissing
Carnilleans? Don't think I've ever heard of them.~|~translationMissing
Look, I know you're lying. I know all about your cult.~|~translationMissing
Is that so? In that case, I'd say you'd be wise to leave now.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, I have a job to do. I'm not leaving until it's done.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. That two-faced snob has made you fall for his propaganda, eh?~|~translationMissing
The Carnillean home does not belong to them. It was built long ago by the great Lord Hazeel, who once ruled over this entire region.~|~translationMissing
Many years ago, the Carnilleans led a rebellion against Lord Hazeel and all who followed him. Under the cover of darkness, they stormed his home in an angry mob, torturing and butchering everyone they found.~|~translationMissing
The following morning, the Carnillean forefathers moved into the empty household and claimed it as their own. They have grown fat on the hard work of Lord Hazeel ever since.~|~translationMissing
Right... And what happened to this Hazeel?~|~translationMissing
The foolish Carnilleans believed him dead. Unluckily for them, being an all-powerful Mahjarrat gave him access to powers and enchantments they knew nothing of.~|~translationMissing
As they stormed his home, Lord Hazeel made preparations for his eventual return. We, his faithful followers, have been working to bring that about ever since.~|~translationMissing
What makes you think I care about the politics and histories of Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
I could kill you right now and be done with it, but I don't think you're the fool that the Carnilleans believe you to be. Instead, I offer you a chance to join us.~|~translationMissing
Help us bring about the return of Lord Hazeel, and you will be well rewarded. However, should you continue to try and prevent his return, you will suffer the wrath of Zamorak.~|~translationMissing
Before I decide, I have some questions for you.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more about Hazeel.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hazeel is one of the great Mahjarrat who once fought alongside Zamorak himself. He ruled this region for many years, until the cowardly Carnilleans rebelled against him.~|~translationMissing
But he survived?~|~translationMissing
Of course! The Mahjarrat know magic that others can only dream of. Lord Hazeel used his abilities to ensure that one day he'd eventually return. That day will soon be upon us.~|~translationMissing
Why did the Carnilleans rebel against Hazeel?~|~translationMissing
The Carnilleans served the pathetic Saradomin. They considered it their duty to overthrow Hazeel due to his loyalties to Zamorak. They were fools, blinded by Saradominist propaganda!~|~translationMissing
Saradominist propaganda?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Something even more prevalent today. Too many people now are fooled into believing that Saradomin is a god of good, while Zamorak is evil. Those lies couldn't be further from the truth!~|~translationMissing
Why do you keep breaking into the Carnillean Mansion?~|~translationMissing
There is something we need inside. I will say no more unless you agree to join us.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about the Mahjarrat?~|~translationMissing
Surely you have heard of the Mahjarrat? Their race is the ultimate example of power! Each of them wields the strength of an entire army. To oppose any one of them, is to face your doom!~|~translationMissing
And Hazeel is one of them?~|~translationMissing
More than that! Hazeel is one of the greatest Mahjarrat to have ever lived!~|~translationMissing
Actually, I have no questions.~|~translationMissing
I have no more questions.~|~translationMissing
Then we have nothing more to discuss until you've made your choice.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I've made my decision.~|~translationMissing
I'll help you.~|~translationMissing
Good. Now, we are not the monsters that the Carnilleans would claim we are, so we were hoping to do this without violence. However, the fact they sent you here makes it clear that won't work now.~|~translationMissing
Meaning?~|~translationMissing
You must prove your loyalty to our cause, and Ceril Carnillean must die. Kill him for us, and we will know you are truly dedicated to Lord Hazeel.~|~translationMissing
Alright, how do I do it?~|~translationMissing
I can already tell I was right about you. I can see you are of exactly the right character to join the followers of Hazeel.~|~translationMissing
Here, take this poison and pour it into Ceril Carnillean's food. Once the deed is done, return here and speak to me once more.~|~translationMissing
Clivet tries to give you some poison, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player inventory space~|~translationMissing
I need some time to think on this.~|~translationMissing
Don't take too long.~|~translationMissing
I won't help you.~|~translationMissing
Then you are a fool. Go back to your small-minded little life. You will never know the glories you could have tasted as one of us!~|~translationMissing
You know I'm going to stop you, right?~|~translationMissing
You'll try, but you'll never find us.~|~translationMissing
Clivet jumps onto the nearby raft and pushes off into the sewer system.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I need more time to think on this.~|~translationMissing
So, you've returned. I hope you're here because you've recognised the folly in serving the Carnilleans. Think about what you could achieve if you join us instead.~|~translationMissing
Alomone~|~translationMissing
How did you get in here?~|~translationMissing
I've come for the Carnillean family armour. Hand it over, or face the consequences.~|~translationMissing
I thought I made it clear to Jones that you could not be allowed to interfere with our mission. The incompetent fool must be going soft.~|~translationMissing
So the butler's part of your little cult? Why is it always the butler? I should have known...~|~translationMissing
Well you won't live long enough to tell anyone! Die!~|~translationMissing
You! Leave this place at once, before we're forced to make you!~|~translationMissing
Hazeel Cultist~|~translationMissing
You have no place here! Leave now, before someone makes you!~|~translationMissing
Get away from that chest!~|~translationMissing
You find some armour in the chest, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has enough space~|~translationMissing
You find some armour in the chest.~|~translationMissing
You're back. Have you had any luck yet?~|~translationMissing
Look! I've recovered your armour!~|~translationMissing
Well done! I must say I am very impressed! Come on, hand it over.~|~translationMissing
You give the armour to Ceril.~|~translationMissing
Before we send you on your way with your payment, I'll just get Jones to whip you up a batch of his special broth.~|~translationMissing
I'd rather not if it's all the same to you. Apparently Jones is in league with the cultists.~|~translationMissing
What? Right! You! We're going to blooming well sort this out right now, once and for all!~|~translationMissing
Jones! This commoner says you had something to do with the cultists that stole my armour. What do you have to say for yourself?~|~translationMissing
Nothing to do with me, sir. I am, as you know, a loyal servant.~|~translationMissing
Humph. Quite right too. I cannot fathom why this scoundrel would accuse you of such a crime without evidence to back up the accusations.~|~translationMissing
Right, I have made a decision. I have given my word as a nobleman to reward you for your efforts in retrieving my armour, but I must also compensate Jones for this terrible slander.~|~translationMissing
Now take this and leave! And don't darken my doorstep again!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, sir, he won't be bothering us any more.~|~translationMissing
Jones smirks at you. You are going to need more than words to prove his treachery.~|~translationMissing
You search the cupboard and find a bottle of poison along with a mysterious amulet.~|~translationMissing
And what do we have here...~|~translationMissing
Ceril!~|~translationMissing
What do you want now you scoundrel?~|~translationMissing
Take a look at what I've found.~|~translationMissing
What's this... Poison?~|~translationMissing
Jones?~|~translationMissing
Just for killing rats, sir.~|~translationMissing
Right... but this amulet... I recognise this! Those cultists wore amulets like this!~|~translationMissing
Jones! We trusted you! We took you into our home!~|~translationMissing
You senile old fool... it was all too easy! I should have killed you and your pathetic family weeks ago!~|~translationMissing
Guard!~|~translationMissing
This man is one of those cultists! Take him away!~|~translationMissing
Don't think this is over, Ceril! You will die at the hands of the Hazeel Cult! I promise you that!~|~translationMissing
Well... It looks like I am indebted to you!~|~translationMissing
No problem. We all make mistakes.~|~translationMissing
But if it weren't for you... my whole family... we could have been...~|~translationMissing
I apologise for my harshness before. The very least I can do is to reward you for your noble efforts, and to offer my sincerest apologies as a gentleman.~|~translationMissing
No, no, thank you! Feel free to stop by anytime, adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Quest complete~|~translationMissing
Hello again, adventurer! It's good to see you! If it wasn't for your quick thinking, the treacherous Jones would have probably poisoned my family and I by now! We are in your debt.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about it! A good deed is its own reward. And that money didn't hurt either.~|~translationMissing
Well look who it is! Good to see you managed to clear your name. I always had faith in you!~|~translationMissing
Thanks! So is everything all quiet around here now?~|~translationMissing
Indeed! For now at least, everything is back to normal.~|~translationMissing
What have you brought me? I want some more toys!~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't have any toys.~|~translationMissing
Toys! I want toys!~|~translationMissing
Hello again, adventurer. Since you dealt with those horrible cultists, things have vastly improved for us around here!~|~translationMissing
I'm happy to have helped.~|~translationMissing
Hey.~|~translationMissing
Well hello there, adventurer! Are we fit and well?~|~translationMissing
Here's that poison you need. Take it and pour it into Ceril Carnillean's food. Once the deed is done, return here and speak to me once more.~|~translationMissing
Clivet gives you some poison.~|~translationMissing
You have a mission for us, adventurer. Go to the Carnilliean household and poison Ceril Carnillean's meal to prove your loyalty.~|~translationMissing
If the player has poison in their inventory~|~translationMissing
If the player has no poison in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I need some more poison.~|~translationMissing
Fool! Be more careful with it this time.~|~translationMissing
Hello, adventurer. I hear your quest is going well.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. Do keep up the good work.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, Ceril.~|~translationMissing
That's Sir Ceril you blooming scoundrel! Show respect when addressing someone of my rank! I must say, I am a bit disapointed you haven't made any progress. Maybe I was wrong about you.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, well, just unlucky I guess.~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello. I hope you've found those awful cultists! I simply cannot sleep at night knowing they're loose!~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I haven't found them yet.~|~translationMissing
Well you really are useless, aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Yup, I guess I am.~|~translationMissing
You're that adventurer the family asked to help deal with those weird cultists, right?~|~translationMissing
That's me.~|~translationMissing
Good luck with that!~|~translationMissing
Pour the poison into the pot?~|~translationMissing
You pour the poison into the pot and it dissolves into the soup.~|~translationMissing
You've already done enough poisoning.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Caught any of those weird cultists yet?~|~translationMissing
Afraid not.~|~translationMissing
Well, keep at it!~|~translationMissing
Those hooligans! They slaughtered my precious Scruffy! I shall never recover! I am emotionally scarred for life!~|~translationMissing
Yeah... Hopefully someone finds them soon.~|~translationMissing
Hello, adventurer. Such a terrible shame about Scruffy. I wonder if the family will ever fully recover.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I hear your quest is going well.~|~translationMissing
Someone killed Scruffy. I liked Scruffy. He never told me off.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... it's a real shame.~|~translationMissing
I want my mommy.~|~translationMissing
Oh the inhumanity... the cruelty... the misery... the pain...~|~translationMissing
My son is a good boy, really, but how could he give his dinner to Scruffy without having the servants test it for poison first? How? How could he be so thoughtless and careless? He knows we are all under threat!~|~translationMissing
Scruffy?~|~translationMissing
He's been with our family for twenty years... that's 140 in dog years! The poor dog... What did he ever do to deserve such a fate?~|~translationMissing
Your dog got poisoned? That's not right.~|~translationMissing
I agree! I hope whichever evildoer is responsible gets the full weight of the law brought upon them!~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah... me too.~|~translationMissing
Oh the misery... How could someone do something like this?~|~translationMissing
Uh... I'm sure they won't get away with it...~|~translationMissing
Today is a dark day. Those cultists have been back, and this time they've gone further than ever before! Murder! We can't afford to keep letting them get away with this.~|~translationMissing
I poisoned the food as requested, but it didn't quite go to plan.~|~translationMissing
Yes, we heard all about it from one of our sources. It's a shame that Ceril Carnillean survived, but that is no fault of yours. You have proven your loyalty to Hazeel.~|~translationMissing
I would like you to meet with our leader, Alomone. You'll find him in our hideout, deeper in the sewers. You can use this raft to get there.~|~translationMissing
However, be warned that reaching the hideout is impossible unless the flow of water down here is set correctly. You'll need to use the sewer valves above to do that.~|~translationMissing
But how will I know how to set the valves?~|~translationMissing
For that, you'll need this.~|~translationMissing
Clivet tries to give you an amulet, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Clivet gives you an amulet.~|~translationMissing
Going from left to right, turn each of the five sewer valves above so that they follow the design of the amulet. Once you've done that, you'll be able to use the raft here to enter our hideout.~|~translationMissing
Here, you'll need this.~|~translationMissing
I lost that amulet you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Careless! Look afer[sic] this one!~|~translationMissing
What am I meant to be doing?~|~translationMissing
Use the raft here to enter our hideout and meet with our leader, Alomone.~|~translationMissing
Be warned, you'll need to ensure the flow of water down here is set correctly for you to be able to use the raft.~|~translationMissing
Going from left to right, turn each of the five sewer valves above so that they follow the design of the amulet I gave you.~|~translationMissing
The current is flowing against the raft. It won't move.~|~translationMissing
The valve is currently turned to the right.~|~translationMissing
Turn it to the left.~|~translationMissing
You turn the valve to the left. Beneath your feet you hear the sudden sound of rushing water.~|~translationMissing
You leave the valve alone.~|~translationMissing
The valve is currently turned to the left.~|~translationMissing
Turn it to the right.~|~translationMissing
You turn the valve to the right. Beneath your feet you hear the sudden sound of rushing water.~|~translationMissing
The raft washes up the sewer and stops at the first island. You'll need to find the right combination of the five sewer valves above if you want to go further.~|~translationMissing
The raft flows back to the cave entrance.~|~translationMissing
The raft washes up the sewer and stops at the second island. You'll need to find the right combination of the five sewer valves above if you want to go further.~|~translationMissing
The raft washes up the sewer and stops at the fourth island. You'll need to find the right combination of the five sewer valves above if you want to go further.~|~translationMissing
The raft washes up the sewer and stops at the third island. You'll need to find the right combination of the five sewer valves above if you want to go further.~|~translationMissing
The raft washes up the sewer until it reaches the end of the passage.~|~translationMissing
I cannot talk right now. Lord Hazeel will soon be back with us and I have many preparations to make.~|~translationMissing
Well, well, well... we have a new recruit. Clivet told me of your desire to join us in our glorious task to resurrect the mighty Hazeel.~|~translationMissing
Well if all goes well, you'll play a key role in just that. Before his defeat, Hazeel secured within his home a powerful magical scroll of restoration. It remains there still, hidden to even the foolish Carnilleans.~|~translationMissing
Up to now, our attempts to recover this scroll have been met with disappointment. However, I know you will not fail us.~|~translationMissing
So you want me to find this scroll?~|~translationMissing
That is correct. You must return to the Carnillean Mansion and find where it is hidden. We already have an agent in place to support you.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Their Butler Jones is in fact a faithful follower of Hazeel. He has been unsuccessful in locating the scroll himself, but together the two of you will find it.~|~translationMissing
Now, go with haste. Soon we will restore Hazeel to his true power and glory!~|~translationMissing
Hello, Alomone.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel has already waited far too long for his return. It is imperative that you find that scroll! It hides somewhere within the Carnillean Mansion.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'm on it.~|~translationMissing
It is good to see you once more, adventurer. Glory to Hazeel!~|~translationMissing
Hello, Ceril. How's things?~|~translationMissing
Sir Ceril! Sir! And things are terrible! Our beloved dog is dead, and I fear it's only a matter of time before those cultists strike again!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'm sure it will all be okay in the end.~|~translationMissing
I just don't understand it! How? How could someone poison my delicious food without me even noticing? I... I just don't get it!~|~translationMissing
Oh man... I hope I don't lose my job over this... but how? How did they do it? And why would they want to kill poor Scruffy anyway? He was such a good dog...~|~translationMissing
Yeah... it's a real mystery.~|~translationMissing
Ceril. How are you?~|~translationMissing
Oh cruel world! Scruffy... I knew you well... I... just... don't think I can... go on without...~|~translationMissing
Sir Ceril breaks down into tears.~|~translationMissing
Loosen up already. It was only a DOG.~|~translationMissing
I'm making progress. On that note, I hear you might be able to help me with my next task.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the scroll. I'm afraid I've searched high and low, but have so far been unable to locate it. I'm sure it is somewhere within the house, hidden where even the family won't find it.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... So it must be somewhere they'd have never stepped foot. I'll keep on looking.~|~translationMissing
You knock on the wall. It sounds like there's a hollow space on the other side.~|~translationMissing
Push against the wall?~|~translationMissing
The player enters the wall.~|~translationMissing
The chest is locked. It looks like it needs a key.~|~translationMissing
With a full inventory~|~translationMissing
You search the crate and find an old key hidden at the bottom, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Without a full inventory~|~translationMissing
You search the crate and find an old key hidden at the bottom.~|~translationMissing
You unlock the chest and find a scroll inside, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You unlock the chest and find a scroll inside.~|~translationMissing
You already have the scroll from this chest.~|~translationMissing
Hello, adventurer. How is your quest going?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the scroll~|~translationMissing
I'm making progress.~|~translationMissing
Good. Remember, the scroll must be somewhere within the house, hidden where even the family won't find it.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I'll keep on looking.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the scroll~|~translationMissing
I have the scroll!~|~translationMissing
Then you should waste no time in returning to Alomone. The return of Hazeel will soon be upon us!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry. I am far too upset to talk to anybody right now. Oh... poor Scruffy...~|~translationMissing
Yeah... poor Scruffy.~|~translationMissing
Hello, adventurer. I hope you find the cult soon. We have a horrible suspicion that there's been another burglary.~|~translationMissing
That's worrying.~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is. The thing is, we can't even work out what they've taken! It's all very odd.~|~translationMissing
Have you brought the scroll of restoration?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the scroll in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have it right here.~|~translationMissing
At long last! With the words contained within this scroll, our lord shall finally return to us!~|~translationMissing
Watch adventurer, and witness the glorious rebirth of Hazeel!~|~translationMissing
Cutscene~|~translationMissing
Sentente sillaberi junque dithmento! Ia! Ia! Dextrimon encanto! Termando... Imcando... Solly enty rando... Sentente! Ia! Ia! Indenti zaggarati g'thxa!~|~translationMissing
Dintenta! Sententa! Retenta! Q'exjta! Ia! Sottottott! Ia! Dysmenta junque fammatio svelken! Sottey! Sentey! Soloment!~|~translationMissing
My loyal followers, I have pride in you all. You have achieved a feat many would have considered impossible and returned me to this land.~|~translationMissing
Much time has passed and I have much to attend to, but first, I believe there is one here who deserves my gratitude.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, I know that your efforts were essential in bringing about my return. You have my thanks. Know that I consider you an ally.~|~translationMissing
Now, I must leave you, loyal subjects, for time is short. My Mahjarrat kin will soon head northwards, and I have much to prepare.~|~translationMissing
Rest assured, when my work is done, I will return to you. Before long, the world will know of Hazeel once more!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the scroll in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Nope, sorry.~|~translationMissing
You must find it and bring it to me! Hazeel has already waited far too long for his return.~|~translationMissing

Larrissa~|~translationMissing
Oh, thank Armadyl! I am in such a worry... please help me!~|~translationMissing
With what?~|~translationMissing
Oh... it is terrible... horrible... My boyfriend lives here in this lighthouse, but I haven't seen him the last few days! I think something terrible has happened!~|~translationMissing
Look, you can see for yourself that the light has gone out, and the front door is locked up tight! He would NEVER do that!~|~translationMissing
With the light off this coastline is terribly dangerous to ships! And to lock the front door so that nobody can turn the light back on?~|~translationMissing
Maybe he just went on holiday or something? Must be pretty boring living in a lighthouse.~|~translationMissing
That is terribly irresponsible! He is far too thoughtful for that! He would never leave it unattended! He would also never leave without telling me!~|~translationMissing
Please, I know something terrible has happened to him... I can sense it! Please... please help me adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Well, we have to do something to get the lighthouse working again! Also, as you may have noticed, the storm that knocked the bridge out~|~translationMissing
has trapped me on this causeway! You seem to have got here okay somehow, so if you could go and visit my cousin and get the spare key I left him,~|~translationMissing
as well as fix the bridge enough so that I can go and speak to my family in Rellekka and tell them whats happened, I will be eternally grateful!~|~translationMissing
Start the Horror from the Deep quest?~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll help!~|~translationMissing
OH! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I know my darling would never have left with the lighthouse lights off and without even telling me where he's gone!~|~translationMissing
Where is your cousin?~|~translationMissing
My cousin was always interested in agility. He left our home in Rellekka many moons ago, so that he could pursue this interest.~|~translationMissing
I don't exactly know where he has gone, but I am sure he went somewhere to practise his agility. If you see him, his name is Gunnjorn. Mention my name, he will recognise it.~|~translationMissing
How can I fix the bridge?~|~translationMissing
Well, I am not just some helpless girl! I have pretty good agility, so you will only need to use two planks to make a ledge that I can balance along.~|~translationMissing
Just use a plank on each side of the bridge. You will need a hammer, and thirty steel nails for each plank you use as well. I believe there are some planks near here...~|~translationMissing
I'll see what I can do~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, just passing through.~|~translationMissing
Oh... my poor darling Jossik... I just know something terrible has happened...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, just passing through~|~translationMissing
Oh, please find my darling! I just know something horrible has happened!~|~translationMissing
Gunnjorn~|~translationMissing
Haha welcome to my obstacle course. Have fun, but remember this isn't a child's playground. People have died here.~|~translationMissing
Hi, are you called Gunnjorn?~|~translationMissing
Why, indeed I am. I own this agility course, it can be very dangerous!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, that's great. Anyway, I understand you have a cousin named Larrissa who gave you a key...?~|~translationMissing
Yes, she did! How do you know of this? She said she probably wouldn't need it, but gave it to me for safe keeping just in case.~|~translationMissing
Well, something has happened at the lighthouse, and she has been locked out. I need you to give me her key.~|~translationMissing
Well, I would give you the key, but apparently you don't have any room.~|~translationMissing
With open inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
Sure. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
Welcome again to my obstacle course. Have fun, but remember this isn't a child's playground. People have died here.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, Gunnjorn. I'm afraid I've lost that key you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Well, I would give you another, but apparently you don't have any room.~|~translationMissing
No problem. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
What? My cousin is the one who gave you my spare copy of the lighthouse key. Do you have memory problems, adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Um... no... I was just... Testing you. Yeah. Testing.~|~translationMissing
I've got your key for you!~|~translationMissing
Thank you adventurer, but I need you to fix the bridge for me. The key to the lighthouse is of little comfort while I am trapped here on this causeway!~|~translationMissing
I've fixed the bridge for you!~|~translationMissing
Oh, thank you so much!~|~translationMissing
Please find the key to the lighthouse for me though!~|~translationMissing
I cannot bear to think that something bad may have happened to my darling Jossik...~|~translationMissing
You unlock the Lighthouse front door.~|~translationMissing
Please adventurer... We are both curious as to what has happened in that lighthouse, but you need to fix the bridge for me!~|~translationMissing
That won't help fix the bridge.~|~translationMissing
You create half a makeshift walkway out of the plank.~|~translationMissing
You have now made a makeshift walkway over the bridge.~|~translationMissing
Quickly, we must go inside and find out what has happened to my beloved Jossik!~|~translationMissing
You must fix the lighthouse before any ships crash!~|~translationMissing
This is terrible...~|~translationMissing
What can have happened here? Please, you must fix the light, we cannot let my darling Jossik take the blame for any shipwrecks!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I will see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
What am I supposed to be doing again?~|~translationMissing
You MUST find a way to fix the lighthouse! The ships are in terrible danger as long as the light is not working properly!~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea how I could do that?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry adventurer, I do not know anything about lighthouses.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure there must be some kind of user's guide around here somewhere though.~|~translationMissing
My darling Jossik knew nothing about Lighthouses when he first came here, so the council must have left him some kind of manual or something.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer! You MUST do something about the broken light!~|~translationMissing
It is terribly important that ships coming round this coastline do not crash here!~|~translationMissing
Please adventurer... Do not let curiosity get the better of you! We Have to fix the lighthouse before any accidents happen!~|~translationMissing
There are three books here that look important... What would you like to do?~|~translationMissing
Take the Lighthouse Manual~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an open inventory space~|~translationMissing
You do not have enough room to take that.~|~translationMissing
If the player does have inventory space~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Manual.)~|~translationMissing
Take the ancient Diary~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Diary (Horror from the Deep).)~|~translationMissing
Take Jossiks' Journal~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Journal (Horror from the Deep).)~|~translationMissing
Take all three books~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have three open inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
You do not have enough room to take all three.~|~translationMissing
If the player does have inventory space for all three~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Manual, Diary (Horror from the Deep)}, and Journal (Horror from the Deep).)~|~translationMissing
You use the swamp tar to make the torch flammable again.~|~translationMissing
You light the torch with your tinderbox~|~translationMissing
You use the molten glass to repair the lens~|~translationMissing
You have managed to repair the lighthouse torch!~|~translationMissing
I have managed to fix the light!~|~translationMissing
Excellent work, adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Now you can devote all of your energies to finding out what has happened to my darling Jossik!~|~translationMissing
Jossik~|~translationMissing
NO! No, you can't leave me now! Look! They're coming again! Do something!~|~translationMissing
Have you found any sign of my darling Jossik yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet...~|~translationMissing
I came out here to see if I could find some sign of him...~|~translationMissing
But there is nothing at all. I am so worried...~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine. I'll find him somehow.~|~translationMissing
I don't think I'll get that back if I put it in there.~|~translationMissing
Really place the rune into the door?~|~translationMissing
If the rune was a air rune~|~translationMissing
You place an air rune into the slow in the wall.~|~translationMissing
If the rune was a earth rune~|~translationMissing
You place an earth rune into the slow in the wall.~|~translationMissing
If the rune was a fire rune~|~translationMissing
You place a fire rune into the slow in the wall.~|~translationMissing
If the rune was a water rune~|~translationMissing
You place a water rune into the slow in the wall.~|~translationMissing
Really place the arrow into the door?~|~translationMissing
You place an arrow into the slot in the wall.~|~translationMissing
Really place the weapon into the door?~|~translationMissing
You place a sword into the slot in the wall.[confirmation needed]~|~translationMissing
You hear the sound of something moving within the wall.~|~translationMissing
*cough* Please... please help me... I think my leg is broken, and those creatures will be back any minute now!~|~translationMissing
I guess you're Jossik then... What creatures are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
I... I do not know. I have never seen their like before!~|~translationMissing
I was searching for information about my uncle Silas, who vanished mysteriously from this lighthouse many months ago. I found the secret of that strange wall, and discovered that I could use it as a door, but when I~|~translationMissing
came down here I was attacked by...~|~translationMissing
Well, I do not know what they are, but they are very strong! They hurt me badly enough to trap me here, and I have been fearing for my life ever since!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'm here now. Larrissa was worried about you and asked for my help.~|~translationMissing
I'll go back upstairs and let her know that I've found you and that you're still alive, and then we can work out some way of getting you out of here, okay?~|~translationMissing
A dagannoth appears and attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
Okay, now that the creature's dead we can get you out of here.~|~translationMissing
No... you do not understand...~|~translationMissing
That was not the creature that attacked me...~|~translationMissing
That was one of its babies...~|~translationMissing
The daganoth mother appears and attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
I found Jossik! He's in a cavern underground...~|~translationMissing
That is wonderful news! But why does he not come up out of there?~|~translationMissing
Um... well, there's a big monster down there with him stopping him leaving.~|~translationMissing
What?!?! You MUST save him! I beseech you, please! Do something!~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, sheesh, keep your hair on...~|~translationMissing
Dagannoth mother~|~translationMissing
Krrrrrrk~|~translationMissing
The Dagannoth changes to blue...~|~translationMissing

Good day, wanderer.~|~translationMissing
Wanderer~|~translationMissing
Hello to you too, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Hiss!~|~translationMissing
Aghhh get that cat away from me. Quickly please.~|~translationMissing
Why? What's your problem with it?~|~translationMissing
Just take it away please. Take it away. If you do, I'll tell you of the secret passageway.~|~translationMissing
What secret passage?~|~translationMissing
Get the cat away from me first and then I'll tell you.~|~translationMissing
You pick up your cat.~|~translationMissing
Okay, now where is this passage?~|~translationMissing
It's by that group of rocks just to the north east, but you won't be able to enter. Well, not yet anyway...~|~translationMissing
Where does it lead to?~|~translationMissing
To Sophanem, the city of the dead.~|~translationMissing
The second city of the Menaphites, full of giant monuments to their departed.~|~translationMissing
The place is locked down at the moment, so the passage is the only way in. Apparently, they've been hit by a set of plagues. That pathetic new High Priest of Icthlarin is probably to blame.~|~translationMissing
Interesting... Tell me about this Icthlarin.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Well fair enough then.~|~translationMissing
So why do you say I won't be able to enter the passage?~|~translationMissing
First bring me some supplies and then I'll tell you. I'm running low and I'm about to embark on a long journey.~|~translationMissing
Get me a full waterskin and a tinderbox. I seem to have lost my own and these desert nights are very cold.~|~translationMissing
Start the Icthlarin's Little Helper quest?~|~translationMissing
Okay. I actually have those on me already.~|~translationMissing
Good... Now, look into my eyes...~|~translationMissing
Look deeply into them...~|~translationMissing
Don't blink...~|~translationMissing
You slowly pick yourself off the ground. Your head is pounding, and an irrational sense of guilt nags you.~|~translationMissing
Ah, my poor head. What's going on?~|~translationMissing
How did I get here? That wanderer... This is her doing!~|~translationMissing
You notice a ghostly figure making pained gestures in your direction.~|~translationMissing
Klenter~|~translationMissing
Wooo wooo wooooo!~|~translationMissing
The spirit tries to converse with you, but all you can understand is his anger, which is directed toward you.~|~translationMissing
As you touch the pyramid door, a sense of deja-vu sweeps over you...~|~translationMissing
I must go to the heart of the pyramid... The mistress commands it...~|~translationMissing
(End of flashback.)~|~translationMissing
I remember! That wanderer, she hypnotised me!~|~translationMissing
But... I can't remember why. I needed to get... something. This is so confusing...~|~translationMissing
Maybe someone around here can tell me what on Gielinor is going on.~|~translationMissing
The Sphinx ignores you.~|~translationMissing
Ah, how interesting... a cat. Come here to me, kitty.~|~translationMissing
Meow.~|~translationMissing
Your cat and the Sphinx converse in a yeowling language for a short time.~|~translationMissing
Excuse me. I need help.~|~translationMissing
Yes, your cat tells me you're in a spot of bother. Something to do with grave robbing, tisk tisk. So unbecoming of a guardian of cats.~|~translationMissing
Can you help me? Please?~|~translationMissing
Well, I have to say I enjoy a laugh at someone's expense now and again... so let's have a bit of fun.~|~translationMissing
I don't like the sound of this.~|~translationMissing
I'll help you if you can solve a simple puzzle of mine, but...~|~translationMissing
There's always a 'but', isn't there?~|~translationMissing
... but if you answer incorrectly, I get to keep your cat.~|~translationMissing
Okay, that sounds fair.~|~translationMissing
A husband and wife have six sons and each son has one sister. How many people are in the family?~|~translationMissing
7.~|~translationMissing
9.~|~translationMissing
Totally positive.~|~translationMissing
Well answered, human. I guess you get to keep your cat.~|~translationMissing
Now, will you help me?~|~translationMissing
With your grave robbing problem?~|~translationMissing
I didn't rob anybody's grave!~|~translationMissing
Too true, you didn't rob just anybody's grave. You managed to rob the grave of Klenter, the recently deceased High Priest of Icthlarin. Do you know what that means?~|~translationMissing
Icthlarin is the Menaphite god of the dead. By desecrating the tomb of one of his priests, you've made an enemy out of every person in this city.~|~translationMissing
But I didn't desecrate any tomb! There's no proof!~|~translationMissing
Really? Because if I'm not mistaken, that's Klenter's shade right over there. He definitely doesn't seem happy with you. There's also the burial jar in your possession. How do you explain that?~|~translationMissing
How did you know about the burial jar?~|~translationMissing
I can smell the rotting organs from here.~|~translationMissing
Look, I don't know exactly what happened. All I know is that wanderer hypnotised me and had me steal something from this pyramid.~|~translationMissing
The burial jar?~|~translationMissing
I... I guess so. It's all still very unclear.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. I'm afraid I can't help you. I have my own concerns without involving myself with petty human affairs.~|~translationMissing
However, I suggest you seek out the new High Priest of Icthlarin to the south east. He might be able to assist you. Of course, you'll need to convince him to talk to you first.~|~translationMissing
Here, I have a token that he will know is from me. Take that to him, and I'm sure he will speak with you.~|~translationMissing
The Sphinx gives you a token.~|~translationMissing
Thanks... I guess.~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I don't want to risk my cat.~|~translationMissing
12.~|~translationMissing
14.~|~translationMissing
I don't want to risk my cat.~|~translationMissing
I am an agent of neither good nor evil. I am unconcerned with the plight of mankind and their petty wars and beliefs.~|~translationMissing
Well, now that you've told me what you're not, can you perhaps tell me what you are?~|~translationMissing
I am the guardian of feline kind.~|~translationMissing
Why would they need a guardian?~|~translationMissing
Cats play a significant role in the religion of this area, particularly when it comes to guarding the dead from the Devourer.~|~translationMissing
The Devourer?~|~translationMissing
She's the very incarnation of destruction.~|~translationMissing
What understanding do you have of the Menaphite gods?~|~translationMissing
Little to none.~|~translationMissing
Well the Menaphite Pantheon is made up of four main deities.~|~translationMissing
The two main gods of the pantheon are Tumeken, the god of light, and Elidinis, the goddess of fertility.~|~translationMissing
Tumeken and Elidinis also have two children. Icthlarin is one, and the Devourer is the other.~|~translationMissing
They named her the Devourer? Not great at parenting, were they?~|~translationMissing
She was not always called such. She is known by her deeds now, rather than her name.~|~translationMissing
So if the Devourer is the bad sibling, does that make Icthlarin the good one?~|~translationMissing
That is the common belief, but things are rarely that simple. In some ways, neither of them are good or bad.~|~translationMissing
Icthlarin is the god of the dead. He takes care of the passing of souls to their next life. The Devourer is the goddess of destruction, and that is what she craves.~|~translationMissing
I thought you said she wasn't evil?~|~translationMissing
That's not quite what I said. Still, is destruction enough to make one evil? Fire destroys, but is that evil?~|~translationMissing
Um... no, but it also creates heat.~|~translationMissing
We could have an overlong theological debate now, but let's instead get to my point. Destruction has a place, so maybe the Devourer does as well. However, she has taken it too far.~|~translationMissing
The Devourer wishes to destroy every soul in existance, living or dead. As you can imagine, this has brought her into conflict with Icthlarin.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see where this is going. The cats are used to protect the dead from the Devourer, like you said earlier. But who protects the cats?~|~translationMissing
Well anticipated. The Devourer is terrified of cats for reasons I will not explain. However, her followers, although few in number, are not. I ensure the survival of cats. For this service, Icthlarin grants me eternal life.~|~translationMissing
So, then, you are a follower of Icthlarin?~|~translationMissing
Nothing of the sort. As I've said before, I have no interest in humans and their gods. I look after my kind. For that, Icthlarin looks after me.~|~translationMissing
What's going on in this city?~|~translationMissing
I thought that would be pretty obvious.~|~translationMissing
Well, I could benefit from your point of view. You seem the independent type.~|~translationMissing
Flattery, my adventurer, will get you everywhere. But to answer your question, Sophanem has been struck with plagues.~|~translationMissing
More than one?~|~translationMissing
Quite a number. There's a plague of frogs to the west. In the east, you can also find locusts.~|~translationMissing
The cows have only been producing sour milk since the outbreak, and the residents have been struck down by a rash of spots.~|~translationMissing
The residents? There are a lot of living people here for a city of the dead.~|~translationMissing
Sophanem is called the city of the dead because the dead are brought here. Death plays a rather large role in the beliefs of the people and, as a result, the business.~|~translationMissing
This is all very interesting, but I've got to get going.~|~translationMissing
You! I will have no dealings with those who plunder the houses of the dead.~|~translationMissing
Wait! The Sphinx told me that I should talk to you.~|~translationMissing
The Sphinx? Is it possible? That contrary old cat has never done anything to help us. Prove it!~|~translationMissing
You hand the token to the High Priest.~|~translationMissing
Well this is... unexpected...~|~translationMissing
So what do you want from me, thief?~|~translationMissing
I appreciate it doesn't look great right now, but I'm not actually a bad person.~|~translationMissing
Well you could have fooled me! Good people don't rob from the dead!~|~translationMissing
It wasn't me! Well... it was, I guess. I didn't do it on purpose though. I was hypnotised!~|~translationMissing
Hypnotised?~|~translationMissing
Yes! There was this wanderer! She had me break into that pyramid to steal... a burial jar... I think. It's all still a bit confusing.~|~translationMissing
This is all a disaster! The plagues were bad enough, but now we've got hypnotised adventurers plundering tombs! I've only just started this job as well!~|~translationMissing
You do seem to be going through a rough patch. Do you know what caused the plagues?~|~translationMissing
We fear they are a punishment sent by the gods. Perhaps we have displeased Icthlarin in some way. Maybe I am to blame. All this only started after I became High Priest.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm not sure if I can help with your plagues, but I need to fix whatever mess I caused in that pyramid. Can you help me?~|~translationMissing
Oh, er... I suppose the burial jar you took must be returned as soon as possible. That will allow my predecessor to rest once more.~|~translationMissing
I can do that. Do you have any advice for me when it comes to the pyramid?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so... No wait! There is something important.~|~translationMissing
As with many of our tombs, the pyramid has magical seals to protect it from the Devourer, the goddess of destruction. The fact that you were able to get in before means that you must have a cat.~|~translationMissing
Well... yes. But how did you know that?~|~translationMissing
Cats act as guardians against the Devourer. I'm surprised the Sphinx didn't tell you this. As such, only a cat can open the pyramid door.~|~translationMissing
I see. I guess that makes sense.~|~translationMissing
Why is it so important that the jar be returned?~|~translationMissing
Well those jars are a key part of our burial practices. To remove one is to directly insult not just Icthlarin, but all those that have passed on to the next life.~|~translationMissing
Not to mention, it wasn't just any jar you took. You stole a jar from the tomb of our former High Priest! Why do you think his ghost is now wandering the city once more?~|~translationMissing
But what will happen if I don't return the jar?~|~translationMissing
Have you not noticed the plagues already filling our city? How long before Klenter calls upon Icthlarin to send a few more?~|~translationMissing
For all we know, the plagues we already have could be punishment for your grave robbing!~|~translationMissing
Hey, don't go blaming me for that. Those plagues were here before I even met that wanderer!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps Icthlarin foresaw what would happen and sent the plagues as a pre-emptive punishment?~|~translationMissing
You really think he'd do that?~|~translationMissing
I don't know... Icthlarin is a patient and forgiving god. It does not make sense to me that he would do this to us.~|~translationMissing
Maybe he's not the one responsible.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps. Either way, that jar needs to be returned.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me more about the plagues.~|~translationMissing
They started a few days ago. We have locusts in the east of the city and frogs in the west. The cows have started to produce sour milk, and all of us have become infected with some sort of pox.~|~translationMissing
Once it became clear how bad it was, Menaphos, our neighbouring city, closed their gates to us and everyone else. We closed our own gates soon after.~|~translationMissing
That can't have been an easy choice to make.~|~translationMissing
I didn't want to, but the other priests insisted. We had to stop the plagues from spreading. It seems that our choice was the right one. So far, the plagues have remained contained, but at a great cost.~|~translationMissing
Many of our citizens are trapped outside the city. Some are stuck in Menaphos, with more in other parts of the desert.~|~translationMissing
However, that may well be for the best. Without trade from other settlements, we've been struggling to even feed the few of us left in the city.~|~translationMissing
How much longer do you think you can last?~|~translationMissing
Not long. We need to find a way to stop the plagues soon.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me more about Icthlarin.~|~translationMissing
Icthlarin is the son of Tumeken and Elidinis and brother to the Devourer. He is the Menaphite god of the dead. He is responsible for ensuring the safe passage of all souls from this life to the next.~|~translationMissing
Here in Sophanem, we support Icthlarin in his role by making sure the dead are suitably prepared for their journey.~|~translationMissing
So is Icthlarin only responsible for those that die in the desert?~|~translationMissing
No. While Icthlarin is only worshipped here, his responsibilities stretch across all of Gielinor. He cares not for an individual's beliefs. All who pass on, enter his care.~|~translationMissing
I imagine there are plenty of people out there who have a different take on things.~|~translationMissing
Which they are welcome to. It does not change the facts.~|~translationMissing
You seem very sure in these 'facts'.~|~translationMissing
While most of the gods, Tumeken and Elidinis included, may be long gone from Gielinor, Icthlarin remains. His important role in caring for the dead means that he is still able to interact with us.~|~translationMissing
So you've met him?~|~translationMissing
Well... no. While he is able to walk among us if he desires, he chooses not to so as to respect our way of life. Not to mention, his role requires his constant attention.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me more about the Devourer.~|~translationMissing
Long ago, back when Tumeken and Elidinis still walked these lands, they had two children. Icthlarin, god of the dead, was one. The other was Amascut, the goddess of rebirth.~|~translationMissing
For a time, Icthlarin and Amascut worked together in harmony. Icthlarin would ensure most souls are safely guided to the next life, while Amascut would select a small number to be reborn.~|~translationMissing
But something happened?~|~translationMissing
Yes. During a great war over these lands, Amascut became corrupted. She was warped into the Devourer, becoming the goddess of destruction.~|~translationMissing
Since then, her only goal has been to devour every soul in existence, both living and dead.~|~translationMissing
The Sphinx told me something similar, but her interpretation was a bit different.~|~translationMissing
We here have a lot of respect for the Sphinx. However, you should be careful of her words. She does not know the gods like we priests do.~|~translationMissing
So is the Devourer still around?~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately so. Most gods have long since left this world. However, the Devourer was able to find a way to remain.~|~translationMissing
Luckily for us, some of her former priestesses were able to weaken her, but she still poses a great threat.~|~translationMissing
Hey puss! What do you reckon about that cat on the door? Do you think you can open it?~|~translationMissing
Meeeow.~|~translationMissing
As you go to make the jump, another sense of deja-vu sweeps over you...~|~translationMissing
I need to get the burial jar for the mistress...~|~translationMissing
Apparition~|~translationMissing
You will not defile this place!~|~translationMissing
(The player defeats a ghostly apparition.)~|~translationMissing
You take the burial jar.~|~translationMissing
So I really did steal the jar. I need to return it as fast as I can.~|~translationMissing
(The player puts the canopic jar back where they found it.)~|~translationMissing
Have you managed to return the jar yet?~|~translationMissing
It's done.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Now we can prepare for the ceremony.~|~translationMissing
Er... ceremony?~|~translationMissing
The ceremony to reconsecrate Klenter's tomb of course!~|~translationMissing
It would have been nice for you to mention this earlier.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, with all this plague business, it must have slipped my mind.~|~translationMissing
You're the High Priest of Icthlarin, but you forgot a key ceremony?~|~translationMissing
Well if you want to try running a city with multiple plagues, you're welcome to take over.~|~translationMissing
That's not what I... Never mind.~|~translationMissing
Good. Now, this ceremony is very dangerous, so we must ensure everything is done correctly.~|~translationMissing
Dangerous? How?~|~translationMissing
Well the pyramid has these magical seals on it...~|~translationMissing
... to protect it from the Devourer. Yes, you told me earlier.~|~translationMissing
Right! Of course I did. Well for us to properly reconsecrate the tomb, we must first remove those seals. That means that once we begin, the pyramid will be vulnerable until the ceremony is complete.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see.~|~translationMissing
Now, we made many of the preparations while you were gone, but the carpenter and the embalmer could both use a hand. Could you go and speak with them?~|~translationMissing
Why do I have to help?~|~translationMissing
Did you forget that this is all your fault?~|~translationMissing
I guess I assumed that by returning the jar I stole, my job would be done.~|~translationMissing
The job will be done when Klenter is at rest once more.~|~translationMissing
Besides, thanks to the plagues, we're not allowing people to leave the city. However, as you seem to be unaffected, I've told the guards to make an exception for you.~|~translationMissing
And that means I'm best placed to help. Fine. The carpenter and the embalmer, did you say?~|~translationMissing
That's right. We need the carpenter to create a new holy symbol for the ceremony. He lives over to the east. The embalmer also needs help gathering some supplies. He lives just south of here.~|~translationMissing
Embalmer~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you. I hear you're helping us now. To be honest, I'm still not thrilled to have you around, but so be it.~|~translationMissing
I guess that's probably the best I can ask for, given the situation. Anyway, the High Priest said you needed help gathering some supplies for the ceremony.~|~translationMissing
That's right. I need three things, but the quarantine is making some of them hard to obtain.~|~translationMissing
First, I need some salt. Normally I get mine from the salt lake just north of the city. Just fill a bucket from the lake and then use the suntrap outside to separate the salt from the water.~|~translationMissing
Next, I need some tree sap. You can use a knife to extract some from a tree, but make sure you have a bucket ready. Most coniferous evergreen trees should have some. They're the cone-shaped ones.~|~translationMissing
Finally, I need some linen. That one shouldn't be too hard. The local cloth salesman should have some.~|~translationMissing
Handing in the sap~|~translationMissing
You hand a bucket of sap to the embalmer.~|~translationMissing
Well that was unexpected. Thank you.~|~translationMissing
Handing in the salt~|~translationMissing
You hand some salt to the embalmer.~|~translationMissing
Handing in the linen~|~translationMissing
You hand a sheet of linen to the embalmer.~|~translationMissing
After handing in all items~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I think that's everything I need.~|~translationMissing
Great. I guess I'll go and see the carpenter then.~|~translationMissing
Raetul~|~translationMissing
Good afternoon.~|~translationMissing
Is it?~|~translationMissing
It's hot and sunny, which is good enough for me. So can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
I've met with the town's embalmer and he mentioned that he needed a few things, linen being one of them.~|~translationMissing
Of course. That will be 30 coins please and thank you.~|~translationMissing
The merchant takes your money and hands you a sheet of linen before you realise that a transaction has been agreed.~|~translationMissing
Do come again.~|~translationMissing
You pour the water into the suntrap and it quickly evaporates, leaving you with a pile of salt.~|~translationMissing
Carpenter~|~translationMissing
Hello, adventurer. The High Priest says that you're here to help us.~|~translationMissing
That's right. He asked me to come and speak to you about a holy symbol for the ceremony.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, it needs to be made from willow. Thing is, there's a small problem with that.~|~translationMissing
Is this the part where you need me to get you something?~|~translationMissing
Wow, you're quick. I'm all out of willow, and due to the quarantine, I'm unable to leave the city to get more. However, the High Priest mentioned that a special exception has been made for you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has willow logs with them~|~translationMissing
Well there's actually no need for me to go anywhere. I already have some willow logs here.~|~translationMissing
You give the carpenter some willow logs.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Now, just give me a moment...~|~translationMissing
There we go. All done.~|~translationMissing
The carpenter gives you a holy symbol.~|~translationMissing
I imagine the High Priest will be down in the pyramid by now. You should take that to him as soon as possible.~|~translationMissing
Will do. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hey puss! Think you can open this door again?~|~translationMissing
I need to hide the mistress's symbol in the ceremonial room...~|~translationMissing
If the player uses the unholy symbol on the ceremonial table~|~translationMissing
No... It must be somewhere more secret...~|~translationMissing
If the player uses the unholy symbol on a sarcophagus~|~translationMissing
You hide the unholy symbol in the sarcophagus.~|~translationMissing
Yes... Now the mistress can enter the pyramid whenever she pleases...~|~translationMissing
The wanderer! She's going to attack the ceremony! I need to warn them!~|~translationMissing
Ah there you are. Do you have the holy symbol?~|~translationMissing
Wait! We can't begin the ceremony!~|~translationMissing
What? But we've already started.~|~translationMissing
But the wanderer is coming!~|~translationMissing
(The wanderer teleports into the chamber.)~|~translationMissing
You have done well, adventurer. All my brother's dogs in one place, with no one around to save them.~|~translationMissing
It can't be... It's the Devourer!~|~translationMissing
Amascut~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, kill these pathetic priests.~|~translationMissing
I'm not your slave any more!~|~translationMissing
Shame. Not to worry though, I have plenty more.~|~translationMissing
You! Priest of the dog lord. You are now mine. Kill your brethren!~|~translationMissing
Possessed Priest~|~translationMissing
Yes mistress...~|~translationMissing
Have fun...~|~translationMissing
(The Devourer teleports away.)~|~translationMissing
Protect us, adventurer! We must complete the ceremony!~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much, adventurer. Thanks to you, we were able to complete the ceremony.~|~translationMissing
Well it was the least I could do. After all, it was sort of my fault all this happened.~|~translationMissing
Well on that note, what exactly did happen there? That was the Devourer!~|~translationMissing
It seems the wanderer that hypnotised me was actually the Devourer all along.~|~translationMissing
I'm guessing the reason she had me steal that burial jar was because she knew you'd have to gather here to reconsecrate the tomb again.~|~translationMissing
She wanted to kill us all in one go?~|~translationMissing
Yes, and she had me plant an unholy symbol here to allow her to teleport right in.~|~translationMissing
Well once again, thank you. Without you, the Devourer would have struck a devastating blow against Icthlarin.~|~translationMissing
Here's that holy symbol, by the way.~|~translationMissing
You give the holy symbol to the High Priest.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. We wouldn't have been able to complete the ceremony without that in our presence.~|~translationMissing
We have a few things to finish here, but then we'll head back up into the city. Please join us there.~|~translationMissing
All of a sudden, a final sense of deja-vu sweeps over you...~|~translationMissing
Icthlarin~|~translationMissing
I must do as the mistress commands...~|~translationMissing
Did my sister really think that I would not sense her presence here?~|~translationMissing
Amascut! Release your hold on this human!~|~translationMissing
Argh...~|~translationMissing
Well I guess that explains why Amascut's control over me was broken. Not every day the god of the dead comes to your rescue.~|~translationMissing
Ah, there you are. You were gone for quite a while. As a thank you for what you've done, I have a little trinket for you. I'm sure you'll get a huge amount of enjoyment out of it.~|~translationMissing
(The High Priest rewards the player with the Amulet of Catspeak.)~|~translationMissing
So what do you plan to do now?~|~translationMissing
Well now that we've sorted out this business with Klenter, we can properly focus on dealing with these plagues.~|~translationMissing
And how's that looking?~|~translationMissing
Not great. However, we do have one bit of good news in that area, thanks to you.~|~translationMissing
When the plagues first started, Menaphos, our neighbouring city, closed their gates as well. Many of our citizens became trapped there when they did.~|~translationMissing
You'd think so, but they believe there is still a danger. It seems they're even willing to kill if it helps keep their city isolated.~|~translationMissing

Wizard Mizgog~|~translationMissing
Give me a quest what?~|~translationMissing
Give me a quest please.~|~translationMissing
Well seeing as you asked nicely... I could do with some help.~|~translationMissing
The wizard Grayzag next door decided he didn't like me so he enlisted an army of hundreds of imps.~|~translationMissing
These imps stole all sorts of my things. Most of these things I don't really care about, just eggs and balls of string and things.~|~translationMissing
But they stole my four magical beads. There was a red one, a yellow one, a black one, and a white one.~|~translationMissing
These imps have now spread out all over the kingdom. Could you get my beads back for me?~|~translationMissing
Start the Imp Catcher quest?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has all four beads in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Well this is a surprising turn of events!~|~translationMissing
Well I just so happen to have all of those beads on me!~|~translationMissing
Are you saying that you stole my beads all this time and I?ve been blaming these imps!?~|~translationMissing
No, not at all! I just found them throughout my travels and presumed somebody would need them at some point.~|~translationMissing
Bah! Fine.~|~translationMissing
(Continues in Quest complete section.)~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all four beads in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I'll try.~|~translationMissing
That's great, thank you.~|~translationMissing
I've better things to do than chase imps.~|~translationMissing
Well if you're not interested in the quests I have to give you, don't waste my time by asking me for them.~|~translationMissing
Give me a quest or else!~|~translationMissing
Or else what? You'll attack me?~|~translationMissing
Hahaha!~|~translationMissing
Just stop messing around and give me a quest!~|~translationMissing
Ah now you're assuming I have one to give.~|~translationMissing
So how are you doing finding my beads?~|~translationMissing
I've not found any yet.~|~translationMissing
Well get on with it. I've lost a white bead, a red bead, a black bead, and a yellow bead. Go kill some imps!~|~translationMissing
I have found some of your beads.~|~translationMissing
Come back when you have them all. The colour of the four beads that I need are red, yellow, black, and white. Go chase some imps!~|~translationMissing
I've got all four beads. It was hard work I can tell you.~|~translationMissing
Give them here and I'll check that they really are MY beads, before I give you your reward. You'll like it, it's an amulet of accuracy.~|~translationMissing
You give four coloured beads to Wizard Mizgog.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Mizgog places the four beads on the table and casts a spell on them.~|~translationMissing
The wizard hands you an amulet.~|~translationMissing

3 Asking Drezel about Ivandis~|~translationMissing
3.1 Talking to Drezel afterwards~|~translationMissing
You're back. Any luck in Canifis?~|~translationMissing
I went back to the place where I first met Vanstrom. He was gone though.~|~translationMissing
I feared as much. Worry not though. The day will come when we get our revenge on him and the rest of his kind.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, now that you're back, there was something I was hoping you'd help us with.~|~translationMissing
Start the In Aid of the Myreque quest?~|~translationMissing
Now that our base of operations is no longer safe, we're going to need to relocate before the vyrewatch descend on us.~|~translationMissing
Seems like a wise move. What part do I play?~|~translationMissing
To the south of Mort'ton there's an old town known as Burgh de Rott. The place was abandoned but I hear some escapees from Meiyerditch have made their home there.~|~translationMissing
And you want me to scout the place out?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. Head down to Burgh de Rott and see if you can find a suitable place for our new hideout. While you're there, do what you can to forge a good relationship with the townspeople.~|~translationMissing
I'll get it done.~|~translationMissing
Be sure to take a weapon of silver with you. You'll find it of great use if vampyres attack. Good luck to you.~|~translationMissing
If speaking again~|~translationMissing
Well met, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Head to Burgh de Rott and see if the town has a suitable location for our new hideout. While you're there, do what you can to forge a good relationship with the townspeople.~|~translationMissing
You'll find the town just south of Mort'ton. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Radigad Ponfit~|~translationMissing
Hello. I hear you're doing some important work for Veliaf. You'd best get to it.~|~translationMissing
Hey, how's it going?~|~translationMissing
Polmafi Ferdygris~|~translationMissing
Not so good. It's great to see you're helping us out though.~|~translationMissing
Ivan Strom~|~translationMissing
Is something new and exciting happening?~|~translationMissing
Maybe. Veliaf has asked me to do some work for him. Hopefully it will benefit you all.~|~translationMissing
The gate has been locked. Clearly the townspeople don't want visitors.~|~translationMissing
Florin~|~translationMissing
Get out of it! You're not having our food or our blood!~|~translationMissing
(Florin throws something at the player)~|~translationMissing
Get out of it! You ain't comming[sic] in here to get our blood or our food!~|~translationMissing
What on earth makes you think I want your food or your blood?~|~translationMissing
Hey! Don't try to sweet talk me. I know you want something! But we got nothing! Nothing!~|~translationMissing
What blood we've got, we're keeping for ourselves! You can tell that stinking Vanstrom to go suck a cow's udder!~|~translationMissing
And as for food, why we've barely got enough to feed ourselves. So you ain't having none!~|~translationMissing
This is our town! We live here. It's called Burgh de Rott, and you ain't coming in!~|~translationMissing
Where did you all come from?~|~translationMissing
We escaped from the vampyres. They had us trapped in Meiyerditch to drink our blood! Yuck!~|~translationMissing
What's Meiyerditch?~|~translationMissing
As if you don't know! It's that dark city to the east where humans are kept like animals to feed those greedy evil vampyres!~|~translationMissing
Sounds like an awful place! Let me in and I'll help you!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, okay then eh! No way! You can't trick me like that!~|~translationMissing
Why would I want your blood?~|~translationMissing
Your probably one of them stinking vampyres in disguise! You ain't coming in!~|~translationMissing
I don't want your blood!~|~translationMissing
We don't care. You probably want our food then, so you ain't coming in!~|~translationMissing
Why would I want your food?~|~translationMissing
You probably want to eat it all and we ain't gonna let you!~|~translationMissing
But I don't want to eat your food. I'm plenty healthy enough!~|~translationMissing
Well, that's as maybe, but yous probably wants to drink ours blood! And you aint having it and you aint coming in!~|~translationMissing
Okay, goodbye.~|~translationMissing
You gingerly place the food item into the chest.~|~translationMissing
The chest closes afterwards.~|~translationMissing
Blimey, did you see that? [He/She] put some food in the casket for us! [He/She]'s probably not after anything!~|~translationMissing
The towns people allow you to enter, curious as to what you put in the casket.~|~translationMissing
Drezel~|~translationMissing
Greetings again adventurer. How go your travels in Morytania? Is it as evil as I have heard?~|~translationMissing
Well done for bringing Ivan to the temple, [player name]. He will be much safer here.~|~translationMissing
Yes, it seems to be more dangerous in Morytania doesn't it?~|~translationMissing
Indeed it does my friend. But thanks to you and the Myreque, we have at least the hope of finding salvation in this dark and oppressive land.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf told me about Ivandis.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, how can I say this diplomatically. Veliaf is a good leader, but perhaps he shouldn't be voicing ideas about religious history.~|~translationMissing
But you don't even know what he said about Ivandis.~|~translationMissing
I assume he's made suggestions that Ivandis isn't actually buried in this temple? If he has made such a claim, it's not something I'm prepared to talk about.~|~translationMissing
So, you're sure that Ivandis is buried here then?~|~translationMissing
If you don't mind me saying, that is a bit of a redundant question. All of the Seven Priestly Warriors are buried here, including Ivandis.~|~translationMissing
So where did this rumour that he's buried elsewhere come from then?~|~translationMissing
Rumours come from all kinds of places. They are rarely true. I am sorry to be so blunt, but I'm offended that you challenge me on this.~|~translationMissing
What proof do you have that Ivandis is buried here?~|~translationMissing
Servants of Saradomin are not concerned with triffling[sic] matters such as proof. We have our faith, and our faith guides us.~|~translationMissing
So you don't actually know for sure that he is buried here?~|~translationMissing
Please, do not challenge me on matters of faith.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about the history of this temple?~|~translationMissing
I know that it is built on the site where the Seven Priestly Warriors defended Misthalin against the evil vampyres. I also know that their sanctified and holy remains rest peacefully beneath us.~|~translationMissing
Have you checked that then? Have you seen their remains with your own eyes?~|~translationMissing
Why would I need to? You'd have me dig up their blessed remains? For what?~|~translationMissing
Is there somewhere that I might get more information on Ivandis?~|~translationMissing
What little information there is, is probably already known to you.~|~translationMissing
So you have no further information on him that could possibly help me? Anything you know might be of use in freeing the poor people of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
I have told you all I know. That is as much as I, or anyone, can do.~|~translationMissing
If the player didn't exhaust other dialogue options~|~translationMissing
Will you let me check Ivandis' tomb?~|~translationMissing
Why are you so resistant to talking about history?~|~translationMissing
I am not resistant at all, my friend. I would happily talk history with you for as long as you desire. You do not wish to speak of history though, just rumours.~|~translationMissing
I think you're holding something back! We really need all the help we can get!~|~translationMissing
I understand that my friend, but digging up the remains of saintly heroes will not aid us in any way!~|~translationMissing
The lives of those pitiful few left in Morytania could rest on this!~|~translationMissing
And you know I would do anything to help those people.~|~translationMissing
I know. So please, help me as much as you can.~|~translationMissing
Very well, but there is only so much I can do. Remember that I am still a priest of Saradomin.~|~translationMissing
I know not if it will help, but please take this key. It will allow you access to a secret library here in the mausoleum. In there you may find what you're looking for, but I pray you never reveal this to me.~|~translationMissing
Drezel gives you a key.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Temple library key.)~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Drezel.~|~translationMissing
Very well then. Morytania is lost to ignorance.~|~translationMissing
Thanks very much for your help. I really appreciate it.~|~translationMissing

4.7 Finishing Up~|~translationMissing
Cyreg Paddlehorn~|~translationMissing
Hello there friend.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I'm guessing you're the boatman?~|~translationMissing
Well I am 'a' boatman. I don't know about 'the' boatman though. Why do you ask anyway?~|~translationMissing
I hear you have dealings with the Myreque. I was hoping to take some weapons to them.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.~|~translationMissing
Come on, I know you're in cahoots with them. It's important that I get these weapons to them.~|~translationMissing
Well... Okay, I may have done some work for them before. It's too dangerous now though. I'm sorry, I can't help you.~|~translationMissing
Oh come on, you can tell me!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I just can't... They're watching us you know... Eyes everywhere!~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess they'll just die without weapons.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, you don't seem too concerned about their welfare. I'm glad I didn't tell you where they are. In any case, they're resourceful, they can look after themselves.~|~translationMissing
They're resourceful folks, that's all I'm saying. The leader of their group, Veliaf, looks after them well.~|~translationMissing
Resourceful enough to get their own steel weapons?~|~translationMissing
Maybe they are... What do you care anyway? They've been up against it ever since they got started.~|~translationMissing
All of 'em have suffered more loss and heartache than you'll ever know. Now, leave me be!~|~translationMissing
What have they been up against?~|~translationMissing
You're clearly not from around here or you wouldn't be asking such foolish questions.~|~translationMissing
Drakan. That's what they've been up against.~|~translationMissing
Drakan?~|~translationMissing
Lord Lowerniel Drakan. Leader of the vampyres and ruler of Morytania. His reign over these lands means we all live in fear.~|~translationMissing
What kind of loss and heartache have they suffered?~|~translationMissing
The worst kind. Most have lost members of their family.~|~translationMissing
Take Sani Piliu for example. she was orphaned overnight when a vampyre went on the rampage. Imagine that, losing your entire family in one night. Terrible!~|~translationMissing
It sounds awful... Who is Sani Piliu?~|~translationMissing
She's the only female member of the Myreque. Her agility and light fingers have got them out of quite a few sticky situations.~|~translationMissing
If you don't tell me, their deaths are on your head!~|~translationMissing
There's death aplenty in this forsaken place... What do I care that some fool hardy vigilantes decided to go it alone against the Drakans?~|~translationMissing
Stupidity of youth is to blame. I won't carry it on my shoulders!~|~translationMissing
One mans vigilante is another mans freedom fighter!~|~translationMissing
One man's vigilante is another man's freedom fighter!~|~translationMissing
Aye, you can see it from both sides I suppose. But many of us consider it fool hardy to fight for something we'll never get.~|~translationMissing
I remember a conversation I had with Polmafi, a scholar, such as he was. Even he agrees that the chances are slim.~|~translationMissing
Polmafi? Who's he?~|~translationMissing
Polmafi Ferdygris is one of the Myreque. He's a technical sort and advises on all sorts of things to Veliaf. He was a scholar before he became a renegade.~|~translationMissing
What do you know of the Drakans?~|~translationMissing
They're the family that leads the vampyres. They're the ones to whom the blood tithes are paid. Too much I have told you already!~|~translationMissing
Ignorance is better than these truths I tell you! I can pretend once more that I am a free man and some relief from this gloom can I feel again.~|~translationMissing
Be gone with you now and leave me with my dreams.~|~translationMissing
What kind of a man are you to say that you don't care?~|~translationMissing
Don't dare to judge me young fool... what do you know of the heartache I carry? I want to help them! I did help them! But my part is done now. To do any more is to risk death!~|~translationMissing
You're risking death either way. Better to risk it and help the cause, than to stand by and do nothing.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Very well, if you would take your chance to help these strangers, who am I to stop you?~|~translationMissing
So you'll help me? Will you take me to them?~|~translationMissing
No, I won't take you, but you can use my boat.~|~translationMissing
You'll be going through Mort Myre though, so I won't be letting you go unless you've got some defence against the ghasts.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a druid pouch in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I don't have anything which I can use against them.~|~translationMissing
Well return to me once you have.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Druid Pouch in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You show the boatman your druid pouch.~|~translationMissing
I have this druid pouch! This turns the ghasts visible and I can kill them once I can see them.~|~translationMissing
Very well, you can go! But you'll need to bring me six wooden planks first.~|~translationMissing
What for?~|~translationMissing
The boat took some damage on my last trip. It needs repairing. There's also a bridge you'll need to cross later in your journey. It's rotten and will likely need repairs.~|~translationMissing
Three of the planks are for the boat and three are for the bridge. I suggest you bring some tools and steel nails along as well.~|~translationMissing
Here are some planks for you.~|~translationMissing
The boatman takes three wooden planks from you and uses them to fix his boat.~|~translationMissing
Right. You can take the boat. Just jump in when you're ready to leave.~|~translationMissing
Go as far north as you can and you'll arrive at the Hollows. Keep heading north on foot, over the rotten bridge, and you'll eventually reach an odd looking tree. That is where you'll find the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Why do you say that this place is forsaken?~|~translationMissing
All of these lands are forsaken of Saradomin's kindness, only cold death from evil do we now feel.~|~translationMissing
Those lucky ones to the west of the Salve little realise their fate if the river should one day become tainted.~|~translationMissing
I just want to help them, I think they need help.~|~translationMissing
I'll give you some cash if you tell me.~|~translationMissing
You think you can buy me?~|~translationMissing
Err, no. I just want to compensate you for your trouble.~|~translationMissing
You keep your money and I'll keep my secrets.~|~translationMissing
Aye, everyone in these lands needs help. I'm sorry though, it's just not safe and it's not likely to get safer any time soon.~|~translationMissing
Look, I feel for them, I really do. They're fighting the good fight out there and unfortunately, some of them probably won't live through it.~|~translationMissing
Ivan in particular I feel sorry for. He's the youngest of their group and he's seen too few winters to be involved in such toil.~|~translationMissing
Then tell me how to find them. I can help them.~|~translationMissing
I support their cause. That doesn't mean I want to die for them though. I'm sorry, but I will not risk the wrath of the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
Please. I need to know how to find the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I guess you're all out of luck.~|~translationMissing
So, will you take me to the Myreque?~|~translationMissing
Can I ask you some more questions?~|~translationMissing
Sure you can.~|~translationMissing
Where am I meant to be going?~|~translationMissing
Take my boat as far north as you can and you'll arrive at the Hollows. Keep heading north on foot, over the rotten bridge, and you'll eventually reach an odd looking tree. That is where you'll find the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more about the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
What do you want to know?~|~translationMissing
Why are they called the Myreque?~|~translationMissing
It's a name the locals gave them. It means 'hidden in the myre'. Nothing fancy, it's just because that's where they hide, in Mort Myre.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the members of the Myreque~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the members of the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Well you have Radigad Ponfit. He was a mercenary from Asgarnia but he joined up with the Myreque to settle some mysterious score with the Drakans.~|~translationMissing
Then there's Veliaf Hurtz, the leader of the group. He's been fighting the fight longer than any of them.~|~translationMissing
Next there's Ivan Strom. He's the youngest. I hear he's an aspiring priest. Not that there's much time for that around here.~|~translationMissing
You've also got Sani Piliu, the only female of the group. She's a bit of a shady one. I reckon she was a thief before the Myreque found her.~|~translationMissing
There's Harold Evans. Used to be part of some militia but was kicked out for being too hot-headed. Now he's the main fighter for the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Finally, you have Polmafi Ferdygris. He's the brains of the operation in many ways. Believe it or not, he used to be a scholar.~|~translationMissing
And that's all of them?~|~translationMissing
In Mort Myre it is. I sometimes hear rumour of more groups hidden in other parts of Morytania. Who knows if that's true though.~|~translationMissing
Let's talk about something else.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has asked a question (replaces 'I'll be back later')~|~translationMissing
) Okay, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Drakans.~|~translationMissing
They're the family of vampyres that rules all of Morytania. Lowerniel Drakan is the head of the family. Every bit of misery in this place is caused by him.~|~translationMissing
No one out here ever sees the Drakans, but their presence is always felt. Their castle towers over all of the region. A constant reminder of their tyranny.~|~translationMissing
I'm just a humble boatman. Cyreg Paddlehorn is my name. Like most of the Paddlehorns before me, I make my living by tacking the swamps of Mort Myre.~|~translationMissing
Curpile Fyod~|~translationMissing
Hey. What're you doin' here?~|~translationMissing
I've come to help the Myreque. I've brought weapons.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the correct weapons~|~translationMissing
It don't look like you have suitable weapons to me! Get out of here you fake!~|~translationMissing
(End of dialogue)[confirmation needed]~|~translationMissing
Okay, I see ya got some weapons. But here's da thing. These guys out here, they don't wanna be found. They paid me good money to keep em hidden.~|~translationMissing
Now, you seems all sincered up to me... It's choking me up right here. But hey, I's godda do my job or da kids don't get fed!~|~translationMissing
But I just want to deliver these weapons.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I's got an idea. Say I asks you a few questions and you answer them all correct and so on... Well that'd make me trust you's. How's dat sound?~|~translationMissing
Sounds fine to me... Go ahead, shoot!~|~translationMissing
Hey... Don't tempt me! You's dicing wiv death here my friend!~|~translationMissing

Curpile hits the player for 3 damage.~|~translationMissing
No reason!~|~translationMissing
Come on... Speak up! I may be able to help you. However, yous gotta know that your tresspassing and that by rights I should slap your around a bit. You know, just like as a warning.~|~translationMissing
I'm lost. Can you show me the way out?~|~translationMissing
You got yourself here... Now get yourself out... Quickly if I were you.~|~translationMissing
I have to go.~|~translationMissing
Sure... Be on your way stranger.~|~translationMissing
Back again? You ain't getting in 'till you answer my questions.~|~translationMissing
Well let's hear them then.~|~translationMissing
Okay, first question...~|~translationMissing
Wat ya still doing out here? Head through the doors behind the tree. Once you's in, take the first cave on the right.~|~translationMissing
Harold Evans~|~translationMissing
Hey! Who are you and why are you here?~|~translationMissing
It's okay. I'm a friend. I'm here to deliver some weapons to you.~|~translationMissing
Weapons? You'd better talk to Veliaf then. I'll be keeping an eye on you though, so don't go trying anything.~|~translationMissing
I'm keeping my eye on you. Nothing personal. We just need to be careful with newcomers. Anyway, Veliaf will want to speak to you.~|~translationMissing
Greetings! Good to see some new blood. You'd better speak with Veliaf. He's in charge here.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Here to help the cause are you? Speak to Veliaf. He'll sort you out.~|~translationMissing
Sani Piliu~|~translationMissing
Hi there. You're new here aren't you? You'd best go and talk with Veliaf.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hello. Sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be talking to you. You'd better speak to Veliaf.~|~translationMissing
You... I saw you come in. Harold didn't kill you though so I'm guessing you're no enemy. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm [Player name]. Don't worry, I'm a friend. I was asked to bring you some weapons.~|~translationMissing
It's true that we could do with some supplies. Thank you for bringing them here. I'll have a proper look over them in a moment but there's something I must finish first.~|~translationMissing
Feel free to introduce yourself to the others in the meantime.~|~translationMissing
Ah, well met. We'll discuss those weapons shortly. I need to finish something first though. Feel free to introduce yourself to the others in the meantime.~|~translationMissing
If first time speaking~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Forgive me if I seem cautious of you. We just need to be careful with newcomers.~|~translationMissing
It's fine. Do you mind if I ask a few questions?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to ask a few questions if that's okay?~|~translationMissing
Sure. I'll do my best to answer them.~|~translationMissing
What's your job here?~|~translationMissing
Cheating death seems to be my main role. I'm the main fighter for the group so I'm always in the thick of it. It's gone okay for me so far though.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about this group?~|~translationMissing
We're a good team, though many of the others haven't had any proper training before. I used to be in a militia so I've been trying to share my knowledge as best I can.~|~translationMissing
In most cases we end up having to improvise though. Thankfully, this lot are good at that. Ivan over there, he saved our bacon in a recent run in with some juves.~|~translationMissing
Juves? What are they?~|~translationMissing
Juveniles, the lowest form of vampyre. We come across them quite often around here. They may be the weakest vampyres but they're still very dangerous.~|~translationMissing
They're stronger and faster than many well trained soldiers, and twice as bloodthirsty.~|~translationMissing
What's your grasp of the situation?~|~translationMissing
The situation is grave. It would be dangerous to think differently.~|~translationMissing
We're really up against it, but we have no choice. This is a battle for our very existence and we need to employ any tactics to achieve our goal.~|~translationMissing
Have you heard any rumours?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I hear them all the time. I don't pay any attention to them though.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see you've introduced yourself to Veliaf. Are you planning to join the fray against the Drakans?~|~translationMissing
Maybe. I'd like to ask a few questions if that's okay?~|~translationMissing
Hello again! How can I be of service to you?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to ask you few questions.~|~translationMissing
Sure, go ahead. I'll answer as best I can.~|~translationMissing
I help with anything I can. I used to be a mercenary before joining the Myreque so I know my way around a blade. I've relied on Veliaf's sword arm many a time. I like to think that he can rely on mine.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about the Myreque?~|~translationMissing
We're the only resistance against the vampyres. We're seriously outnumbered though. Veliaf doesn't like to hear us saying 'hopeless' but that's our situation at the minute.~|~translationMissing
What're your plans for the future?~|~translationMissing
That's more a question for Veliaf. Ultimately though, our goal is to rid Morytania of the vampyres so that we might reclaim our right to exist.~|~translationMissing
For me personally, I hope that more people will join our ranks soon. Strengh comes in numbers after all.~|~translationMissing
I have. Something you might find interesting is that Safalaan Hallow, the leader of another Myreque group, has apparently managed to sneak one of his people into the vampyre capital, Darkmeyer.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure how true that is. It would be great though!~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see you've introduced yourself to Veliaf. Now, what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
Do you mind if I ask a few questions?~|~translationMissing
Salutations! How are you?~|~translationMissing
Fine thanks. I'd like to ask a few questions if that's okay?~|~translationMissing
Not at all. I'm sure I'll be able to help.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
I'm a key advisor to Veliaf. He seeks my council on many issues before we engage the enemy. Not that we do that very often. Our foes heavily outnumber us.~|~translationMissing
We don't give up though. After all, all that is required for evil to survive is for good people to do nothing.~|~translationMissing
Well there's multiple groups of us. Even we don't know exactly how many. The less we know about our allies, the less we can reveal to the vampyres if captured.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf leads this group. We operate throughout Mort Myre and the surrounding villages. He reports to Calsidiu who is the head of our resistance.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about Morytania?~|~translationMissing
All the land on this side of the Salve is known as Morytania. Humans and vampyres are the main occupants of the region, though other races also live out here.~|~translationMissing
The humans here live like cattle with the vampyres taking regular blood tithes to keep themselves fed. All in all, it's a dire place. Though we hope to change that.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I hear them all the time. They're neither correct or even all that interesting though.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Very nice to meet you! The name's Sani Piliu. What's yours?~|~translationMissing
I'm [Player name]. Nice to meet you Sani.~|~translationMissing
The pleasure's all mine! I've got a good feeling about you. I reckon you're going to do great things for us! You have a powerful aura. Sorry, that must seem really strange.~|~translationMissing
Well, perhaps a little. It's nice of you to say so in any case though. I'd like to ask a few questions if that's okay?~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello [Player name]. Nice to see you again! How's things?~|~translationMissing
Fine thanks. Do you mind if I ask a few questions?~|~translationMissing
Tell me a bit about yourself.~|~translationMissing
There's not much to tell really. I was nine years old when my family was ripped to pieces by a vampyre.~|~translationMissing
One moment I was a happy member of a loving family, the next I was an orphan living a hand to mouth existence.~|~translationMissing
Somehow I managed to get by, eking out a living wherever I could. People took pity on me and I earnt food by helping them out.~|~translationMissing
I quickly found I had a very useful set of skills and there were plenty of people willing to pay for them.~|~translationMissing
I bumped into Veliaf in Canifis. He saw that I would be an asset to the Myreque and invited me to join. I said yes of course. I couldn't turn down the chance to fight against those who took away my family.~|~translationMissing
Well Veliaf is the leader of our group. We're not the only ones in Morytania though. Veliaf reports to someone called Calsidiu who's in charge of all the Myreque. I've never met any of the others though.~|~translationMissing
Our hope is to one day bring an end to the reign of Lowerniel Drakan and his vampyres.~|~translationMissing
For now though, we're just trying to find any weaknesses we can take advantage of. We need to know how to kill them before we take the war to them!~|~translationMissing
You make it sound easy!~|~translationMissing
With determination you can achieve great things. However, Veliaf always tells us not to underestimate the enemy. I've made that mistake before. I won't be making it again.~|~translationMissing
What's going on in Morytania?~|~translationMissing
The entire region is ruled over by Lowerniel Drakan and his family. Everyone living here must pay blood tithes to the vampyres. The tithes keep the vampyres fed and ensure that people are too weak to oppose them.~|~translationMissing
That's where we come in. We won't just offer our family members to the Drakans as a weekly snack. We're going to fight back!~|~translationMissing
Is this your main camp?~|~translationMissing
It's our only camp! At least, for our group. I know there's more Myreque in other parts of Morytania but I don't know exactly where.~|~translationMissing
Hi there. Veliaf said that I should introduce myself to everyone.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Well my name is Ivan. It's nice to meet you.~|~translationMissing
Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello again. How are you?~|~translationMissing
Fine thanks. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?~|~translationMissing
That's fine. I don't know how much I can help though.~|~translationMissing
Me personally? I shouldn't be here really. I'm training to be a priest and I was meant to travel to Paterdomus to learn from Drezel. The trip's too dangerous at the moment though.~|~translationMissing
Is it really important for you to train as a priest? I'd have thought there'd be more pressing issues.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf thinks it would be useful to have a priest to advise him. I think he also wants me further away from harm until I'm more experienced.~|~translationMissing
We're the only ones brave enough to put up a fight against the Drakans. I'm proud to be one of them.~|~translationMissing
I do worry that I might let the others down though. I'm not as skilled as they are.~|~translationMissing
It's a lost land. The evil Drakan family rule all of the region. People cling to each other in fear when the blood tithes are to be paid. It's horrible!~|~translationMissing
It won't be like this forever though. The Myreque will bring light back to this dark place.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I haven't heard anything notable recently.~|~translationMissing
Well met. I see you've introduced yourself to everyone. Shall we discuss those weapons now? Or was there something else you wanted to talk about?~|~translationMissing
Let's talk about the weapons.~|~translationMissing
Let's see what you have for us.~|~translationMissing
If the player does have the weapons~|~translationMissing
You give the weapons to Veliaf.~|~translationMissing
These weapons look great! Many thanks.~|~translationMissing
Cutscene begins~|~translationMissing
Vampyre!~|~translationMissing
It's Vanstrom!~|~translationMissing
Wait... What?~|~translationMissing
Well done adventurer! You led me right to them. The little dears are going to wonder which side you're on!~|~translationMissing
The Drakans have been wanting you lot dealt with for a while now. We wouldn't want to disappoint them, would we?~|~translationMissing
We're dead!~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom casts blood barrage hitting and killing Sani for 30 HP~|~translationMissing
Quite right.~|~translationMissing
Sorry Harold, you too!~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom casts blood barrage hitting and killing Harold for 40 HP~|~translationMissing
And now... A little gift for the rest of you.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the weapons~|~translationMissing
Ah. I'm afraid you don't have suitable weapons for us. Sorry friend.~|~translationMissing
What weapons do you need?~|~translationMissing
Well we all have our own specialisms. We could do with a longsword, two shortswords, a dagger, a mace and a warhammer, all made from steel.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll come back once I have them.~|~translationMissing
So you're the leader of this group?~|~translationMissing
That's right. I can't say I particularly asked for it. The others look up to me though, so they decided I was the best man for the job.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me about your organisation?~|~translationMissing
Well I wouldn't say we're an organisation. We're really not that organised.~|~translationMissing
Anyway though, we're a group of Myreque freedom fighters. We're dedicated to mounting a resistance against the Drakan family and their vampyre kin.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about Morytania?~|~translationMissing
If legend is to be believed, it was once a beautiful place. But then Lowerniel Drakan and his vampyres arrived.~|~translationMissing
Who is Lowerniel Drakan?~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakan is his full name. He's the vampyre that heads up the Drakan family. Helped by his brother Ranis and his sister Vanescula, he rules over all of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
You sound very bitter.~|~translationMissing
So would you if you lost everyone dear to you at the hands of such monsters.~|~translationMissing
What are your plans for the future?~|~translationMissing
At the moment we're maintaining a low profile here at our hideout. We were recently spotted while out on a scouting mission so we're playing it safe and lying low.~|~translationMissing
Looking further ahead, we need to build more support if we have any hope of taking on the vampyres. We also need to learn more about their weaknesses, so we can take advantage of them.~|~translationMissing
Sani... Harold... That murderer killed them!~|~translationMissing
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand though. He said you led him here. How?~|~translationMissing
He was the one that asked me to bring the weapons to you. He looked like a human though.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry friend, but he clearly took advantage of you. Vampyres can shapeshift to look like humans. Someone from around here might have realised. You were not to know though.~|~translationMissing
No. I'm still responsible though.~|~translationMissing
The burden of what happened here is for your conscience to bear. That said, you managed to kill that pet of his. We might all be dead if not for you.~|~translationMissing
I imagine you now see why we fight for our freedom.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I think I understand. Is there anything I can do to help now? I first met Vanstrom in Canifis. I could go back and see if he's still there?~|~translationMissing
I suspect he will have moved on now. You're welcome to try though. I know a shortcut that you might find useful.~|~translationMissing
If you head back into the main cave and go north you'll reach a wall. There's a hidden door in that wall that leads right into the basement of the Hair of the Dog Tavern.~|~translationMissing
That's very useful. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
Once you are done, I'd appreciate you coming back here to discuss a few things. You held your own against that creature. We could use someone like you.~|~translationMissing
Need something?~|~translationMissing
I want to join your organisation.~|~translationMissing
Well we could definitely use someone like you. You should go and see if Vanstrom is still in Canifis though. Come back once you're done, and we'll talk.~|~translationMissing
What do you plan to do now?~|~translationMissing
We won't be able to stay here now that Vanstrom knows where we've been hiding. We have some time though. He'll expect that we're all dead. We'll use that time to form a plan of action.~|~translationMissing
How do I get out of here again?~|~translationMissing
That monster! He killed them! We'll make them all pay!~|~translationMissing
This is a dark day for the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
I'm so sorry for your loss.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry. No one blames you. You were tricked and that's that. It serves no useful purpose to blame any of ourselves for this.~|~translationMissing
Thank Saradomin you managed to kill that awful beast! I just wish we could have done more.~|~translationMissing
I'm so sorry for your loss. If there's anything I can do, please let me know.~|~translationMissing
I will. Thank you.~|~translationMissing
Hello friend. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.~|~translationMissing
Who did you think I was?~|~translationMissing
I thought you were that dirty murderer Vanstrom.~|~translationMissing
Woah! It sounds like you've got a score to settle!~|~translationMissing
I definitely have!~|~translationMissing

Trufitus~|~translationMissing
Greetings Bwana! I am Trufitus Shakaya of the Tai Bwo Wannai village.~|~translationMissing
Welcome to our humble village.~|~translationMissing
What does Bwana mean?~|~translationMissing
Gracious [sir/lady], it means friend. And friends come in peace. I assume that you come in peace?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course I do.~|~translationMissing
Well, that is good news, as I may have a proposition for you.~|~translationMissing
A proposition eh? Sounds interesting!~|~translationMissing
I hoped you would think so. My people are afraid to stay in the village.~|~translationMissing
They have returned to the jungle and I need to commune with the gods~|~translationMissing
to see what fate befalls us. You can help me by collecting some herbs that I need.~|~translationMissing
Me? How can I help?~|~translationMissing
I need to make a special brew! A potion that helps me to commune with the gods. For this potion, I need very special herbs, that are only found in the deep jungle.~|~translationMissing
I can only guide you so far as the herbs are not easy to find. With some luck, you will find each herb in turn and bring to me. I will give you details of where to find the next herb.~|~translationMissing
In return for this great favour I will give you training in Herblore.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, sounds difficult, I don't know if I am ready for the challenge.~|~translationMissing
Very well then Bwana, maybe you will return to me invigorated and ready to take up the challenge one day?~|~translationMissing
It sounds like just the challenge for me.~|~translationMissing
It sounds like just the challenge for me. And it would make a nice break from killing things!~|~translationMissing
That is excellent Bwana! The first herb that you need to gather is called~|~translationMissing
Snake Weed.~|~translationMissing
It grows near the vines in an area to the south west where~|~translationMissing
the ground turns soft and the water kisses your feet.~|~translationMissing
I am very sorry, but I don't have time for that.~|~translationMissing
I am very sorry, but I don't have any time for that.~|~translationMissing
Very well then, may your journeys bring you much joy.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you will pass this way again and you then take up my proposal?~|~translationMissing
But for now, fare thee well.~|~translationMissing
I am sorry, but I am very busy.~|~translationMissing
What does a warrior like me know about peace?~|~translationMissing
When you grow weary of violence and seek a more enlightened path, please pay me a visit~|~translationMissing
as I may have a proposition for you. Now I need to attend to the plight of my people. Please excuse me...~|~translationMissing
Tai Bwo Wannai? What does that mean?~|~translationMissing
It means 'small clearing in the jungle' but it is now the name of our village.~|~translationMissing
It's a nice village, where is everyone?~|~translationMissing
My people are afraid to stay in the village. They have returned to the jungle. I need to commune with the gods to see what fate befalls us.~|~translationMissing
You may be able to help with this.~|~translationMissing
You search the vine...~|~translationMissing
You find a herb.~|~translationMissing
Hello Bwana, do you have the Snake Weed?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have any snake weed~|~translationMissing
Please don't try to deceive me.~|~translationMissing
I really need that Snake Weed if I am to make this potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has grimy snake weed~|~translationMissing
Sorry, Bwana, that herb is so dirty that I can't even tell whether it is fresh. Please clean it first.~|~translationMissing
If the player has snake weed~|~translationMissing
You give the Snake Weed to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Great, you have the Snake Weed! Many thanks. Ok, the next herb is called Ardrigal. It is related to the palm and grows to the east in its brother's shady profusion.~|~translationMissing
To the east you will find a small peninsula, it is just after the cliffs come down to meet the sands, here is where you should search for it.~|~translationMissing
Not yet, sorry, what's the clue again?~|~translationMissing
It grows near vines in an area to the south west where the ground turns soft and the water kisses your feet.~|~translationMissing
You search the palm...~|~translationMissing
Hello Bwana, have you been able to get the Ardrigal?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have any ardrigal~|~translationMissing
I really need that Ardrigal if I am to make this potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has grimy ardrigal~|~translationMissing
If the player has ardrigal~|~translationMissing
You give the Ardrigal to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Great, you have the Ardrigal! Many thanks.~|~translationMissing
You are doing well Bwana. The next herb is called Sito Foil, and it grows best where the ground has been blackened by the living flame.~|~translationMissing
Not yet, sorry, what's the clue again??[sic]~|~translationMissing
You are looking for Ardrigal. It is related to the palm and grows in its brother's shady profusion.~|~translationMissing
You search the scorched earth...~|~translationMissing
Greetings Bwana, have you been successful in getting the Sito Foil?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have any sito foil~|~translationMissing
I really need that Sito Foil if I am to make this potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has grimy sito foil~|~translationMissing
If the player has sito foil~|~translationMissing
You give the Sito Foil to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Well done Bwana, just two more herbs to collect.~|~translationMissing
The next herb is called Volencia Moss. It clings to rocks for its existence. It is difficult to see, so you must search for it well.~|~translationMissing
It prefers rocks of high metal content and a frequently disturbed environment. There is some, I believe to the south east of this village.~|~translationMissing
You are looking for Sito Foil, and it grows best where the ground has been blackened by living flame.~|~translationMissing
You search the rock...~|~translationMissing
Greetings Bwana, have you been successful in getting the Volencia Moss?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have any volencia moss~|~translationMissing
Please don't try to deceive me! I really need that Volencia Moss if I am to make this potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has grimy volencia moss~|~translationMissing
If the player has volencia moss~|~translationMissing
You give the Volencia Moss to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Ah Volencia Moss, beautiful. One final herb and the potion will be complete. This is the most difficult to find as it inhabits the darkness of the underground. It is called Rogue's Purse, and is only to be found in~|~translationMissing
caverns in the northern part of this island. A secret entrance to the caverns is set into the northern cliffs of this land. Take care Bwana as it may be dangerous.~|~translationMissing
You are looking for Volencia Moss. It clings to rocks for its existence. It is difficult to see, so you must search for it well.~|~translationMissing
You search the rocks... You find an entrance into some caves.~|~translationMissing
Would you like to enter the caves?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll enter the cave.~|~translationMissing
You decide to enter the caves. You climb down several steep rock faces into the cavern below.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'll give it a miss.~|~translationMissing
You decide to stay where you are!~|~translationMissing
You search the wall...~|~translationMissing
Greetings Bwana, have you been successful in getting the Rogue's Purse?~|~translationMissing
If the player has no rogue's purse~|~translationMissing
Please don't try to deceive me, I really need that Rogue's Purse if I am to make this potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has grimy rogue's purse~|~translationMissing
Sorry Bwana, that herb is so dirty I can't even tell whether it is fresh. Please clean it first.~|~translationMissing
If the player has rogue's purse~|~translationMissing
You give the Rogue's Pursee[sic] to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Most excellent Bwana! You have returned all the herbs to me and,[sic] I can finish the preparations for the potion, and at last divine with the gods.~|~translationMissing
Many blessings on you! I must now prepare, please excuse me while I make the arrangements.~|~translationMissing
Trufitus shows you some techniques in Herblore. You gain some experience in Herblore.~|~translationMissing
You are looking for Rogues Purse.~|~translationMissing
It inhabits the darkness of the underground, and grows in caverns to the north. A secret entrance to the caverns is set into the northern cliffs, be careful Bwana.~|~translationMissing

8.2 Grubfoot~|~translationMissing
Please let me in Dorgesh-city!~|~translationMissing
Mistag~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but surface goblins are not allowed into the city.~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot? What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
[player name]! I so glad you here! You help me get into Dorgesh-city? I want talk to Chosen Commander.~|~translationMissing
Chosen Commander? You mean Zanik?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that her. I have dream about her, remember, before you come to Goblin Village. She Chosen Commander who lead all goblins to new age.~|~translationMissing
Generals still not sure, but Grubfoot sure. She Chosen Commander!~|~translationMissing
Mistag, why won't you let Grubfoot into the city?~|~translationMissing
Our laws don't currently allow surface goblins to enter. The council wants to extend a hand of friendship to their kind, but we have heard that they are a very warlike people.~|~translationMissing
Start the Land of the Goblins quest?~|~translationMissing
I'll take responsibility for Grubfoot. I know he won't cause any trouble.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... If you are prepared to vouch for him, then I suppose we can trust him.~|~translationMissing
Very well, Grubfoot. You may enter Dorgesh-Kaan, but you must stay with [player name] until you leave.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]! I promise I be no trouble.~|~translationMissing
Follow me.~|~translationMissing
I think I'll let you two sort this out yourselves.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]! Will you take me into Dorgesh-city now?~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pet following them~|~translationMissing
I follow you, but you should pick up pet thingy first.~|~translationMissing
I don't have time right now.~|~translationMissing
Will you take me into Dorgesh-city now?~|~translationMissing
I need to do something else.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I go back to wait in Dorgesh-mines.~|~translationMissing
I want go into Dorgesh-city, not go that way. I meet you back at Dorgesh mines.~|~translationMissing
So big...so many Dorgesh-goblins...~|~translationMissing
Chosen Commander...~|~translationMissing
You talk to her for me, [player name]! I too nervous!~|~translationMissing
What are you doing in the city, surface goblin?~|~translationMissing
I looking for Chosen Commander!~|~translationMissing
Commander of the guard?~|~translationMissing
He means Zanik.~|~translationMissing
Zanik's not any kind of commander. She'd never fit into a command structure, she's too independant.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I think I saw her with Oldak earlier. You should check his lab.~|~translationMissing
A surface goblin in the city? That's against the rules!~|~translationMissing
Mistag said that Grubfoot could come in as long as he stayed with me.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Carry on, then. But I'm keeping an eye on you.~|~translationMissing
I'm keeping an eye on you, surface gobiln.~|~translationMissing
I not make any trouble!~|~translationMissing
Cave goblin~|~translationMissing
What happened to your eyes?~|~translationMissing
Nothing wrong with my eyes.~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot is a goblin from the surface. They all have eyes that size.~|~translationMissing
Oh! Welcome to the city, surface goblin! What are you doing down here?~|~translationMissing
I looking for Chosen Commander.~|~translationMissing
Zanik? She's no commander... I think she's in Oldak's lab at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Eek! A goblin!~|~translationMissing
But... you're a goblin!~|~translationMissing
Yes, but a goblin from the surface...~|~translationMissing
I not mean any harm. Just here to see Chosen Commander.~|~translationMissing
Zanik? I should hope that fool isn't in command of anything!~|~translationMissing
Where is Chosen Commander?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Zanik is Chosen Commander.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Chosen by whom?~|~translationMissing
Big High War God! He choose Zanik to lead all goblins into new age!~|~translationMissing
The war god? Oh no!~|~translationMissing
It's okay! Zanik isn't in league with any war god.~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot, you probably shouldn't mention the Big High War God down here. He's not exactly popular with the Dorgeshuun.~|~translationMissing
A surface goblin? What are you doing in the city?~|~translationMissing
Miner person say I can come in.~|~translationMissing
Mistag said that Grubfoot could come into the city as long as he stayed with me.~|~translationMissing
That is somewhat irregular, but I suppose it is reasonable. Welcome to the city, surface goblin! What brings you to Dorgesh-Kaan?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, of course. I think she has been helping Oldak with his experiments recently. You should check Oldak's lab.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Hello, Zanik! There's someone here to see you.~|~translationMissing
Remarkable! You must be a goblin from the surface, correct?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I am goblin.~|~translationMissing
I recognize you. You were in Goblin Village, weren't you? You said you had a dream about me.~|~translationMissing
Yes. You Chosen Commander. Other goblins not believe, but I believe.~|~translationMissing
Why don't other goblins believe?~|~translationMissing
They say Zanik not true goblin. She cannot be Chosen Commander because she not worship Big High War God. Because she not think war good.~|~translationMissing
I certainly don't!~|~translationMissing
But does that mean she have no destiny? Perhaps her destiny to lead goblins into new age of peace.~|~translationMissing
That's an unusual sentiment for a goblin.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I thought all surface goblins thought war was good.~|~translationMissing
Most do, but not me. I see goblins kill goblins, humans kill goblins. I think, is this really best thing in life?~|~translationMissing
I not say that to other goblins. They kill me if they think I not like war.~|~translationMissing
What is the Chosen Commander?~|~translationMissing
So why have you come to talk to Zanik?~|~translationMissing
Goblin legend. Hopespear, long ago goblin, he have dream. He say someday Chosen Commander come, lead all goblins to new age.~|~translationMissing
Most goblins, they think Chosen Commander lead goblins to war and fight other races. But I think maybe not.~|~translationMissing
I have dreams that Zanik is Chosen Commander. Before you visit Goblin Village I dream about Zanik. And now, last night I have new dream.~|~translationMissing
What was this new dream?~|~translationMissing
To tell Chosen Commander about new dream I have.~|~translationMissing
Yes, what was it?~|~translationMissing
Cutscene begins, showing a distant, lush, foreign land with goblins.~|~translationMissing
I have dream of far-off land. It like no land I ever see, but somehow I know it.~|~translationMissing
It cool and wet. Ground is soft, big plants everywhere, red water bubbling.~|~translationMissing
I see goblins, many goblins. Goblins of all tribes, but they not fight. They have no weapons. They live in peace.~|~translationMissing
Then I see Chosen Commander. She stand at entrance to new land, she show way in. She lead all goblins on long journey to new land.~|~translationMissing
I never see land before. I see it only in dream. But somehow I know what it is. It Yu'biusk, Land of the Goblins.~|~translationMissing
So... What's Yu'biusk?~|~translationMissing
That goblin legend. Land of Goblins. Legend say long ago, even before war of gods, goblins come from Yu'biusk. Big High War God find them in Yu'biusk and take them to other lands.~|~translationMissing
Most goblins forget legend. Think only of war. But I think, if Zanik lead us back to Yu'biusk, maybe we have peace. Maybe we be safe from people who want to kill us.~|~translationMissing
How do you know your dream was true?~|~translationMissing
Yes, how do you know? Dorgeshuun scientists and philosophers generally believe that dreams are a way for the mind to sort through memories. There is no known mechanism by which they can predict the future.~|~translationMissing
This dream not like other dream. It so real.~|~translationMissing
What do you think, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
It's just a dream. It doesn't mean anything.~|~translationMissing
It not just dream! It true! I know in heart!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, Grubfoot, but wanting something badly doesn't make it true.~|~translationMissing
Even so... if there's any chance there might be something in it, we have to investigate.~|~translationMissing
I think it must mean something.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]! I know you believe me!~|~translationMissing
It's probably nothing, but if there's even a small chance there's something in it, we have to investigate.~|~translationMissing
So where is this promised land, Grubfoot?~|~translationMissing
I not know. Not know any goblin who know. But...~|~translationMissing
But what?~|~translationMissing
I should not tell! Not in front of non-goblin!~|~translationMissing
[player name] is a friend. You can tell [him/her].~|~translationMissing
I suppose...~|~translationMissing
There secret place. Secret temple to Big High War God. No one know of it but goblins. Priests in secret temple, I bet they know way to Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
But before I tell you where temple is, you must make promise. Promise not to tell any other non-goblins where temple is. If humans find out, maybe they attack, kill all goblins in temple.~|~translationMissing
I promise, Grubfoot. I won't tell anyone where the temple is.~|~translationMissing
If that is what is required to keep your temple safe, then I promise too.~|~translationMissing
[player name], you must promise as well. That very important.~|~translationMissing
I promise not to tell anyone where the temple is.~|~translationMissing
I trust you, [player name]. You save village from H.A.M. attack. Now I tell you where temple is.~|~translationMissing
It built long ago, on Plain of Mud. It sink into mud and now it underground in muddy caves. It far west of here, near place where many humans catch fish.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I've heard of a cave system to the west where many goblins live. That must be where this temple is hidden. I can make teleport spheres to take you there.~|~translationMissing
I can't go. I must get back to village before generals miss me.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's a pity. Just a minute...~|~translationMissing
Here, break this sphere on the ground. It will take you back to the Goblin Village.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I go now, but you must go to temple and find way to Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
Grubfoot teleports away.~|~translationMissing
[player name], Zanik, are you ready to leave?~|~translationMissing
I'm ready!~|~translationMissing
Then let's go!~|~translationMissing
Zanik and the player teleport to the Goblin Cave.~|~translationMissing
I'm not ready.~|~translationMissing
I'll wait until you are, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. What did you find in the Goblin Temple?~|~translationMissing
We haven't gone in yet.~|~translationMissing
Ah, well you'd better get back there then.~|~translationMissing
Can you teleport me to the temple again?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I buy a teleport sphere please?~|~translationMissing
I'll see you later.~|~translationMissing
Did you go to Land of Goblins?~|~translationMissing
The entrance to the secret temple must be around here somewhere, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Okay, [player name]. I'll meet you back at the cave entrance.~|~translationMissing
Goblin guard (1)~|~translationMissing
Goblin guard (2)~|~translationMissing
Dorgesh tribe?~|~translationMissing
Me hear Dorgesh tribe return from below ground.~|~translationMissing
You want get into temple, Dorgesh-goblin?~|~translationMissing
Yes please!~|~translationMissing
You goblin, you come in.~|~translationMissing
Zanik enters the temple.~|~translationMissing
Human! Where you think you going?~|~translationMissing
But you said we could go in!~|~translationMissing
No, we say Dorgesh-goblin go in. You human, you go away!~|~translationMissing
Humans not allowed! Only goblins allowed!~|~translationMissing
Go away, human! We already tell you not to come in!~|~translationMissing
Only goblins allowed in. If you goblin, you come in. But you not goblin, you stupid stinky puny human.~|~translationMissing
Humans aren't allowed inside. They let Zanik in, but not me.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... that is an interesting problem. But I think there is a way to get you in.~|~translationMissing
How can I get into the temple without being a goblin?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you can't.~|~translationMissing
What? But you said you had a way.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think you can get into the temple, but not without being a goblin. I have been in correspondence with some of the wizards who live on the surface. I know of one who might be able to help you.~|~translationMissing
They are known as the Makeover Mage. You should go and talk to them. I believe they live south west of the human city of Falador.~|~translationMissing
I can, but I can't afford to keep doing it for free. If you get me two law runes and a piece of molten glass, I'll make a sphere to take you there.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the materials~|~translationMissing
I'll have to go get some law runes and molten glass then.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the materials~|~translationMissing
The player is teleported to the Goblin Cave.~|~translationMissing
Never mind, I'll walk.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and see this mage.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. Did you speak to the Makeover Mage?~|~translationMissing
You really should. I believe they live south west of the human city of Falador.~|~translationMissing
Makeover Mage~|~translationMissing
Hello there! I am known as the Makeover Mage! I have spent many years researching magics that can change your physical appearance!~|~translationMissing
I can alter your physical form for a small fee of only 3,000 coins! Would you like me to perform my magics upon you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me more about this 'makeover'.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Sure, I'll pay 3,000 coins.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Cool amulet! Can I have one?~|~translationMissing
Can you turn me into a goblin?~|~translationMissing
Into a goblin? What do you want to turn into a goblin for?~|~translationMissing
I need to slip past some goblin guards.~|~translationMissing
Really? What are they guarding?~|~translationMissing
I promised not to tell anyone.~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, sorry I asked.~|~translationMissing
Can you turn me into a goblin or not?~|~translationMissing
I think I know how, but I've never deliberately transmogrified someone into another species before. It's a very risky procedure, and I don't want to be held responsible if it goes wrong.~|~translationMissing
How about I tell you the recipe so you can make the potion yourself. It's not too complex. You'll just need to take a toadflax potion and add some pharmakos berries.~|~translationMissing
Pharmakos berries?~|~translationMissing
That's right. They're quite rare, but have wonderful properties that help with transmogrification. Luckily, I grow plenty right outside. Feel free to take some.~|~translationMissing
Now, once you've made the potion, remember that the transformation is very delicate. It will reverse itself if you are in direct sunlight or if you perform a strenuous activity like fighting.~|~translationMissing
For that reason, you should only drink it in the area where you're going to need it. I'd also suggest you take off any pieces of armour or similar before drinking it, just in case the transformation damages them.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't want to be a goblin.~|~translationMissing
I just like goblins.~|~translationMissing
What a strange thing to want to turn into.~|~translationMissing
You can do it yourself using that potion I told you about. Just take a toadflax potion and add some pharmakos berries.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. Any luck getting into the Goblin Temple?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but I spoke to the Makeover Mage. They told me how to make a potion to turn myself into a goblin.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! You'd better head back to the temple and try this potion out.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to get into the temple please.~|~translationMissing
Why you talk strange?~|~translationMissing
Oh... Err...~|~translationMissing
Me want get into temple?~|~translationMissing
That better.~|~translationMissing
What your name, goblin?~|~translationMissing
No wait, I guess.~|~translationMissing
Is it [goblin name]?~|~translationMissing
Yes, me [goblin name].~|~translationMissing
Ha ha! Me knew me guess right!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pet with them~|~translationMissing
You not come into temple with that thing.~|~translationMissing
What thing?~|~translationMissing
If the player is carrying the pet~|~translationMissing
That thing you carrying! It look alive!~|~translationMissing
If the player has the pet following them~|~translationMissing
Goblin guard~|~translationMissing
That thing! That thing that following you!~|~translationMissing
My follower?~|~translationMissing
Me not like it.~|~translationMissing
You go take it somewhere else before you go in.~|~translationMissing
You go into temple now, [goblin name].~|~translationMissing
No. You guess again.~|~translationMissing
Actually, me no want to go in temple.~|~translationMissing
You go away then.~|~translationMissing
Me want get into temple.~|~translationMissing
You want go into temple, [goblin name]?~|~translationMissing
Actually, my name not [goblin name].~|~translationMissing
What is it then?~|~translationMissing
Preacher~|~translationMissing
You goblins listen!~|~translationMissing
This is what Big High War God say~|~translationMissing
Slay enemies of Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Enemies must die!~|~translationMissing
Not to run from battle!~|~translationMissing
Cowards must die!~|~translationMissing
Not to show mercy!~|~translationMissing
Merciful must die!~|~translationMissing
Not to doubt Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Doubters must die!~|~translationMissing
Not to make own plans!~|~translationMissing
Thinkers must die!~|~translationMissing
In beginning, goblins weak.~|~translationMissing
Big High War God make us strong!~|~translationMissing
In beginning, goblins have no commander.~|~translationMissing
Big High War God send commander!~|~translationMissing
In time of great war...~|~translationMissing
He send commander to lead us.~|~translationMissing
Now we have no commander.~|~translationMissing
But some day he send new commander!~|~translationMissing
New commander leads goblins to victory!~|~translationMissing
Goblins conquer all of world!~|~translationMissing
Then Big High War God return!~|~translationMissing
Me hear Dorgesh tribe come back from underground. Maybe now all tribes united, prophecy will come true! Chosen Commander come and lead all tribes to victory over world!~|~translationMissing
Me hear there ghost in temple crypt! No one see it, but sometimes they hear it. 'Wooo... wooo...' it say.~|~translationMissing
Me mighty warrior of Big High War God! Me find farmer working in field, and me attack! He so scared he run off! Then me trample on crops! This deeds of great warrior of Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Me glad me finally get to secret goblin temple! Me walk long way to get here, always in danger of humans. But now me here, me safe! There no humans here!~|~translationMissing
Me hate humans! When me leave temple, me go and kill many human children!~|~translationMissing
Shh! Not to talk in temple!~|~translationMissing
Praise Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Me have question.~|~translationMissing
Questions for High Priest. He the one that knows stuff.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing the correct goblin mail colour~|~translationMissing
You go away! Only [tribe name] tribe come in here!~|~translationMissing
If the player wearing the correct goblin mail colour~|~translationMissing
You can pass!~|~translationMissing
If the player is leaving while wearing the incorrect goblin mail colour~|~translationMissing
You are thrown out of the [tribe name] enclave.~|~translationMissing
If the player is leaving while wearing the correct goblin mail colour~|~translationMissing
High Priest Bighead~|~translationMissing
May the Big High War God fill your soul with the glory of war!~|~translationMissing
May the Big High War God fill your eyes with hate for his enemies!~|~translationMissing
May the Big High War God clear your mind of all thoughts!~|~translationMissing
May the Big High War God fill your heart with courage to die for him!~|~translationMissing
May the Big High War God fill your arms with strength to do his bidding!~|~translationMissing
Dialog continues depending on quest progress~|~translationMissing
High Priest Bighead says a line of random dialog shown above.~|~translationMissing
Where Zanik?~|~translationMissing
Zanik? Who is Zanik?~|~translationMissing
She Dorgeshuun goblin.~|~translationMissing
She Chosen Commander.~|~translationMissing
Chosen Commander? You have history mixed up. Chosen Commander come in future, not now. When Chosen Commander come, I know, and I not see any Chosen Commander today.~|~translationMissing
Oh... well she Dorgeshuun goblin.~|~translationMissing
Yes, there was goblin who say she Dorgesh-goblin. She have big eyes and she speak in strange accent. She ask about Yu'biusk, but she not pass test.~|~translationMissing
She not just not know answers. Lots of goblins not know answers. She start shouting crazy ideas about how war is bad and we not need gods.~|~translationMissing
Huzamogaarb guards, they grab her and they put her in prison in Huzamogaarb enclave.~|~translationMissing
How me get into Huzamogaarb enclave?~|~translationMissing
Only Huzamogaarb tribe allowed in the enclave. That not you. You wearing wrong armour. The Huzamogaarb tribe wear black armour.~|~translationMissing
How they get black armour?~|~translationMissing
They use dye to make armour black. Other tribes do similar, but in own tribe colour instead.~|~translationMissing
Yellow for Yurkolgokh, white for Saragorgak, purple for Horogothgar, orange for Narogoshuun, blue for Ekeleshuun and like said, black for Huzamogaarb.~|~translationMissing
Where they get dye?~|~translationMissing
Some goblins say they go to witch-lady in Draynor for it. Me hope they beat up witch-lady and take dye! That way of Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
You forgetful? I told you, guards put her in prison in Huzamogaarb enclave.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. Have you discovered anything in the Goblin Temple?~|~translationMissing
The goblins there have imprisoned Zanik!~|~translationMissing
Oh no! You'd better find a way to get her out!~|~translationMissing
Can I buy a teleport sphere please?~|~translationMissing
What do you want now?~|~translationMissing
Zanik! It's me, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
I turned myself into a goblin so I could get in here!~|~translationMissing
You did what?~|~translationMissing
Yes... Definitely one of my more interesting choices.~|~translationMissing
I'll say. You can tell me all about it later. For now, I could do with a bit of a hand getting out of here.~|~translationMissing
I managed to upset the high priest. He said he'd tell me about Yu'biusk if I passed a test on goblin religion. I don't think he liked my answers.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Dorgesh-kaan sphere~|~translationMissing
Clearly. Well luckily I have a moving-over-distance sphere here. You can use it to teleport out.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]! I'm sorry to leave you, but it looks like you'll have to find out about Yu'biusk on your own. Hopefully you have better luck with that high priest than I did.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll work it out. I'll see you back in Dorgesh-Kaan.~|~translationMissing
Zanik teleports to Dorgesh-kaan.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a Dorgesh-kaan sphere~|~translationMissing
Clearly. So how can I get you out?~|~translationMissing
I had a moving-over-distance sphere with me, but they confiscated it when they put me in here. They didn't even know what it was. They were just frightened that it might explode.~|~translationMissing
I'll look around and see if I can find it.~|~translationMissing
Is that you, [player name]? Do you have that moving-over-distance sphere?~|~translationMissing
The guards confiscated it when they put me in here. It must be somewhere nearby.~|~translationMissing
You're back! Any luck at the temple? Have you found out where Yu'biusk is?~|~translationMissing
Don't give up! I know you'll work it out.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. Have you found out anything about Yu'biusk yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you'll uncover something soon.~|~translationMissing
Me want to know about Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
That knowledge not for ordinary goblin. Only those who understand ways of Big High War God may learn of Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
I understand Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
Then you answer my questions, and we will see.~|~translationMissing
True or false~|~translationMissing
Those who do not believe in Big High War God, whether they goblins or other races, must die.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Why?~|~translationMissing
Big High War God commands it.~|~translationMissing
That right! It in commandments.~|~translationMissing
'Not to doubt Big High War God! Doubters must die!' This mean we slay goblins who not believe.~|~translationMissing
'Always to slay enemies of Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Second question. True or false~|~translationMissing
Big High War God chose goblins to be his race because goblins mighty warriors.~|~translationMissing
Really? Then how we come to be mighty warriors, before Big High War God find us?~|~translationMissing
We taught selves to be mighty!~|~translationMissing
Fool! Heretic! You guilty of sin of pride! Goblins teach selves nothing. All good we have come from Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Other god made us mighty.~|~translationMissing
You confused. Yes, in time of great war, some goblins serve other gods. But no one make us mighty but Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
Look around at how mighty we are! How we proud of war. How we never flinch from battle or pain or death. How we never surrender or show mercy or pity!~|~translationMissing
How could any other god but Big High War God do this?~|~translationMissing
We naturally mighty warriors.~|~translationMissing
Naturally? Let me tell you what goblins are naturally! We tiny, we weak, we cowardly, we love peace and not war!~|~translationMissing
All that is good, that is strong, that is powerful, we get from Big High War God! Go away and remember this!~|~translationMissing
I not know.~|~translationMissing
False.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Why you say that?~|~translationMissing
He chose us for other quality.~|~translationMissing
What other quality important, except that we great warriors? Get away, silly goblin! Too much drink muddle brain and give you strange thoughts!~|~translationMissing
Goblins not mighty warriors before he chose us.~|~translationMissing
That good! Goblins mighty warriors now, but that only because Big High War God make us so! Without Big High War God we nothing! Remember that.~|~translationMissing
Third question. True or false~|~translationMissing
Goblin leaders should be good at planning in order to win battles.~|~translationMissing
Big High War God rewards victory.~|~translationMissing
Even victory that comes through clever dirty tricks? Even victory that comes through breaking Big High War God's commandments? No. Not all victory honour Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
Big High War God teaches us to think for selves.~|~translationMissing
What? Where you hear that? You think for yourself, you maybe think stupid, dangerous thoughts. You maybe think war not good, or Big High War God not best god.~|~translationMissing
No. Do not think for self. Think only thoughts of Big High War God. His thoughts perfect, so if you think different thoughts, those thoughts bad.~|~translationMissing
That why Big High War God command, 'Not to make own plans. Thinkers must die.'~|~translationMissing
Planning is part of war, and all parts of war are good.~|~translationMissing
You confused. It true all parts of war are good, but not all parts of war are for goblins.~|~translationMissing
Big High War God not make us commanders. He make us soldiers, and send commanders to lead us. They make plans for us. We not have commander now, but still we must not make own plans.~|~translationMissing
That one of the commandments.~|~translationMissing
That right. 'Not to make own plans. Thinkers must die.'~|~translationMissing
Last question. Prophecy say someday Big High War God send Chosen Commander. What Chosen Commander do?~|~translationMissing
Lead goblins to promied[sic] land of Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
Lead goblins to promised land of Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
Yu'biusk? You have story wrong way round! Yu'biusk land all goblins come from. But there no prophecy that we go back there.~|~translationMissing
Lead goblins to victory over whole world.~|~translationMissing
That right! And war will end in victory and victory last forever!~|~translationMissing
Dialogue continues as below after answering questions.~|~translationMissing
Destroy world.~|~translationMissing
Destroy world? Why Big High War God want to do that? Then there be no goblins to fight for him!~|~translationMissing
Make goblins fight each other.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha! Big High War God not need send commander to do that! Only reason goblins not fight more is prophet Hopespear say not.~|~translationMissing
Big High War God controls outcome of the battle.~|~translationMissing
That true. But it true whether goblin leaders make plans or not. So it not answer question.~|~translationMissing
Goblins stupid and would make poor plans.~|~translationMissing
You call me stupid? Big High War God make goblins perfect! Big High War God tell us not make plans, but if we make plans, they be best plans ever!~|~translationMissing
Goblins not mighty warriors.~|~translationMissing
How dare you? You insult goblin race in holy temple! We mighty warriors because we worship Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Goblins like you, who say we not strong, you are thing that make us weak! Never doubt, never question, never think! That way of Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
They might lead us astray.~|~translationMissing
That wrong! No true goblin be lead astray by those who not believe. If goblin led astray, that goblin deserve to die!~|~translationMissing
I think you weak in faith, if you think you be led astray. You go now, think on this. Be stronger in faith.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Why not?~|~translationMissing
Big High War God command we not kill enemies?~|~translationMissing
You not understand Big High War God at all! You like filthy stinking cave goblin! Go away and think on how stupid you are!~|~translationMissing
Goblin should not fight goblin.~|~translationMissing
It true that prophet Hopespear tell us goblin should not fight against goblin. But Big High War God, he command that those who not believe must die.~|~translationMissing
To little mind, weak mind, this seem to contradict. But only if you not have faith. In Big High War God, there no contradiction.~|~translationMissing
We try to convert them instead.~|~translationMissing
Convert them? You stupid goblin! You not even know name of god. He Big High WAR God! We kill enemies, not convert!~|~translationMissing
That good. True goblin not want to understand. Fight and die for glory of Big High War God. Never ask question or have thought.~|~translationMissing
Is not for me then.~|~translationMissing
You ready to answer questions?~|~translationMissing
Same as above~|~translationMissing
You have passed test. Now I answer your questions.~|~translationMissing
Yu'biusk is goblin legend. Very old legend, from before this temple built. From before Hopespear the prophet. Even before great war.~|~translationMissing
Legend say that goblins come from land of Yu'biusk. Big High War God find goblins in Yu'biusk and bring them to other lands to train them as warriors!~|~translationMissing
Will goblins return to Yu'biusk?~|~translationMissing
Why we want to return to Yu'biusk? In Yu'biusk we weak. Big High War God take us from Yu'biusk and make us strong.~|~translationMissing
Where is Yu'biusk?~|~translationMissing
Me not know. Me think Snothead maybe know.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find him?~|~translationMissing
He old high priest in temple crypt behind me! He dead!~|~translationMissing
Oh.~|~translationMissing
Maybe me ask him next time me see him.~|~translationMissing
What? But you said he dead!~|~translationMissing
Ha ha! You not know, but since you pass test, me tell you.~|~translationMissing
When goblin high priest die, they buried in temple crypt in special magic way.~|~translationMissing
This mean next high priest can ask them questions, even though they dead. I just say name of high priest over grave, and he appear and answer questions.~|~translationMissing
Can I talk to old high priests?~|~translationMissing
No. Temple crypt is holy place. Only high priest allowed into crypt, and that me. No other goblin ever go in.~|~translationMissing
Crypt door locked by six keys, kept by six tribal priests. Priests only give keys to me. They never give them to normal goblin like you.~|~translationMissing
What Big High War God's real name?~|~translationMissing
Why there only six tribes in temple?~|~translationMissing
Me have no more questions.~|~translationMissing
You ask big question. Big High War God's true name not for normal goblin minds, but since you pass test, I tell you. His true name Bandos.~|~translationMissing
That name that ogres call him, that orks call him. That name that goblin priests call him on holy days. But normal goblins, you must show respect. You only call him Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
Goblin tribes are thing of past. Long ago, all goblins divided into twelve tribes. Dorgeshuun tribe rebel, so Big High War God punish them. Then there eleven tribes.~|~translationMissing
No other tribes disappear like Dorgeshuun, but over ages, tribes merge. Now most goblins, they not know what tribe they come from.~|~translationMissing
Sometimes, goblins who know what tribe they come from, they come here and make tribal enclaves. They colour armour different colours to show what tribe they in. But not all tribes here.~|~translationMissing
How me get into tribal enclaves?~|~translationMissing
Goblins show tribe by dying armour special tribe colour. Yellow for Yurkolgokh, white for Saragorgak, purple for Horogothgar, orange for Narogoshuun, blue for Ekeleshuun and black for Huzamogaarb.~|~translationMissing
You not wearing colour, you not entering the enclave.~|~translationMissing
Me have no questions.~|~translationMissing
Good. Goblins should not ask questions. Fight and die for glory of Big High War God. Never ask question or have thought.~|~translationMissing
Me want to take test again.~|~translationMissing
Good. Goblins must always remember faith to Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
Me have to go.~|~translationMissing
Then bring glory to Big High War God.~|~translationMissing
Aggie~|~translationMissing
What can I help you with?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What could you make for me?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Cool, do you turn people into frogs?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) You mad old witch, you can't help me.~|~translationMissing
Can you make dyes for me please?~|~translationMissing
What sort of dye would you like? Red, yellow or blue?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do you need to make red dye?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do you need to make yellow dye?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do you need to make blue dye?~|~translationMissing
Can you make black or white dye?~|~translationMissing
Black dye can be made by grinding up black mushrooms. That's dead easy. The mushrooms grow in some old caves and ruins.~|~translationMissing
But white dye? There's no such thing!~|~translationMissing
Then how can you colour clothes white?~|~translationMissing
Usually you can't, but with poorly-made clothes, it's possible to remove the dye. Even then, it's a very tricky process involving a special ingredient found in the gut of the Hemenster Whitefish.~|~translationMissing
Hemenster Whitefish?~|~translationMissing
Yes, found only at Hemenster, oddly enough. It's the place where they have those fishing contests.~|~translationMissing
If you fancy catching some, you should know that very specific bait is needed. Only slimy eels will work. I hear you can catch those in the caves below Lumbridge Swamp.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, if you do have something you want the dye removing from, just bring me a Hemenster Whitefish and five coins.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What other colours can you make?~|~translationMissing
You're welcome!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Actually, I am happy the colour I am.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Fishing pass~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a Fishing pass~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I don't have one of them.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do I need that for?~|~translationMissing
I need to catch a Hemenster Whitefish.~|~translationMissing
Whitefish, eh? Okay, since you've won the competition before, I'll let you in.~|~translationMissing
Could you remove the dye from this goblin mail?~|~translationMissing
That'll be five coins please.~|~translationMissing
You hand the goblin mail, whitefish, and payment to Aggie. She uses the whitefish to remove the dye from the goblin mail and then hands it back to you.~|~translationMissing
I don't have that much money on me.~|~translationMissing
You'll need to go and get a Hemenster Whitefish first.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I was just about to do that.~|~translationMissing
What goblin mail?~|~translationMissing
Oh, right. I'll go and get some.~|~translationMissing
That goblin mail is already white.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, so it is.~|~translationMissing
Priest~|~translationMissing
Listen! Whoever does not worship Big High War God, whether great or small, goblin or other, must die!~|~translationMissing
If another goblin tell you to worship different gods, you not listen to them! You kill them! All tribe kill them!~|~translationMissing
Kill peoples who worship different gods! Smite them! Destroy them! Do not show mercy!~|~translationMissing
Enemies must die! Doubters must die! These words of Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Remember, we holy people of Big High War God! He chose us to be special people, better than all people in world!~|~translationMissing
Big High War God not choose us because we many, or because we strong. We nothing before he choose us! But he take us from Yu'biusk with mighty hand, and make us strong!~|~translationMissing
Soon Big High War God send Chosen Commander!~|~translationMissing
I tell you truth! There some goblins here who not die before they see Chosen Commander coming with glory of Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Then Chosen Commander lead goblins into war as one army, and we kill every other race and all followers of other gods!~|~translationMissing
Then Big High War God himself return and sit on throne of bronze and rull over all!~|~translationMissing
Let me tell you story about Hopespear! He prophet of Big High War God! He very holy goblin!~|~translationMissing
When Hopespear old, he walking near Goblin Village, and little goblin children came out of village and make fun of him.~|~translationMissing
The he look at them, and curse them in name of Big High War God. Then monsters come and tear children to pieces!~|~translationMissing
May Big High War God give you faith!~|~translationMissing
Before you enter battle, clear mind of thought. Do not think about what you will do or what may happen.~|~translationMissing
When battle start, Big High War God guide your arm and fill your heart with courage.~|~translationMissing
Have faith in Big High War God. He rule all war, so whatever happen in war, it his will.~|~translationMissing
Goblins great nation in time of great war!~|~translationMissing
Big High War God himself lead us into battle! Then we crush enemies, we burn cities to ground, we kill every man, woman and child! Even animals!~|~translationMissing
Some enemies, we kill them so bad, now there no trace and no one ever remember them! That what happen to enemies of Big High War God!~|~translationMissing
Snothead~|~translationMissing
You beat me. What you want?~|~translationMissing
It long way away. Me not know where. High priest who come before me, he say that when goblins die we go to Yu'biusk. Perhaps he know where it is.~|~translationMissing
What was your predecessor's name?~|~translationMissing
Snailfeet. That his name.~|~translationMissing
You not goblin. Not high priest. So me attack.~|~translationMissing
What's it like being dead?~|~translationMissing
It dark. Very dark. And cold.~|~translationMissing
Snailfeet~|~translationMissing
You beaten me. Ask your questions.~|~translationMissing
Far, far away. Me not know where. But high priest who come before me, he say that when goblins die in battle, our souls travel to Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
Mosschin.~|~translationMissing
You not goblin high priest! Me only answer questions for goblin high priest!~|~translationMissing
Why me here? Me die in battle, fighting humans! Why me not in Yu'biusk?~|~translationMissing
Mosschin~|~translationMissing
You have defeated me, human. Ask your questions.~|~translationMissing
Far beyond this world. Long ago, the Big High War God brought goblins from Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
The high priest who came before me said that whenever goblins die in battle and their blood spills onto the ground, Yu'biusk is close and their souls can travel there.~|~translationMissing
Redeyes.~|~translationMissing
I only answer questions for those who are worthy! I had to test you!~|~translationMissing
All alone. I thought my soul would travel to Yu'biusk. But perhaps I was not worthy.~|~translationMissing
Goodbye, human.~|~translationMissing
Redeyes~|~translationMissing
Yu'biusk is far away. Beyond the icelands to the north, beyond the mountains to the west, beyond the oceans to the south and the deserts to the east.~|~translationMissing
But it is also close. Wherever goblins fight in the name of the Big High War God and their blood spills on the ground, Yu'biusk is close.~|~translationMissing
My predecessor told me that no living goblin has ever gone to Yu'biusk. If no living goblin can go there, then perhaps the dead can.~|~translationMissing
Strongbones. He was a mighty high priest and warrior of the Big High War God. It was he who learned the magic that allows us to be called up to speak with the living.~|~translationMissing
You are not a goblin high priest, so I had to see if you were worthy.~|~translationMissing
I had thought perhaps I would go to Yu'biusk, to fight in endless battles for the Big High War God. Instead, there is only endless sleep.~|~translationMissing
Good luck in your quest, human.~|~translationMissing
Strongbones~|~translationMissing
You have proved yourself the stronger, human. Ask your questions.~|~translationMissing
Yu'biusk is another plane of existence. No goblin alive today has ever been there.~|~translationMissing
It is many millennia since the Big High War God brought our ancestors from Yu'biusk, but the call to that plane is still strong in us.~|~translationMissing
If the barriers between the planes were ever to be broken, goblin blood would call out and open a portal to Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
His name is not important. He is not buried here. Before my time, priests were cremated, and their ashes scattered to the winds. You cannot talk to him.~|~translationMissing
You are a human, not one of the children of the Big High War God. For this reason, you had to prove yourself in combat before I could speak with you.~|~translationMissing
I cannot tell you. I no longer remember what it is like to be alive.~|~translationMissing
Goodbye, human. I am sure that the Chosen Commander will find what she is looking for when you bring her to Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
Sort of. I've discovered that Yu'biusk is another plane of existence. Apparently if the barriers between the planes are breached, goblin blood will call out to Yu'biusk and create a portal leading there.~|~translationMissing
Another plane? You mean goblins aren't native to Gielinor? That's remarkable. Think of the historical implications...~|~translationMissing
But how could we breach the barriers between the planes?~|~translationMissing
I know! The fungus ring in the southern caves! Didn't you say that had magical properties, Oldak?~|~translationMissing
Yes... that sample you showed me had very similar properties to Law runes. I believe that the fungus ring could create an effect similar to my moving-over- distance spheres.~|~translationMissing
Fungus ring? That sounds like a fairy ring. They're part of a big teleportation network.~|~translationMissing
Well that confirms it then. This fungus ring might be just what we need!~|~translationMissing
If the ring can create a moving-over-distance effect... then with enough power, we should be able to use it to break the planar barriers.~|~translationMissing
Then we just need goblin blood to call out to Yu'biusk!~|~translationMissing
Well I reckon we've got plenty of that.~|~translationMissing
I can't believe this! The goblin homeland! This could be somewhere safe for goblins like Grubfoot. A new home, free of war!~|~translationMissing
Could this be it, [player name]? Could this be my destiny? Could this be why I was marked by the Tears of Guthix?~|~translationMissing
We should see if this works before we tell anyone else. Now, I think I can create some apparatus to provide power to the fungus ring.~|~translationMissing
Come on, Zanik. [player name], will you meet us by the fungus ring to the south of the city?~|~translationMissing
Hey Zanik. How's it going?~|~translationMissing
Hey, [player name]. This is incredible! I can't believe we're really going to go to Yu'biusk, the Land of the Goblins!~|~translationMissing
What do you think we'll find there?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. All we have to go on is Grubfoot's dream, which isn't much. Still, not long now until we find out!~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you should help Oldak out with the machine. He wants me to stand here so that when the portal opens, it'll have a goblin right next to it.~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]. The machine is nearly ready. When I activate it, it will bombard the fungus ring with magical energy.~|~translationMissing
For this to work, we'll need to make sure the power is distributed correctly between the three circles of fungi. I need to handle the activation. [player name], could you please handle the power distribution?~|~translationMissing
The inner circle has a radius of one zurg, the middle circle has a radius of two zurgs, and the outer circle has a radius of three zurgs. You will need to distribute the power in proportion to the area of each circle.~|~translationMissing
Oldak! It's working!~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to black. You, Zanik, and Oldak arrive at a barren wasteland.~|~translationMissing
Something must have gone wrong. This isn't what Grubfoot described.~|~translationMissing
No, no, no...~|~translationMissing
I don't understand. What happened here?~|~translationMissing
We must be missing something. This can't be it...~|~translationMissing
Maybe we should look around.~|~translationMissing
Yes, let's.~|~translationMissing
I'll stay here and keep an eye on the portal.~|~translationMissing
You should have a look around and see if you can find out anything about this place. I'll stay here and keep an eye on the portal.~|~translationMissing
[player name]. We should head back through the portal. Zanik is waiting on the other side.~|~translationMissing
Don't go too far! I don't know how stable this portal is!~|~translationMissing
There must be something around here. It can't all be dead... can it?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but we haven't properly explored it yet.~|~translationMissing
This is really it, isn't it? Grubfoot's dream was just that, a dream. All Yu'biusk is now is an empty wasteland.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand... What happened here?~|~translationMissing
The Big High War God happened.~|~translationMissing
I thought this might be it, [player name]. I really did. I thought this place might finally give me some answers, but it's just another dead end.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, Zanik.~|~translationMissing
Let's have a look at what this box is, then let's go home. There's nothing here for anyone any more.~|~translationMissing
You and Zanik push off the cover of the strange box. Suddenly, Zanik is surrounded by energy emanating from the box.~|~translationMissing
What's happening? [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Zanik is sucked into the strange box.~|~translationMissing
Zanik!~|~translationMissing
The portal is closing! You've got to get back now!~|~translationMissing
Zanik...~|~translationMissing
The player quickly returns to Oldak.~|~translationMissing
[player name]? What's going on? Where's Zanik?~|~translationMissing
She's gone.~|~translationMissing
Gone? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
I don't know... She just disappeared...~|~translationMissing
No... Zanik...~|~translationMissing
The portal... We have to go.~|~translationMissing
Oldak enters the portal.~|~translationMissing
I'll find you Zanik.~|~translationMissing
The player enters the portal, arriving back at Oldak's lab.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not yet traveled to Yu'biusk via fairy ring~|~translationMissing
) What are we going to do about Zanik?~|~translationMissing
What are we going to do about Zanik?~|~translationMissing
We can only assume she's still in Yu'biusk somewhere. Problem is, I haven't been able to get the fungus ring machine working again.~|~translationMissing
So there's no way back?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps not. Still, now that we've broken the planar barriers between Gielinor and Yu'biusk, maybe we've enabled some alternate methods of transport there.~|~translationMissing
Those fungus rings would be a good starting point. Maybe you could use one of them to find another way to Yu'biusk. In the meantime, I'll keep trying to get the machine working again.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has traveled to Yu'biusk via fairy ring~|~translationMissing
) I managed to get back to Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
I managed to get back to Yu'biusk.~|~translationMissing
You did? Did you find anything there? Was there any trace of Zanik?~|~translationMissing
No, there was nothing.~|~translationMissing
Then it's just as I feared. It seems that whatever's happened to Zanik, wherever she is... she's on her own.~|~translationMissing
I will find her, Oldak.~|~translationMissing
I know you will, [player name].~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I need to go.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but it wasn't how you'd dreamed. It was a devastated wasteland.~|~translationMissing
Yu'biusk... Land of Goblins... All gone?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid so. And that's not all. Zanik vanished there.~|~translationMissing
Chosen Commander? She vanish?~|~translationMissing
Yes. A bright white light picked her up and then she was gone.~|~translationMissing
She not gone. I sure of it. Someday she return.~|~translationMissing

Hello there traveller.~|~translationMissing
What are you camped out here for?~|~translationMissing
What are you camped here for?~|~translationMissing
We're looking for Zanaris...GAH! I mean we're not here for any particular reason at all.~|~translationMissing
Who's Zanaris?~|~translationMissing
Ahahahaha! Zanaris isn't a person! It's a magical hidden city filled with treasures and rich.. uh, nothing. It's nothing.~|~translationMissing
If it's hidden how are you planning to find it?~|~translationMissing
Well, we don't want to tell anyone else about that, because we don't want anyone else sharing in all that glory and treasure.~|~translationMissing
Please tell me.~|~translationMissing
Looks like you don't know either.~|~translationMissing
Well, it looks to me like YOU don't know EITHER seeing as you're all just sat around here.~|~translationMissing
Of course we know! We just haven't found which tree the stupid leprechaun's hiding in yet!~|~translationMissing
If the player has lower than 45 combat and either 31 Crafting or 36 Woodcutting~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that one or more of your skill levels are lower than what is required to fully complete it. Your combat level is also lower than the recommended level of 45.~|~translationMissing
Start the Lost City quest?~|~translationMissing
Leprechaun?~|~translationMissing
GAH! I didn't mean to tell you that! Look, just forget I said anything okay?~|~translationMissing
So a leprechaun knows where Zanaris is eh?~|~translationMissing
Ye.. uh, no. No, not at all. And even if he did - which he doesn't - he DEFINITELY ISN'T hiding in some tree around here. Nope, definitely not. Honestly.~|~translationMissing
Help? What help? I didn't help! Please don't say I did, I'll get in trouble!~|~translationMissing
So let me get this straight~|~translationMissing
What? How did you know that? Uh... I mean, no, no you're very wrong. Very wrong, and not right at all, and I definitely didn't tell you about that at all.~|~translationMissing
Right... Well good luck with it.~|~translationMissing
There's no such thing.~|~translationMissing
There's no such thing!~|~translationMissing
When we've found Zanaris you'll... GAH! I mean, we're not here for any particular reason at all.~|~translationMissing
What's Zanaris?~|~translationMissing
What makes you think it's out here?~|~translationMissing
I don't think we want other people competing with us to find it. Forget I said anything.~|~translationMissing
Oh well. Never mind.~|~translationMissing
Don't you know of the legends that tell of the magical city, hidden in the swam... Uh, no, you're right, we're wasting our time here.~|~translationMissing
Do you know any good adventures I can go on?~|~translationMissing
Well we're on an adventure right now. Mind you, this is OUR adventure and we don't want to share it - find your own!~|~translationMissing
Please tell me?~|~translationMissing
Please?~|~translationMissing
PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE?~|~translationMissing
NO!~|~translationMissing
I don't think you've found a good adventure at all!~|~translationMissing
Hah! Adventurers of our calibre don't just hang around in forests for fun, whelp!~|~translationMissing
Oh really?~|~translationMissing
Why are you guys hanging around here?~|~translationMissing
(ahem)...'Guys'?~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah, sorry about that. Why are you all standing around out here?~|~translationMissing
Well, that's really none of your business.~|~translationMissing
Why are all of you standing around here?~|~translationMissing
Wizard~|~translationMissing
Hahaha you dare talk to a mighty wizard such as myself? I bet you can't even cast windstrike yet amateur!~|~translationMissing
...You're an idiot.~|~translationMissing
None of your business. Get lost.~|~translationMissing
So I hear theres a leprechaun around here who can show me the way to Zanaris?~|~translationMissing
...W-what? How did you..?~|~translationMissing
No. You're wrong. Now go away.~|~translationMissing
Found that leprechaun yet?~|~translationMissing
Hahaha go away amateur! You're not worthy of joining our great group!~|~translationMissing
...right.~|~translationMissing
Have you found the tree with the leprechaun yet?~|~translationMissing
No, we've looked for ages but haven't... Hey! Wait a minute! How did you know about that?~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the information!~|~translationMissing
...You tricked me. I'm not talking to you anymore.~|~translationMissing
Shamus~|~translationMissing
Ay yer big elephant! Yer've caught me, to be sure! What would an elephant like yer be wanting wid ol' Shamus then?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure.~|~translationMissing
Well you'll have to be catchin' me again when yer are, elephant!~|~translationMissing
The leprechaun magically disappears.~|~translationMissing
Hey! Yer big elephant! Don't go choppin' down me house, now!~|~translationMissing
I want to find Zanaris.~|~translationMissing
Zanaris is it now? Well well well... Yer'll be needing to be going to that funny little shed out there in the swamp, so you will.~|~translationMissing
...but... I thought... Zanaris was a city...?~|~translationMissing
Aye that it is!~|~translationMissing
How does it fit in a shed then?~|~translationMissing
...How does it fit in a shed then?~|~translationMissing
Ah yer stupid elephant! The city isn't IN the shed! The doorway to the shed is being a portal to Zanaris, so it is.~|~translationMissing
So I just walk into the shed and end up in Zanaris then?~|~translationMissing
Oh, was I fergetting to say? Yer need to be carrying a Dramenwood staff to be getting there! Otherwise Yer'll just be ending up in the shed.~|~translationMissing
So where would I get a staff?~|~translationMissing
Dramenwood staffs are crafted from branches of the Dramen tree, so they are. I hear there's a Dramen tree over on the island of Entrana in a cave~|~translationMissing
or some such. There would probably be a good place for an elephant like yer to be starting looking I reckon.~|~translationMissing
The monks are running a ship from Port Sarim to Entrana, I hear too. Now leave me alone yer elephant!~|~translationMissing
I've been in that shed, I didn't see a city.~|~translationMissing
I've been in that shed. I didn't see a city.~|~translationMissing
Ha! Look at yer! Look at the stupid elephant who tries to go catching a leprechaun when he don't even be knowing what he wants!~|~translationMissing
How do I get to Zanaris again?~|~translationMissing
Yer stupid elephant! I'll tell yer again! Yer need to be entering the shed in the middle of the swamp while holding a dramenwood staff! Yer can make the Dramen staff~|~translationMissing
from a dramen tree branch, and there's a Dramen tree on Entrana! Now leave me alone yer great elephant!~|~translationMissing
We're still searching for Zanaris...GAH! I mean we're not doing anything here at all.~|~translationMissing
I haven't found it yet either.~|~translationMissing
So you didn't find the entrance to Zanaris yet, huh?~|~translationMissing
Don't tell me a novice like YOU has found it!~|~translationMissing
Yep. Found it REALLY easily too.~|~translationMissing
...I cannot believe that someone like YOU could find the portal where experienced adventurers such as ourselves could not.~|~translationMissing
Believe what you want. Enjoy your little camp fire.~|~translationMissing
Hahaha you're such an amateur! Go away and play with some cabbage amateur!~|~translationMissing
I already told you. I'm not talking to you anymore.~|~translationMissing
Cave monk~|~translationMissing
Be careful going in there! You are unarmed, and there is much evilness lurking down there! The evilness seems to block off our contact with our gods,~|~translationMissing
so our prayers seem to have less effect down there. Oh, also, you won't be able to come back this way - This ladder only goes one way!~|~translationMissing
The only exit from the caves below is a portal which leads only to the deepest wilderness!~|~translationMissing
I don't think I'm strong enough to enter then.~|~translationMissing
Well that is a risk I will have to take.~|~translationMissing
Tree spirit~|~translationMissing
You must defeat me before touching the tree!~|~translationMissing
With the Tree Spirit defeated you can now chop the tree.~|~translationMissing

Hey! Don't call me outerlander! I'm known as the mighty [Fremennik name]![sic]~|~translationMissing
Lokar Searunner~|~translationMissing
Can't say I've heard of you. So they let your sort into the clan nowadays? Wow. Things have really changed since I've been gone...~|~translationMissing
You don't look like a Fremennik yourself...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I suppose that's true... I have been gone such a long time...~|~translationMissing
You've been away from these parts a while?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you haven't heard of the infamous Lokar, scourge of the northern seas?~|~translationMissing
Erm... no... That's you then, is it?~|~translationMissing
Forgotten already? Tch! I have no regrets about why I left!~|~translationMissing
Why did you leave?~|~translationMissing
As a young man, I learnt that the Fremennik way of life was too slow for me...~|~translationMissing
Oh, sure, every so often we got to go on big raiding parties, looting and pillaging the weaker islands around here for food and profit, but...~|~translationMissing
Well, after a while, that was all I looked forward to doing.~|~translationMissing
Growing crops, milking cows, catching and cooking food, the day to day activities of our life...~|~translationMissing
THEY'RE SO BORING!~|~translationMissing
No, I knew what I wanted to do, and that was attack innocent people going about their daily business, steal all their money, then spend it on wine, women and song!~|~translationMissing
Oh.... Kaaaaay....~|~translationMissing
So I ran away from Rellekka to become a PIRATE! It's way more fun. Plus you get to see the world!~|~translationMissing
Was the world good then? Only, you seem to have returned to Rellekka after all.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have returned here, but that's only because we're short on supplies.~|~translationMissing
I see. So where are you and your scurvy sea-dogs headed to next? Arrr shiver-me timbers!~|~translationMissing
You're trying my patience...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, got caught up in the moment.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Well, the rest of the group are at Lunar Isle at the moment. It's where the Moon Clan live.~|~translationMissing
The Moon Clan... I think I've heard of them...~|~translationMissing
I'd be surprised if you hadn't, they're the Fremenniks' most hated enemy!~|~translationMissing
They've been at war with them for hundreds of years!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Actually, that might be a problem for you then.~|~translationMissing
A problem?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, they're a really powerful race of mages. They'd read your mind and see that you're a Fremennik straight away, then probably turn you inside out and feed you to the birds.~|~translationMissing
Cosmic.~|~translationMissing
But you went there okay?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, but I think the Fremenniks are a bunch of losers. They probably picked up on that.~|~translationMissing
Look, I know a way you'll be able to travel there without, you know, getting killed and that, if you fancy a trip!~|~translationMissing
Start the Lunar Diplomacy quest?~|~translationMissing
Why not, I've always wondered what the state of my innards are!~|~translationMissing
Well, what you want to do is go and talk to Brundt the Chieftain and get a Seal of Passage from him.~|~translationMissing
A Seal of Passage? What's that?~|~translationMissing
Well, it shows that you're a diplomat for the Fremennik, so you'll have immunity from being killed and stuff.~|~translationMissing
It's an ancient tradition not to attack anyone bearing a Seal of Passage, because they're probably on a diplomatic mission. Or well connected with powerful allies. Either way, killing them is usually a bad idea.~|~translationMissing
So I have to try and bring peace to two warring nations who have been fighting for centuries?!?!~|~translationMissing
What? I never said you had to bother trying to do that, you just have to pretend like you might.~|~translationMissing
No skin off my nose if those losers want to get slaughtered by the Moon Clan, just more stuff for me to loot when they're all dead.~|~translationMissing
Well I will try. I am the mighty [Fremennik name] after all!~|~translationMissing
Yes....~|~translationMissing
So I just have to go talk to Brundt the Chieftain and tell him I want a Seal of Passage?~|~translationMissing
That's it? Because in my experience simple tasks like that always seem to take longer than I expect...~|~translationMissing
Yeah, just go over and talk to the chief loser. You might have to tell him some rubbish he wants to hear, but that's it.~|~translationMissing
Come back here when you got it, my supplies are loaded and I'm good to head back to our ship.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'd like to live.~|~translationMissing
Oh, so you're a loser like the rest of the Fremenniks then? See ya around, loser.~|~translationMissing
Well, 'bye then.~|~translationMissing
'Bye then.~|~translationMissing
Hey there [Fremennik name]. So you get that seal thingy off of the Brundt the Chieftain yet?~|~translationMissing
No... Not yet...~|~translationMissing
Well hurry it up, okay? I'm sick of this dump of a town, I want to go back to the ship!~|~translationMissing
Ask about a Seal of Passage.~|~translationMissing
Hi there Brundt the Chieftain. Could you help me out with a Seal of Passage?~|~translationMissing
A Seal of Passage? Whatever for?~|~translationMissing
Well, I've heard that there have been great troubles between your people and that of the Moon Clan. I was hoping to help. And so I need the Seal of Passage to show my intentions.~|~translationMissing
Ah [Fremennik name], many have tried, but The Moon Clan are by no means a sharing group of people. They do everything by magic, something we never use. But they are so secretive about it. If only they would share, we~|~translationMissing
wouldn't have to kill them all the time!~|~translationMissing
I will see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Can I have that seal then?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but you have no room to carry it. You should have thought of that before, [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
If you are to bring peace to our two warring clans, then perhaps it is best that you do...~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a seal of passage.)~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask for a quest.~|~translationMissing
I lost my Seal of Passage!~|~translationMissing
So you want another one?~|~translationMissing
Well... I would if I had space to carry one.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear...~|~translationMissing
Then you had better take a replacement and be less careless in future.~|~translationMissing
Ah, [Fremennik name]. How goes the peace talks with the accursed Moon Clan?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you know. Ongoing negotiations.~|~translationMissing
I see. Well, I don't hold out for much hope!~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you're confident in my abilities.~|~translationMissing
So you got that seal yet from Brundt the Chieftain? Can I leave this dump of a town?~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah... Well, Brundt the Chieftain gave me a seal, but I think I lost it somewhere along the way...~|~translationMissing
What are you? Useless? Go get another one from Brundt the Chieftain, and hurry it up, I don't want to be here any longer than I have to be!~|~translationMissing
Yup, I've got it right here!~|~translationMissing
Great! Then let's head back to my ship! You ready to go now?~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Yar! Let's be on our way, yar!~|~translationMissing
...Why are you talking like that?~|~translationMissing
Um... isn't that how pirates talk?~|~translationMissing
Only the very stupid ones...~|~translationMissing
I suggest you DON'T talk like that to my crew. They will probably assume you are mocking them and kill you.~|~translationMissing
So let's start again~|~translationMissing
Why yes! Tally-ho!~|~translationMissing
I suppose that will have to do.~|~translationMissing
Here we are at the Pirates' Cove! You'll find the captain already on board.~|~translationMissing
Not just yet...~|~translationMissing
Well hurry it up okay? This place is a dump, and I'm a vicious blood-thirsty pirate, not your personal travel agent.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Lokar.~|~translationMissing
Hi again [Fremennik name]! What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the seal of passage~|~translationMissing
Do I still need the Seal of Passage?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, why?~|~translationMissing
Silly you. You'll have to go back to Brundt the Chieftain to get another before you can go on to Lunar Isle.~|~translationMissing
Can you take me back to Rellekka?~|~translationMissing
Can you take me back to Rellekka please?~|~translationMissing
Hey, if you want to go back to loserville with all the losers, who am I to stop you?~|~translationMissing
Nothing thanks! I just saw you here and thought I'd say hello!~|~translationMissing
Hey, I knew you seemed cool when I met you [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
You won't make many friends on Lunar Isle without your Seal of Passage.~|~translationMissing
That's fine, I'm just going to Pirates' Cove.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'd better go back and get it.~|~translationMissing
Lokar, can you take me back to your ship?~|~translationMissing
Sheesh, make your mind pal, I'm not a taxi service!~|~translationMissing
Go now.~|~translationMissing
Don't go.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I've changed my mind. Again. I don't want to go.~|~translationMissing
You are possibly the most indecisive person I have ever met...~|~translationMissing
Hello. See anything good through your telescope there?~|~translationMissing
'Eagle-eye' Shultz~|~translationMissing
Not really, just those creatures on the island. Don't worry, we sent some men out there to deal with them.~|~translationMissing
The captain said we might have a barbecue out there later...~|~translationMissing
You seem unhappy about that... Wouldn't a barbecue on the beach be fun?~|~translationMissing
You obviously haven't met the cook yet...~|~translationMissing
'Beefy' Burns~|~translationMissing
The galley ain't open fer food yet whipper-snapper, ye'll hafta come back later if'n ye be wanting food.~|~translationMissing
Uh... something something open, something something food?~|~translationMissing
Aye, ter be sure, yer yella-bellied land-lizard!~|~translationMissing
'Birds-Eye' Jack~|~translationMissing
So... What are you doing?~|~translationMissing
Me? I'm the navigator. My job is to ensure the ship travels where it's supposed to go once it's moving by constantly checking our~|~translationMissing
bearings against our plotted course, using charts and a sextant.~|~translationMissing
People often think that we just sail off when we feel like it, but its actually far more complicated than that!~|~translationMissing
Why, when you think of just how much sea there is out there, ANYTHING could happen if there wasn't a competent navigator on board ensuring that we reach our destination safely and in the shortest possible time!~|~translationMissing
Okay. So... What are you doing?~|~translationMissing
As I say, being a navigator is a real skill - you really have to think on your feet!~|~translationMissing
Yesiree, once we get sailing, it's all up to me to make sure we don't run into trouble or go off course!~|~translationMissing
Yep, as the rest of the crew basically stand around not doing much, I'll be the one in the cabin, comparing wind speeds, landmarks and charts with my sextant, making sure that we get to the destination on time, and on~|~translationMissing
course!~|~translationMissing
You could almost say that I'm the linchpin of the entire operation! Why, if it wasn't for me, the rest of the guys might be sailing for, oooh, hours, and be slightly off course and~|~translationMissing
never even known it!~|~translationMissing
They might even be a few hours late for their destination! Or a few miles down the road from it!~|~translationMissing
And then where would they be?~|~translationMissing
A few hours late or a few miles down the road?~|~translationMissing
Exactly!~|~translationMissing
Great. So... What are you doing?~|~translationMissing
Oh, just relaxing while I wait for the ship to cast off.~|~translationMissing
When we're sailing I'll be very busy you know! I'm probably the single most important person on board when we're sailing!~|~translationMissing
Okay, OKAY!~|~translationMissing
Hey, how you doing?~|~translationMissing
First mate 'Davey-boy'~|~translationMissing
It is customary when stowing away on a vessel to not introduce yourself to the Captains First Mate, oh foolish one.~|~translationMissing
Hey! I'm not a stowaway!~|~translationMissing
That Lokar guy invited me aboard...~|~translationMissing
I see. Well, don't distract me as I'm making preparations for departure.~|~translationMissing
Try not to distract any of the crew either, Zamorak knows it's hard enough to get them to do any work around here without strangers wandering round the ship asking them inane questions.~|~translationMissing
Afternoon.~|~translationMissing
Cabin boy~|~translationMissing
Hey, how you doing? You a stowaway?~|~translationMissing
(sigh) NO, I am NOT a stowaway...~|~translationMissing
And to be honest, I don't know why everybody seems to think I am...~|~translationMissing
Hey, I'm not here to judge you, if you're a stowaway you picked a good ship for it!~|~translationMissing
There's lots of convenient hiding places around here - I should know, whenever I'm in trouble with the Captain I find myself a good barrel to hide in, until the fuss dies down.~|~translationMissing
You know, I've always wondered...~|~translationMissing
What exactly is it that a 'cabin boy' actually does on a pirate ship anyway?~|~translationMissing
Mostly make coffee. Occasionally I have to swab the decks, but pirates aren't exactly known for cleanliness, you know?~|~translationMissing
Aye-aye cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Captain Bentley~|~translationMissing
Hmmmm? I don't recognise you as one of my men, what are you doing aboard my ship?~|~translationMissing
Stowaway! Stowaway! *Squark*~|~translationMissing
Oh, Lokar offered me a journey. He said you could take me to the island of the Moon Clan.~|~translationMissing
Oh he DID, did he? (sigh) I sometimes regret ever allowing that vagabond to join the crew.~|~translationMissing
He has a very bad work ethic, and I have to say his attitude can be very confrontational.~|~translationMissing
Lokar's a loser! *Brakawk*!~|~translationMissing
So... You won't take me to Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
Well now, I didn't say that.~|~translationMissing
We are returning there again soon anyway, as our last visit was most profitable.~|~translationMissing
In fact as soon as our boys are finished loading stocks we should be ready to depart!~|~translationMissing
Now, as captain of this ship I feel I must play host, even if you aren't exactly a welcome guest, so was there anything you wished to know?~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me something about the Moon Clan?~|~translationMissing
So... What can you tell me about this 'Moon Clan'? It all seems very mysterious I must say...~|~translationMissing
The Moon Clan? Oh, very fine people. Very hospitable.~|~translationMissing
We had heard that they are very wary of strangers, and dislike people just showing up on their island, but when we sent a landing party aboard they all seemed more than happy to see us.~|~translationMissing
Well, they even threw a big festival in our honour!~|~translationMissing
Anyway, they had a large supply of items that we felt we could use on the high seas, so we made a few trades with them, and were on our way.~|~translationMissing
What kinds of items?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm not sure how much you've heard about them, but they are magical experts.~|~translationMissing
They sold us many rune-stones, as well as a few good luck charms and talismans and such to help us on our voyage.~|~translationMissing
Yes, they might have been a little secretive about that strange temple, and the old lodge of theirs in town, and I must say they certainly have the strangest house I have ever seen in my life in their little village, but it was~|~translationMissing
a pleasant trip all round, and I look forward to trading there again in the future.~|~translationMissing
After all, it's not everywhere that a pirate captain and his crew can rest ashore without having to worry about the authorities catching them, is it?~|~translationMissing
Fight the law! *Squawk*~|~translationMissing
No, I guess it isn't.~|~translationMissing
Was there anything else you wished to ask me about while I'm not busy?~|~translationMissing
What were you doing at Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
What were you doing at Lunar Isle anyway? I always thought pirates would be... You know. Out pirating.~|~translationMissing
Well, obviously the actual pirating is a big part of our agenda, but we like to think of ourselves as non- regulated merchants.~|~translationMissing
What good is plunder if you have nothing to spend it on, hmmmm?~|~translationMissing
Likewise, I am a forward thinking captain, and endeavour to invest much of my plunder back into the ship and its crew, so that we can be a better and more efficient force for theft upon the seas.~|~translationMissing
So you went to Lunar Isle for supplies?~|~translationMissing
Well, obviously not initially. Obviously, our first thought was to show up, rob them blind, then take off again with the plunder spilling from our decks.~|~translationMissing
So what made you change your mind?~|~translationMissing
Well, firstly there were the monsters.~|~translationMissing
M-monsters?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, hundreds of the things. The island's swarming with them you know.~|~translationMissing
Dirty smelly beasts, as big as a wolf! Yes, you'd certainly better be either handy with a blade or quick on your toes if you wanted to spend much time outside of their village with those things around~|~translationMissing
everywhere.~|~translationMissing
*Squawk* Run fer yer lives lads, it's a monster! *Squawk*~|~translationMissing
So you didn't attack the Moon Clan because you were worried you would yourself be attacked by these monsters trying to make your escape?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, absolutely. That and the next reason.~|~translationMissing
The next reason?~|~translationMissing
Yes, the next reason being that the Moon Clan are quite stupendously powerful magicians.~|~translationMissing
You'll notice it as soon as you look at them, really quite, quite powerful indeed.~|~translationMissing
As soon as we saw them we lost any thoughts about trying to attack or steal from them.~|~translationMissing
Which as it turned out was lucky for us.~|~translationMissing
Bunch of blooming loonies! *Brakawk*~|~translationMissing
It was?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. They can read minds, you see. If we'd shown up there thinking about robbing them they would have just killed us all on the spot.~|~translationMissing
I did mention that they are extraordinarily powerful magicians, didn't I?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes you did.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I'm glad I did. Because they really, really are. And mind-readers.~|~translationMissing
Yes, all in all I'm glad we didn't try any funny business in the end after all.~|~translationMissing
Plus there's that other good reason.~|~translationMissing
That reason being?~|~translationMissing
Well, when you are a crew of successful pirates, it becomes more and more difficult to ever moor somewhere and spend your loot.~|~translationMissing
People are far too quick to call the guards on a troublemaker nowadays.~|~translationMissing
So finding a village where people are more than happy to trade with you regardless of who you may have just stolen from and killed.~|~translationMissing
I like that non-judgemental attitude of theirs!~|~translationMissing
Okay then...~|~translationMissing
Anything else you wanted to know before we set sail?~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me something about your ship?~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you could tell me a little bit about your ship. I must say, it's really very impressive.~|~translationMissing
Ah, a connoisseur! Yes, she's named the Lady Zay, and may I say, is one of the finest ships to ever sail the seas!~|~translationMissing
It was a steal from the Karamjan shipyards.~|~translationMissing
And when I say it was a steal, I mean to say that myself and some of the lads broke in and stole it one night.~|~translationMissing
I don't know who they were building these warships for, but whoever it was seemed to be a little on the short side.~|~translationMissing
We had to do a little remodelling of the doors and rooms so that we didn't have to crouch around everywhere, but I've finally got her just how I want her, and we have enough cannons down below decks to~|~translationMissing
bombard a small town I'd wager!~|~translationMissing
*Brawwwwwwk* I want guns, lots of guns! I want guns, lots of guns!~|~translationMissing
I used to own my own ship you know...~|~translationMissing
It was called the Lady Lumbridge if I remember correctly...~|~translationMissing
I wonder whatever happened to it...~|~translationMissing
Interesting. You never struck me as being Captain material, but I guess there's a ship out there for everyone...~|~translationMissing
The Lady Zay is certainly a big step up from my last ship anyway.~|~translationMissing
Your last ship? Why, what was wrong with it?~|~translationMissing
Well, it just wasn't sturdy enough!~|~translationMissing
I was on a perfectly routine raiding expedition to the east of here, when we ran into a squall, that pushed us towards the rocky shore.~|~translationMissing
A few select men and myself managed to escape with our lives intact on a small row boat, but the rest of my crew were washed ashore as the ship was wrecked on those jagged rocks.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, it was a tragedy...~|~translationMissing
To lose such a fine ship in such an insulting manner...~|~translationMissing
And of course the rest of your crew...~|~translationMissing
Who? Oh. Yes. The crew. Yes, it was a tragedy.~|~translationMissing
I'd paid them in advance you know, I'll never see that money again!~|~translationMissing
Um... no, I actually meant it was a shame that so many of your crew must have died in the shipwreck.~|~translationMissing
Was it? Well, if you say so.~|~translationMissing
Actually, the last I had heard quite a few of them had survived, and had set up a little hideaway next to the remains of the shipwreck.~|~translationMissing
If you're particularly worried about them, perhaps you might like to go and pay them a visit someday, and make sure to bring a lot of easily transferable wealth with you.~|~translationMissing
They love people visiting with easily transferable wealth.~|~translationMissing
Now, was there something you wished to talk to me about? Time is pressing on, and we really need to set sail soon if we want to make the most of the winds.~|~translationMissing
*Squawk* Move it or lose it, move it or lose it.~|~translationMissing
Can we sail to Lunar Isle now?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the seal of passage~|~translationMissing
Well, I would be more than happy to take you, unfortunately the Moon Clan are, frankly, very scary people, and I believe they would not take kindly to us bringing a Fremennik there.~|~translationMissing
They are at war with them after all.~|~translationMissing
But I thought Lokar had already been there?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Yes he has. I'm talking about you.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Oh yeah, I'm a Fremennik aren't I?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes you are.~|~translationMissing
I probably should have kept that Seal Of Passage Brundt the Chieftain gave me with me, shouldn't I?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes you should have. Honestly, you're going to need it with you.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I can't let you travel with us without it.~|~translationMissing
*Brakawk* Don't drop quest items half way through a quest! *Squawk*~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll go and get it again then.~|~translationMissing
You do that.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the seal of passage~|~translationMissing
Can we sail to Lunar Isle now? I must say, it all sounds very intriguing over there...~|~translationMissing
As long as you keep your Seal Of Passage with you at all times while you are on the island you should be okay, even if you are a Fremennik.~|~translationMissing
I'm not kidding, they are a very dangerous people, and it would NOT be wise for you to travel there without your Seal Of Passage marking you as a diplomat.~|~translationMissing
Okay, keep my Seal with me at all times, check. Can we go now?~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes indeed! The winds seem good, so let's make a move!~|~translationMissing
She's blowing a storm, cap'n! *Brarrrrrk*~|~translationMissing
Cutscene of boat circling island on map plays.~|~translationMissing
Well... THAT was deuced strange!~|~translationMissing
Um... Way to sail a boat?~|~translationMissing
*Squawk* Way to sail a boat! Way to sail a boat! *Brarrrk*~|~translationMissing
This... This is VERY strange!~|~translationMissing
Absolutely nothing at all.~|~translationMissing
No, actually, I don't really want to know anything that you can tell me.~|~translationMissing
In fact, I don't even know why I began talking to you in the first place!~|~translationMissing
Hmmmm. You could perhaps be more grateful to someone offering you free transport, but then I suppose you are a friend of Lokar's, and a Fremennik, so I suppose the~|~translationMissing
rudeness is natural.~|~translationMissing
Make sure you are ready for departure, I will be issuing orders to set sail shortly.~|~translationMissing
Jenny Blade~|~translationMissing
In all my years as a pirate, I have never seen such sailing!~|~translationMissing
What do you think caused it?~|~translationMissing
If I was a less superstitious person, I would suggest an evil magic of some kind.~|~translationMissing
Iiiinteresting...~|~translationMissing
Pretty crazy sailing you guys got here!~|~translationMissing
Murky Pat~|~translationMissing
Weird, the ships never done that before...~|~translationMissing
Do you know what's wrong with the ship? I've never seen a ship sail in a big circle like that before...~|~translationMissing
'Sticky' Sanders~|~translationMissing
I can't say for sure, but it must be either the Captain or the Navigator to blame.~|~translationMissing
They're the only ones who control the actual sailing of the ship.~|~translationMissing
I see... Thank you, that's very helpful.~|~translationMissing
Wow. Pretty rubbish sailing just then, huh?~|~translationMissing
I have literally never seen anything like it! The ship seemed to... I don't know, suddenly swing round as we approached shore!~|~translationMissing
then somehow we were right back where we started! This is all very peculiar if you ask me, I have never seen anything like it in all of my years on the high seas.~|~translationMissing
What do you think might be happening?~|~translationMissing
Well, my first thought would be that we have jinx aboard.~|~translationMissing
A jinx?~|~translationMissing
Yes, a jinx. Someone who has recently come aboard and seems to be bringing us bad luck. If it is a jinx, the only answer would be to throw them~|~translationMissing
overboard as shark food.~|~translationMissing
You just recently came aboard the ship yourself didn't you? Because I don't recall us having any trouble before you showed up.~|~translationMissing
Uh... yes... But... I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything. I hope.~|~translationMissing
Well, you had better hope it isn't your fault. If there's one thing I hate more than a stowaway, it's a jinx.~|~translationMissing
'Picarron' Pete~|~translationMissing
Woah! Did you see that crazy trip?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, what do you think happened?~|~translationMissing
I dunno, but I'm keeping out of it. I don't want anyone blaming me for it!~|~translationMissing
Tommy 2-times~|~translationMissing
How... bizarre.~|~translationMissing
What is?~|~translationMissing
You didn't see what the ship just did?~|~translationMissing
Yes... But I'm not a sailor. Is that abnormal then?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes it is. VERY abnormal.~|~translationMissing
What do you want, spoken to the captain yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but I will.~|~translationMissing
Well do it.~|~translationMissing
I am, watch, here I go.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm sooooo scared now.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, you better be.~|~translationMissing
But you're still here.~|~translationMissing
Yeah but not for long.~|~translationMissing
Well you better go then.~|~translationMissing
Fine, I'm gone.~|~translationMissing
Who's driving this thing anyway?~|~translationMissing
'Beedy-eye' Jones~|~translationMissing
It's called sailing, but I don't know what's happening.~|~translationMissing
Is someone gonna fix it then?~|~translationMissing
I hope so. I wanted to pick up some new clothes on Lunar Isle next time we went back.~|~translationMissing
'Betty' B.Boppin~|~translationMissing
What's happening with the ship???~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you could tell me...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, no.~|~translationMissing
Pretty crazy sailing we did just then, huh?~|~translationMissing
Did we? Ah, sorry ter say but I missed the whole thing, I've bin a mite busy down here in the ole galley.~|~translationMissing
We seemed to be getting somewhere, but we're right back where we started!~|~translationMissing
Aye, I've felt like that me whole life ter be honest...~|~translationMissing
...Okay. I'll just leave you to... Whatever it is that you do.~|~translationMissing
Aye, that'll be fer the best whipper-snapper, if'n ye be wanting any food cooked at all.~|~translationMissing
What happened to the ship?~|~translationMissing
'Lecherous' Lee~|~translationMissing
I have no idea! It doesn't normally do that!~|~translationMissing
Weird.~|~translationMissing
So the Captain's a very bad sailor I take it?~|~translationMissing
No... Usually he's one of the best around, I don't know why we didn't reach our destination like we were supposed to, and it CERTAINLY wasn't anything to do with me~|~translationMissing
or anything I have done!~|~translationMissing
Alright, calm down I wasn't accusing you of anything!~|~translationMissing
Good, because it has NOTHING to do with me!~|~translationMissing
IT'S NOT MY FAULT!~|~translationMissing
I think you should lay off the coffee for a bit, youngster...~|~translationMissing
So you reckon it's the navigator or the Captain's fault?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, stands to reason, dunnit?~|~translationMissing
Was the ship supposed to go in a big loop like that?~|~translationMissing
Jack Sails~|~translationMissing
Pretty sure it wasn't, no...~|~translationMissing
Any idea what caused it?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely none at all...~|~translationMissing
Did you just see that?~|~translationMissing
The ship sailing. Or not sailing. Or sailing in a big circle and coming back here.~|~translationMissing
I don't know, I'm not a sailor! But whatever it was, it was very odd!~|~translationMissing
Can't say that I did, no. Sorry, I was keeping an eye out.~|~translationMissing
An eye out? For what?~|~translationMissing
Um... Sorry, I can't really say, but I'll know it when I see it!~|~translationMissing
Bedread the bold~|~translationMissing
Sorry, don't have time to chat! Something's up with the ship, I'm trying to find out what!~|~translationMissing
I... I don't understand... This is all very strange...~|~translationMissing
That was possibly the most pointless journey I have ever taken in my life.~|~translationMissing
The course was plotted, we had a fair tailwind the whole journey...~|~translationMissing
BUT WE HAVEN'T BUDGED AN INCH!~|~translationMissing
I just don't understand it... Maybe you should speak with Jack.~|~translationMissing
Our navigator. He's at the rear of the ship, one floor below deck. He's an old sea-dog with a brown pirate's hat.~|~translationMissing
Below deck, below deck!~|~translationMissing
Can we try again?~|~translationMissing
Yes, you're right, perhaps it was just a freak wind. Off we go!~|~translationMissing
Hey, are you the navigator?~|~translationMissing
That I am. Why?~|~translationMissing
Think you can navigate us a course on this ship that isn't a BIG STUPID CIRCLE?~|~translationMissing
I'm SURE I don't know what you mean!~|~translationMissing
C'mon now... If you're the navigator, then it stands to reason it's your fault we didn't sail anywhere!~|~translationMissing
Now listen here bucko, my course was true, like all of my others, and if you have a problem with how I do my job, then you'd better go and speak to the Captain about it, because I don't appreciate a stowaway~|~translationMissing
wandering in here and criticising me!~|~translationMissing
Well maybe I will go and talk to the Captain about you.~|~translationMissing
You'd better do that then.~|~translationMissing
Hey there captain.~|~translationMissing
What are you wanting now?~|~translationMissing
Cutscene repeats of the boat sailing in a circle.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps it's the Navigator's fault?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps the navigator made a mistake when he plotted the course?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, you think so? Perhaps I'd better ask him about that...~|~translationMissing
But... His course looked true.. I just don't understand...~|~translationMissing
I'll go ask him what happened for you, Captain.~|~translationMissing
You will? Well, thank you!~|~translationMissing
You're very helpful for a stowaway! He's one floor below deck. To the rear of the ship.~|~translationMissing
I'M NOT A STOWAWAY! GAH!~|~translationMissing
So what did the navigator have to say for himself?~|~translationMissing
Does he have any explanation for why we keep sailing in a big circle every time we try to get to Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
I, uh, kind of didn't bother to go and talk to him yet...~|~translationMissing
*Squaaaawk* Lazy stowaway!~|~translationMissing
Maybe we were just unlucky that last time?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you want me to try and set sail again?~|~translationMissing
It can't hurt, right?~|~translationMissing
I suppose so. Off we go!~|~translationMissing
This crazy sailing... Think it could be the navigator's fault?~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess it could be... Seems a little strange for him to do that though.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I guess.~|~translationMissing
The captain seems to think that the navigator is repsonsible for the problems with the ship...~|~translationMissing
He's an arrogant fool, but he gets the job done.~|~translationMissing
I'd have to say the Captains wrong about that.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Okay, thanks.~|~translationMissing
That sailing was horrible. I blame the navigator.~|~translationMissing
You know, speaking ill of someone behind their back isn't cool.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, you're right, sorry.~|~translationMissing
So... The rumour is that it's all the navigator's fault that the ship keeps going around in a big circle.~|~translationMissing
Is it now? That sounds like exactly the kind of thing that a stowaway and a jinx might say to throw suspicion off of himself.~|~translationMissing
You think this is my fault?~|~translationMissing
Ah, so you finally admit you are a stowaway and a jinx!~|~translationMissing
What? NO! Look, I'm pretty sure it's nothing to do with me...~|~translationMissing
Well, for your sake I hope you're right. Killing people is such a chore.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and speak to the navigator immediately.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. So... That navigator.~|~translationMissing
Rumours say that it's his fault the ships going round in circles now.~|~translationMissing
Really? Seems strange to me, I made a point of watching our course last time we sailed, and we didn't deviate at all, but somehow ended up back here.~|~translationMissing
Well, the Captain thinks it must be his fault!~|~translationMissing
No... I'm not so sure about that...~|~translationMissing
Well, I spoke to both the Captain and the Navigator, and it seems to me it must be the navigator's fault that we're sailing in circles.~|~translationMissing
Seems a logical conclusion to me too.~|~translationMissing
Glad you think so!~|~translationMissing
I heard a rumour that the ship isn't going anywhere because of the navigator...~|~translationMissing
I don't deal with gossips.~|~translationMissing
So what do you think? We keep going round in circles because the navigator is useless?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, the navigator, absolutely, sounds about right, yup.~|~translationMissing
Nope, it has certainly nothing to do with me or anything that I have done to the ship, I swear on my dead mothers life!~|~translationMissing
Um... okay then.~|~translationMissing
I bet it's the navigator's fault.~|~translationMissing
The weirdness with the ship.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Could be I suppose.~|~translationMissing
I blame the navigator for the ships weirdness.~|~translationMissing
His fault, eh? Well, I never liked him much anyway.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, me neither.~|~translationMissing
Hey, think the problems with the ship is the navigator's fault?~|~translationMissing
Yup, could be. Could well be.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. What can you tell me about the navigator of this ship?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I've never spoken to the man.~|~translationMissing
How can you never have spoken to him? There's only like 10 people aboard the entire ship!~|~translationMissing
Dunno. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Do you know of any reason why the navigator would be deliberately sabotaging our journey?~|~translationMissing
No, and I can't believe he would.~|~translationMissing
So. Absolutely rubbish sailing. It's the navigator's fault, right? You're with me on that, yeah?~|~translationMissing
Aye, if'n yer say it's true then it must be!~|~translationMissing
...and Rhysdog3 is the greatest pirate who ever lived?~|~translationMissing
Rhysdog3 yer say? Aye, well I guess that they must be if'n that's what ye're telling me there.~|~translationMissing
You know what? I like you.~|~translationMissing
Although admittedly I haven't tried any of your food...~|~translationMissing
So... Call yourself a navigator huh? Way to plot a course that's a big circle!~|~translationMissing
Frankly sirrah your rudeness is quite appalling!~|~translationMissing
My calculations and plotted course were expertly calculated, and there can be only one reason why the ship has failed to arrive at its expected destination.~|~translationMissing
Oh really? What's that then? Wrong kind of waves? Your steering wheel got stuck?~|~translationMissing
I do not have to take this kind of abuse from a common stowaway!~|~translationMissing
I'll have you know that I am a personal friend of the Captain, and he himself invited me aboard for a small cruise around Lunar Isle along with a variety of local delicacies and beverages!~|~translationMissing
Really? You don't seem like the type he would make friends with.~|~translationMissing
Oh, absolutely. Me and him go way back. Waaaaaaay back.~|~translationMissing
We're like... apples and custard. Everybody says so.~|~translationMissing
Yup, me and Captain Renney, we're a team.~|~translationMissing
You mean Captain Bentley?~|~translationMissing
Right. Bentley. That's what I said.~|~translationMissing
No you didn't. You called him Captain Renney.~|~translationMissing
Oh, yeah, it's like a nickname. Only his friends are allowed to call him that.~|~translationMissing
Yet I have known him for over 20 years and he has never asked to be referred to as anything except Captain Bentley.~|~translationMissing
Wow, he must hate you.~|~translationMissing
And indeed, he has never mentioned any stowaway looking vagabonds as friends.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's all besides the point. It's all your fault and I'm going to make sure the Captain fizzles your gizzard, or whatever it is you piratey types do to each other.~|~translationMissing
But it wasn't my fault!~|~translationMissing
Look, see for yourself! All co-ordinates for the journey are carefully plotted to all visible waypoints and landmasses!~|~translationMissing
There can only be one POSSIBLE explanation why the ship hasn't reached its destination, as I mentioned before!~|~translationMissing
Oh really? And what would that be then?~|~translationMissing
And your explanation had better be good, or Captain Renney is going to shiver your timbers for good!~|~translationMissing
Right. Whatever. Carry on.~|~translationMissing
Magic. It must be magic. Somebody must have jinxed our ship, but I have no idea who would have done that or why.~|~translationMissing
Although your highly suspicious behaviour towards me, and mysterious sudden appearance on board at the *exact time* that this jinx appears to have been brought upon us would seem to make you the obvious candidate.~|~translationMissing
And we all know what we do to someone who is a jinx.~|~translationMissing
Uh... We do?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm sure your good friend Captain Bentley has told you all about the last jinx we had on board.~|~translationMissing
Oh, absolutely he did, yes. I just uh, have these lapses in memory occasionally.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it was horrible. I never knew the human body could contain so many mackerel.~|~translationMissing
And then that thing they did with the tinderbox and the cheese... I still wake up with nightmares about that sometimes...~|~translationMissing
Er... Right. I'd better go find that jinx then before someone else accuses me of this being my fault.~|~translationMissing
SO! I've found you, YOU JINX!~|~translationMissing
What? I'm not a jinx, we've already had this discussion!~|~translationMissing
Sorry. I thought you might be, and that I could trick it out of you by shouting it at you as an accusation.~|~translationMissing
That approach works, does it?~|~translationMissing
Well, not yet, no. But there's always a first time for everything.~|~translationMissing
I think a more subtle approach might yield you better results.~|~translationMissing
(sigh) I suppose so... It just won't be as much fun...~|~translationMissing
You don't know anything about a jinx onboard do you?~|~translationMissing
I heard a rumour there's a jinx aboard...~|~translationMissing
Really? I hope not, they're evil things.~|~translationMissing
Hi. Know anything about jinxes?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely nothing. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about it.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I'm looking for a jinx...~|~translationMissing
Why would you be after one of those evil things?~|~translationMissing
Well, I think there might be one onboard.~|~translationMissing
Gosh, I hope not!~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about jinxes?~|~translationMissing
Only that they're extremely bad things to have aboard a ship.~|~translationMissing
Yup, I'd already figured that much out.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I have reason to believe that someone or something has somehow placed a jinx upon this ship, preventing it from sailing as it is supposed to.~|~translationMissing
Know anything about that?~|~translationMissing
A jinx yer say? Wassat, some kinda fancy foreign vegetable?~|~translationMissing
Um... No, no I don't think this ship has been cursed by a fancy foreign vegetable...~|~translationMissing
All vegetables are evil if you ask me!~|~translationMissing
I don't think I did ask you...~|~translationMissing
That's right then, we'll hear no more about evil foreign vegetables.~|~translationMissing
Or evil domestic vegetables.~|~translationMissing
Or vegetables at all! Death ter vegetables!~|~translationMissing
Okay then... 'bye.~|~translationMissing
Hey hey hey! Apparently there's a jinx on board. Or the navigator is rubbish.~|~translationMissing
One of the two, I'm not sure which.~|~translationMissing
Yes, and I believe I'm looking right at him. Would this jinx also be a stowaway?~|~translationMissing
Look, this calling me a stowaway and a jinx isn't funny!~|~translationMissing
I quite agree. Perhaps you should leave?~|~translationMissing
I'm going to find who or what this jinx is, if only so I can prove to you that it's not me!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Well, you had best do that then, and stop disturbing me.~|~translationMissing
You had better get some evidence quickly as well, I would so hate to have to kill you. Killing someone really tends to ruin my day.~|~translationMissing
I have it on good authority that there's a jinx on board the ship stopping it sailing anywhere.~|~translationMissing
A jinx, you say? My my my, it's been a long time since I've heard of one of those...~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about it.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, but I hope you find it. They're evil things, especially on a boat.~|~translationMissing
Hello there... Mr. Boy?~|~translationMissing
Just call me 'boy'. Everybody else does.~|~translationMissing
Don't you have a real name?~|~translationMissing
Not that I can remember, no.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Right then.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I believe that there may be a jinx aboard this ship, and that is what is preventing us from sailing to Lunar Isle.~|~translationMissing
A jinx? I don't know ANYTHING about that!~|~translationMissing
IT'S NOT MY FAULT OKAY?~|~translationMissing
I don't think I was actually accusing you of anything there...um, boy.~|~translationMissing
You weren't? Oh. IT WAS STILL NOTHING TO DO WITH ME!~|~translationMissing
You're very defensive, aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Sorry. It's my job, you know?~|~translationMissing
I'm always getting the blame for things that go wrong aboard.~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess you don't know anything useful.~|~translationMissing
The captain thinks there might be a jinx aboard. Any help?~|~translationMissing
Well, that makes sense, but sorry I don't know anything about that.~|~translationMissing
I have reason to believe that there is a jinx aboard this ship.~|~translationMissing
IT MIGHT EVEN BE YOU!~|~translationMissing
Do I look like a jinx to you?~|~translationMissing
Erm... I don't know. I don't know what a jinx looks like.~|~translationMissing
It might be an idea for you to find out before accusing people.~|~translationMissing
Now, I'm not much of a seafaring guy, but as I understand it this ship has somehow gotten a jinx, which is messing up the sailing to Lunar Isle!~|~translationMissing
Really? Oh, that's terrible news.~|~translationMissing
I hope someone's doing something about it.~|~translationMissing
Er, yeah, I am.~|~translationMissing
Seems like the problems with the ship are all down to a jinx.~|~translationMissing
Aw no... I hate those things...~|~translationMissing
Oh captain, my captain.~|~translationMissing
So you've spoken to my navigator again, yes? What does he have to say for himself?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. He tried to hide his incompetence by blaming the ships' problems on a jinx of some sort.~|~translationMissing
A JINX you say???~|~translationMissing
Aye, I have to admit that does sound like a logical explanation...~|~translationMissing
No, I'm still pretty sure it's just the navigator being really rubbish at his job...~|~translationMissing
No, no, a jinx, that makes all too much sense I'm afraid...~|~translationMissing
Well, the solution is obvious.~|~translationMissing
We need to find who or what has been jinxed and remove it from the ship immediately.~|~translationMissing
Right. And when you say 'we' need to find you actually mean...?~|~translationMissing
*brakawk* He means you dummy! You dummy! *Squawk*~|~translationMissing
Well, as Captain I have certain responsibilities that must be fulfilled, so I would greatly appreciate a little assistance in tracking down this jinx...~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I was afraid you were going to say that...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll try and track down this jinx for you.~|~translationMissing
Good lad! Let me know if you find out anything important.~|~translationMissing
(sigh) Yes, Captain.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. So, I'm wondering if you know anything about a jinx at all?~|~translationMissing
A jinx you say? Argh, those are evil things!~|~translationMissing
Quick question~|~translationMissing
What exactly is a jinx anyway?~|~translationMissing
Ah, well they take many forms.~|~translationMissing
Sometimes it will just be a person with such staggeringly bad luck that everything they do or say invariably leads them into trouble and commotion, through no fault of their own.~|~translationMissing
Everything they touch will always bring them misery, and everything they think they have achieved will always end in disaster.~|~translationMissing
But then there is the other kind of jinx, the even worse kind.~|~translationMissing
It is a curse put upon someone, often attached to an object of some kind, and it is done deliberately, so that misfortune will always follow the owner of that object.~|~translationMissing
So why is it such a big deal to sailors?~|~translationMissing
Ah, well now. When you're on land, bad luck can be an annoyance, and possibly even bring you grief, but it is rarely deadly.~|~translationMissing
A jinx on land may fall over tree roots, or lose their coins down a drain, or some other irritation.~|~translationMissing
But at sea! With nothing saving you from the cold murky death of drowning except the wood below your feet?~|~translationMissing
Why, jinxes can kill not just you, but the entire crew of a ship! They are an evil thing indeed, and the only thing you can do to save yourself and your crew is to forcibly~|~translationMissing
remove the jinx from the ship as soon as possible. Dead or alive.~|~translationMissing
Or casting some kind of anti-curse magic upon the jinxed item might work, but to be honest, throwing them overboard is quicker.~|~translationMissing
Wait, so someone with magical powers can deliberately place a jinx upon someone or something?~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes. But they would have to be a very magical and very evil person to risk the lives of an entire ship over some trivial matter.~|~translationMissing
Someone highly magical like, oh, let's say for the sake of argument, the inhabitants of Lunar Isle, a.k.a the Moon Clan?~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose so... But for them to curse our entire boat?~|~translationMissing
Somebody from the landing party must have done something highly offensive to them at the feast for them to place such an evil enchantment that risks the lives of the entire crew.~|~translationMissing
So somebody from the landing party must have gotten themselves jinxed...~|~translationMissing
Thanks a lot 'Eagle-eye', you've been extremely helpful.~|~translationMissing
So... Any ideas who might have offended the Moon Clan and caused them to place a jinx on the ship?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm afraid I have no idea. I guess it must have happened when we were all on shore leave, but I honestly don't remember much about it...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. No ideas at all?~|~translationMissing
Anyone from the crew you think would be particularly offensive to a bunch of highly powerful magic users?~|~translationMissing
Well, we're something of a mixed bag around here as I'm sure you've noticed, but...~|~translationMissing
Sorry. Nobody springs to mind.~|~translationMissing
Hiya.~|~translationMissing
Hi. I don't suppose you have any juicy gossip about that trip to Lunar Isle do you?~|~translationMissing
Gossip? Like what?~|~translationMissing
I heard a really funny story about the First Mate, the captain's parrot and a coconut!~|~translationMissing
No... I was thinking more something about someone behaving very badly and offending the Moon Clan somehow...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I wouldn't know anything about that.~|~translationMissing
Hi, how can I help you?~|~translationMissing
I was wondering...~|~translationMissing
I feel kind of awkward asking...~|~translationMissing
Ah, just come out and say it. I'm a pirate, it's not like I get offended easily.~|~translationMissing
Actually it's about offending people. You didn't, you know, tick off any of the Moon Clan while you were there recently did you?~|~translationMissing
Gosh, I hope not. They might have been very hospitable towards us, but there was definitely something spooky about them!~|~translationMissing
And I suppose you didn't see anyone acting untoward around them?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, can't say as I did...~|~translationMissing
Okay, well thanks anyway.~|~translationMissing
Hey, no problem.~|~translationMissing
Hi. Erm, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but are you particularly offensive?~|~translationMissing
Does your mere presence at any occasion cause young children to start crying, old ladies to faint, that kind of thing?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure I like your tone of voice!~|~translationMissing
Look, all I want to know is if your terrible disregard for social niceties has caused a jinx to be levelled upon this ship and all who sail in her.~|~translationMissing
ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks! All I wanted to know!~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for somebody who may have offended the Moon Clan on your recent visit to Lunar Isle...~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I know nothing about that.~|~translationMissing
Oh. I was hoping you did.~|~translationMissing
(ahem)~|~translationMissing
I have heard some terrible, scurrilous rumours about your wanton and depraved behaviour towards the Moon Clan when on shore leave.~|~translationMissing
What? What ARE you talking about?~|~translationMissing
Oh come now, we all know what you were up to...~|~translationMissing
Your behaviour was so bad that the Moon Clan have brought a terrible curse down upon the ship, trapping it on this gods-forsaken island forever!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Well, I'm sure the crew have more sense than to listen to the insane babble of a stowaway, especially not one whose rantings are designed to cover his own jinxed~|~translationMissing
life.~|~translationMissing
So you deny it then?~|~translationMissing
Deny what? You come in here, spouting some random bilge at me, with a flurry of accusations, and expect anyone to take you seriously?~|~translationMissing
Oh.. erm... Well done. You've passed the test.~|~translationMissing
Test?~|~translationMissing
Yeah... the, uh, loyalty test. The Captain wanted to make sure his crew were all well behaved on their shore leave, so I came up with this little test to make sure you were.~|~translationMissing
And congratulations! You passed!~|~translationMissing
A stowaway, a jinx, AND a liar.~|~translationMissing
I must say I am extremely glad you are only here temporarily, I would hate for any of my crew to have any sort of dealing with you.~|~translationMissing
Please make sure you close the door on your way out.~|~translationMissing
Erm, 'bye then.~|~translationMissing
Hi. Now... about this jinx...~|~translationMissing
I have reason to believe that it may have been caused by somebody who has offended the Moon Clan somehow while on that recent visit of yours to Lunar Isle.~|~translationMissing
Yup. I'm afraid so.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound like anyone on board...~|~translationMissing
We may be pirates, but we're all surprisingly well- mannered!~|~translationMissing
So you don't know anything about it?~|~translationMissing
Well, thanks anyway.~|~translationMissing
Hey. What's up?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's like this~|~translationMissing
Apparently one of the crew was up to something on Lunar Isle that caused the Moon Clan to be offended, which has led to this jinx being placed on someone or~|~translationMissing
something aboard the ship.~|~translationMissing
That's the closest I can figure it anyway, I have to admit this is all very confusing...~|~translationMissing
I SWEAR I DIDN'T MEAN TO!~|~translationMissing
...What?~|~translationMissing
...Nothing. I didn't do anything. At all.~|~translationMissing
And nobody can prove that I did, even if I had, which I didn't so they can't. So there.~|~translationMissing
Wait, are you telling me you might have had something to do with this?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm telling you the EXACT OPPOSITE!~|~translationMissing
It wasn't me! I SWEAR!~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? Because a minute ago it really sounded to me as though you-~|~translationMissing
NO! NOT ME! NUH-UH! NO WAY!~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, I believe you, I believe you. There's no need to shout at me.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I just didn't want you getting the wrong impression and telling the Captain anything, is all.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, I can understand that. Well, see you around.~|~translationMissing
IT WASN'T -~|~translationMissing
Oh, I mean, goodbye stowaway.~|~translationMissing
AH-HA! I KNOW it was YOU!~|~translationMissing
Oh, what is it now?~|~translationMissing
Well, it seems that someone must have offended the Moon Clan, so that they put a jinx on the ship!~|~translationMissing
And from what I've seen you're the obvious culprit!~|~translationMissing
No, I don't think so.~|~translationMissing
This seems once again an effort on your behalf to throw the trail away from your own jinxed self bringing us misfortune.~|~translationMissing
So... You didn't offend any Moon Clan while you were on their island?~|~translationMissing
Are you REALLY sure?~|~translationMissing
I am the very model of self-restraint. As you should have realised by now, as I haven't yet given the order to have you put to death. Yet.~|~translationMissing
Hum. Are you sure?~|~translationMissing
REALLY sure?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I suggest you check elsewhere.~|~translationMissing
Fine. But I've got my eye on you Mr Navigator!~|~translationMissing
Yes, and I certainly have my eye on you.~|~translationMissing
You know that visit to Lunar Isle you lot have just made...?~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah! It was great! They're kind of spooky, but hey, it was a great do they laid on for us!~|~translationMissing
You didn't see anyone, you know, acting inappropriately or anything did you?~|~translationMissing
Um... Anyone doing anything that would offend them?~|~translationMissing
Nope, can't say as I did...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Okay then.~|~translationMissing
On Lunar Isle...~|~translationMissing
You didn't... You know. Do anything offensive towards the Moon Clan did you?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Okay, it was worth asking anyway.~|~translationMissing
Seeya.~|~translationMissing
I've heard you were a little bit merry on the old Lunar Isle expedition...~|~translationMissing
Possibly so merry that you did something to offend the Moon Clan and unleash a horrible curse upon us all...~|~translationMissing
Heavens, no! Just because I'm a pirate doesn't mean I don't treat all cultures no matter how different with the utmost respect!~|~translationMissing
So it wasn't you?~|~translationMissing
Nope. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Do you know anyone who offended the Moon Clan on your recent visit?~|~translationMissing
Quick answer~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks!~|~translationMissing
Dude! Duuuuuuude! Dude!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, do I know you?~|~translationMissing
Dude! How about them Moon Clan, huh?~|~translationMissing
Wow, we offended them so hard on that shore leave, huh?~|~translationMissing
You, uh, didn't do anything to offend the Moon Clan on shore leave, did you?~|~translationMissing
And I look like an idiot now, don't I?~|~translationMissing
You do, yes. Very much so.~|~translationMissing
It would probably be best if I just left now, instead of carrying on talking, wouldn't it?~|~translationMissing
It would, yes.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and do that then...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, the galley's closed fer restockings! Yer'll hafta come back later if'n ye be wanting food!~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm not after food, I'm after information...~|~translationMissing
Wussat? Some kind of alkyhol? If'n it ain't grog, I don't be stocking it!~|~translationMissing
...Can I just ask you a few questions?~|~translationMissing
Aye, that yer may, long'n as yer don't mind me carrying on with me restockings while we talk.~|~translationMissing
No, that's fine. I appreciate your time.~|~translationMissing
So... I have reason to believe that a jinx has befallen the ship due to someone offending the Moon Clan somehow... I was wondering if you knew anything about that.~|~translationMissing
The Moon Clan yer say? Ah, well I dinna know much about them folks, when everyone else went to that there big old feast I stayed aboard the ship...~|~translationMissing
I gots ter be honest, I never trust any food I ain't prepared meself!~|~translationMissing
Wait... So the whole crew except yourself were at a big feast on Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
Was there drink involved at this feast?~|~translationMissing
Aye, ter be sure!~|~translationMissing
So a bunch of drunken pirates feasting on Lunar Isle.~|~translationMissing
I think I have my suspect for when the Moon Clan were offended.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the help there, Beefy!~|~translationMissing
Hey there Beefy!~|~translationMissing
Ah, it be you agin, what can i do yer for?~|~translationMissing
About this big feast that all the pirates went to on Lunar Isle...~|~translationMissing
All the pirates cept'n me yer mean?~|~translationMissing
Yes, this big feast that everybody went to except for you.~|~translationMissing
What did yer want ter know abaht it?~|~translationMissing
Oh, just what information you could tell me about it. Who was there, what food was served, what entertainment was laid on if any, where it was held.~|~translationMissing
You know, the little details. I'm hoping I can catch someone out in a lie.~|~translationMissing
Yer wants me ter be telling yers all about a feast I wasnae even at?~|~translationMissing
Er... yes. If you could.~|~translationMissing
I thinks yer need to be laying off of the old alkyhol, mate.~|~translationMissing
Hey you know that big feast they held for us on Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
Us? What 'us'?~|~translationMissing
Erm, you. And the rest of the crew.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I remember it well. It was a surprisingly restrained evening on all of our parts.~|~translationMissing
So no crazy offensive behaviours from anyone.~|~translationMissing
No, not at all. Everybody was surprisingly well behaved.~|~translationMissing
I see... And the whole crew was there the whole time?~|~translationMissing
You didn't see anyone sneaking off mid-feast or anything?~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, I don't believe I did.~|~translationMissing
That big feast on Lunar Isle... You were there right? The whole evening?~|~translationMissing
Didn't see anyone being rude to the Moon Clan? Weren't being rude yourself?~|~translationMissing
Didn't see anyone sneak away in the middle of the feast or anything?~|~translationMissing
Okay then, that's all I wanted to know.~|~translationMissing
Hey there.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the big feast you went to on Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
Oh man, that feast totally RAWKED!~|~translationMissing
So you got a little bit merry at it?~|~translationMissing
Oh man, like you WOULDN'T BELIEVE!~|~translationMissing
You didn't get... TOO overboard with your fun did you?~|~translationMissing
No way man, I know when enough's enough.~|~translationMissing
You didn't see anyone else going... a little bit too far with their fun either?~|~translationMissing
No, I have to say everybody was surprisingly well behaved considering it was our first shore leave in quite a few months!~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
You again? You still looking for the jinx then?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I just have a few quick questions for you...~|~translationMissing
Ask away. I have nothing to hide.~|~translationMissing
Well, I just wanted to ask you about that big feast on Lunar Isle you went to...~|~translationMissing
Ask away.~|~translationMissing
Did you see anyone slip away during it? Or see anyone acting extremely badly? Or maybe you saw someone being rude to the Moon Clan somehow?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I didn't see much beyond the food on my plate and the grog in my tankard.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll have to continue checking around.~|~translationMissing
Well, good luck with that. I'm very uneasy knowing that there's a jinx on board.~|~translationMissing
Very well thanks, I just have a few questions I'd like to ask you about that big feast at Lunar Isle...~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, those were the days!~|~translationMissing
Good, was it?~|~translationMissing
Oh, like you wouldn't believe... The food... The wine... The women... The songs...~|~translationMissing
It was everything any honest pirate could ever hope for!~|~translationMissing
And you were all there?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... I think so...~|~translationMissing
Except the Captain obviously.~|~translationMissing
And you didn't see anyone behaving particularly badly? Or being rude to any of the Moon Clan or anything?~|~translationMissing
Can't say as I did.~|~translationMissing
I have some questions for you about that big feast you all went to on Lunar Isle.~|~translationMissing
Oh no, not you again!~|~translationMissing
AH-HA! IS that an admission of guilt?~|~translationMissing
How is that an admission of guilt???~|~translationMissing
Well, you didn't deny anything.~|~translationMissing
What's to deny??? You haven't asked me anything!~|~translationMissing
A minor technicality.~|~translationMissing
(sigh) Please... Please just ask me your questions then leave me alone...~|~translationMissing
Well okay then. So tell me Mr Navigator, where were you exactly at this feast on Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
Er... at the feast?~|~translationMissing
Oh, really?~|~translationMissing
Yeees....~|~translationMissing
So you claim to have been at this feast the whole time that you were at this feast?~|~translationMissing
Um... yes, how could I not have been at the feast the whole time that I was at the feast?~|~translationMissing
I'm asking the questions here!~|~translationMissing
So you were at the feast. So you say.~|~translationMissing
But I put it to you Mr Navigator that once you had arrived at the feast, when it grew quieter and nobody noticed, you left and decided to steal something from the Moon Clan, and be very rude to some other~|~translationMissing
members of the Moon Clan on the way.~|~translationMissing
And then you... I don't know. Killed their puppies or something.~|~translationMissing
Then after you had done all that, you returned to the feast, before anyone noticed that you had left, and then made sure your alibi was complete, and that nobody would discover your rude, thieving, puppy murdering~|~translationMissing
ways.~|~translationMissing
Look, I've had just about enough of you!~|~translationMissing
AH-HA! I notice you don't deny it!~|~translationMissing
' I'm not even going to dignify that with a response, you have come in here with a string of falsehoods against me, and apparently have some vendetta against me for some reason unknown to me, when I think it's pretty~|~translationMissing
clear that if anybody is a jinx on this ship it is you!~|~translationMissing
AM NOT!~|~translationMissing
ARE TOO!~|~translationMissing
Look, this is getting us nowhere, I promise you if you confess I will make the Captain go easy on you!~|~translationMissing
Confess to WHAT exactly??? I have done nothing wrong!~|~translationMissing
I went to a feast on Lunar Isle, I stayed with the rest of the crew the whole night, I didn't see anyone offending them, and I didn't do anything to offend them myself!~|~translationMissing
Thanks, that's all I wanted to know. See you around.~|~translationMissing
Ahoy there! I have a few questions for you.~|~translationMissing
Hmmmm?~|~translationMissing
It's about that feast that you all went to on Lunar Isle...~|~translationMissing
What of it?~|~translationMissing
You had a good time at it, right?~|~translationMissing
Well of course. Even the first officer has to have a little relaxation every so often.~|~translationMissing
But you didn't get drunk and start a fight with anyone, or insult your hosts the Moon Clan?~|~translationMissing
Well, of course not. Even in my spare time I have to show a little decorum.~|~translationMissing
Set an example to the men and all that.~|~translationMissing
So you definitely didn't insult any of the Moon Clan at the feast?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely not.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, ok. You didn't see anyone else getting too rowdy did you?~|~translationMissing
No I didn't, and let me assure you that if I HAD they would have been most severely reprimanded by myself if not by the Captain.~|~translationMissing
I won't tolerate that kind of behaviour amongst my crew, even if they are in their free time.~|~translationMissing
Captain!~|~translationMissing
Mmmmm? You have information on what has happened to my ship for me?~|~translationMissing
Not as such, but I think I am onto a promising lead.~|~translationMissing
Apparently you all went to a big feast on Lunar Isle held by the Moon Clan when last you visited?~|~translationMissing
That is correct, yes. I was most pleasantly surprised by their hospitality.~|~translationMissing
Well, I don't want to go flinging out unfounded accusations or anything, but I have a strong suspicion that somebody at that feast did something that resulted in the Moon Clan getting offended and causing this jinx~|~translationMissing
to be placed on the ship.~|~translationMissing
In fact, it might not even be the ship that's been cursed, it could just be this person, or even some item they're carrying.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. You know, that's some good thinking. You're right, I suspect something like that did indeed happen.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea who this person may have been?~|~translationMissing
*Brakawk* Who's a jinx? Who's a jinx?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm afraid not. But with your permission, I will ask around the crew and see if anybody knows anything.~|~translationMissing
You obviously have my full permission, I have no desire for a jinx to be aboard my vessel, and if this has been the result of one of my crews thoughtless actions, then I will of course have to reprimand them severely.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I thought you might say that.~|~translationMissing
So let's begin with you~|~translationMissing
Where were you at the night of the feast, and what exactly were you doing?~|~translationMissing
WHAT? You suspect ME of having been jinxed???~|~translationMissing
No, not really, but it pays to be methodical in something like this.~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes, I understand. Well now...~|~translationMissing
As captain, I was first envoy to the Moon Clan and took seat with their dignitaries and the higher ranking members of their tribe, the Oneiromancer, Baba Yaga and so forth.~|~translationMissing
I do recall we had a most intriguing conversation about the history of their people, and their manufacturing of rune-stones for trade across the world.~|~translationMissing
So the rest of your crew weren't with you?~|~translationMissing
No, they were seated at a different table towards the back of the hall. I felt that they deserved a little recreation and relaxation time without their captain hanging around.~|~translationMissing
They're a good crew and have served me well!~|~translationMissing
So you don't actually know which of the crew were present at this feast? For all you know somebody might have slipped away from the feast and, oh I don't know, stolen some~|~translationMissing
artefact of theirs, or broken into somewhere they weren't supposed to go?~|~translationMissing
Well, of course that is all possible, but I wouldn't think any of my crew would be so rude as to break the gracious hospitality we had been offered!~|~translationMissing
We're pirates after all, not barbarians!~|~translationMissing
*Squawk* Not barbarians! Not barbarians! *Squawk*~|~translationMissing
Well, thank you for your time Captain, I'll see if anybody else noticed someone slipping away during the feast, or noticed someone behaving particularly badly towards any of the Moon Clan.~|~translationMissing
Please keep me informed of your discoveries. A jinx is an evil thing, and if one of my crew has brought it upon the Lady Zay, then I want to know about it.~|~translationMissing
Hi. That big feast you went to on Lunar Isle...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't remember much about it, I'd had a fair bit to drink.~|~translationMissing
Oh really? Do you think maybe while drunk you did something to offend them?~|~translationMissing
I don't see how, not with my condition.~|~translationMissing
Condition?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's a very rare medical condition.~|~translationMissing
When I'm drunk I become completely silent and immobile, and just sit quietly by myself until I have sobered up.~|~translationMissing
Erm, this is a genuine medical condition is it?~|~translationMissing
Oh, absolutely. I'm in the medical books and everything.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Okay then, I guess you're off the hook.~|~translationMissing
Hi. You know that big feast you went to on Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
I do indeed.~|~translationMissing
You were there all night with the rest of the crew?~|~translationMissing
I was.~|~translationMissing
Didn't see anyone leave early?~|~translationMissing
Not that I recall.~|~translationMissing
Didn't do anything to offend the Moon Clan, or see anyone else doing anything like that?~|~translationMissing
Nope, can't say as I did.~|~translationMissing
Hi. I don't suppose you saw anyone acting suspiciously at that big feast on Lunar Isle did you?~|~translationMissing
It was worth asking anyway, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hi. How's the search for the jinx going?~|~translationMissing
Not very well to be honest...~|~translationMissing
I think I've worked out that whatever happened to cause the Moon Clan offence and get this ship cursed somehow must have happened at that big feast you all went to, but I'm still no wiser as to what actually~|~translationMissing
happened...~|~translationMissing
Well, if you think it will help I can tell you everything I remember about the feast...?~|~translationMissing
Actually yeah, that might help give me some clue as to what happened. Please, go ahead.~|~translationMissing
Well now, let's see...~|~translationMissing
I recall that we all headed onto the island as we were due shore leave, and the Captain had arranged a big feast with the Moon Clan so that we could kick back and relax.~|~translationMissing
I think we were all there, but we had a table to ourselves where they just brought us food and wine all evening.~|~translationMissing
I remember Beefy the cook was being a bit of a killjoy and had stayed on board the ship, and the Captain was having some fancy meal with the Moon Clan toffs, but I'm pretty sure the rest of us were all at the meal...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, spirits got a little high later on after we'd finished eating, and I remember Tommy Two-times got out his old fiddle, and we sang and danced all through the night until daybreak when we made our way back~|~translationMissing
aboard the ship, and set sail.~|~translationMissing
When you say there were high spirits... You don't think perhaps you accidentally offended the Moon Clan somehow do you?~|~translationMissing
No, not at all! A couple of charming Moon Clan members came over and danced along with us!~|~translationMissing
Well, thanks for the help, but I don't think I'm any closer to solving this whole jinx mystery...~|~translationMissing
Well, I wish you luck, because it is very unnerving to think that I'm sailing on a cursed ship!~|~translationMissing
That big feast in Lunar Isle...~|~translationMissing
Yes? What about it?~|~translationMissing
Was everyone there?~|~translationMissing
Except for the Captain, I think so, yes.~|~translationMissing
And did you see anyone misbehaving particularly badly?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't think I did.~|~translationMissing
Hi. Did you find the jinx yet?~|~translationMissing
Funny you should ask, I have a few questions for you about that.~|~translationMissing
Oh no... Look, I'm SO SORRY, I SWEAR it wasn't my fault!~|~translationMissing
Erm, sorry, nothing, what did you want to know?~|~translationMissing
Oh, well, it was about that feast that you all went to on Lunar Isle.~|~translationMissing
Oh, the feast, right, yeah, I was definitely there at that, absolutely.~|~translationMissing
So... Did you notice anyone not there? Or anyone acting very rudely to the Moon Clan? Anything like that?~|~translationMissing
Um, no, no, everyone was there, yup.~|~translationMissing
Nothing at all?~|~translationMissing
Nope, we had a meal and then, um, some other stuff happened...~|~translationMissing
Um... And then... Er, we all went to bed for an early night.~|~translationMissing
Really? That doesn't sound much like the big raucous feast I've been hearing about from other people...~|~translationMissing
No, it TOTALLY happened EXACTLY like that. I swear.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Weird. Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree...~|~translationMissing
Yup, sounds like it, okay, well 'bye!~|~translationMissing
I have a couple of questions to ask you about the big feast on Lunar Isle you went to last time you went there.~|~translationMissing
Aaaahhhh yes.... I was quite taken with their hospitality!~|~translationMissing
Did you see anyone being rude to the Moon Clan at all?~|~translationMissing
Well, we were all in high spirits, but I certainly didn't see anything like that going on.~|~translationMissing
And I don't suppose you saw anyone slip away in the middle of the festival or anything?~|~translationMissing
Other than the First Mate, no I didn't see anyone slip away from the feast.~|~translationMissing
Okay tha- Wait, you say you saw the First Mate slip away in the middle of the feast?~|~translationMissing
That I did. I don't think he saw me see him leave, but it was definitely him.~|~translationMissing
I watched him head towards our ship, and he came back, oh, I don't know, twenty minutes later or so.~|~translationMissing
I doubt anyone else saw it, he just slipped away in the midst of the festivities.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, you've been very helpful.~|~translationMissing
And you're wanting what now?~|~translationMissing
I'll take you as far as Pirates' Cove. You'll have to find the rest of the way back yourself.~|~translationMissing
(Fade to black and the player is taken to Pirates' Cove.)~|~translationMissing
So we're here?~|~translationMissing
Yep. You're free to explore the island. Be careful though, the Moon Clan are very powerful, it wouldn't be wise to wrong them.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I'll keep that seal of passage close.~|~translationMissing
Can we head to Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
Sure matey!~|~translationMissing
(Cutscene of boat travelling to Lunar Isle.)~|~translationMissing
So you've plucked up the courage to come and confront that girl!~|~translationMissing
That I did, that I did!~|~translationMissing
She turned out to be really nice! She's joining us to become a pirate!~|~translationMissing
Really? And you're not sceptical about this? You know, after what she did last time?~|~translationMissing
She---has---no---spell---on---me.~|~translationMissing
Huh? Why are you talking like that?~|~translationMissing
Like someone else was talking for you. Are you sure she hasn't put a spell on you again? Did she wave a watch in front of your face? You know, tell you to look deep into her eyes?~|~translationMissing
I think you've been hypnotised. I wonder what happens if I click my fingers?~|~translationMissing
*click*~|~translationMissing
*Cluck* *cluck* *bwaarrk*~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. Oh well, I'm sure you'll learn one day.~|~translationMissing
Baba Yaga~|~translationMissing
Ah! A visitor from a distant land! How can I help?~|~translationMissing
Have you got anything to trade?~|~translationMissing
(Baba Yaga's Magic Shop. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
It's a very interesting house you have here.~|~translationMissing
It's a very interesting house you have here. Does he have a name?~|~translationMissing
Why of course. It's Berty.~|~translationMissing
Berty? Berty the Chicken leg house?~|~translationMissing
May I ask why?~|~translationMissing
It just has that certain ring to it, don't you think? Beeerteeee!~|~translationMissing
You're ins...~|~translationMissing
Insane? Very.~|~translationMissing
I'm good, thanks, bye.~|~translationMissing
I'm good thanks, bye.~|~translationMissing
You don't have permission yet to use this altar.~|~translationMissing
You have to earn the right to use the altar.~|~translationMissing
Hi~|~translationMissing
Managed to get the Dramen staff enchanted?~|~translationMissing
No, not yet. What do I have to do?~|~translationMissing
You are going to have to get hold of a Dramen staff first, which you should be able to get from Entrana. Take it to the air, fire, water and earth altars, in that order, to embue it with power to convert it into a~|~translationMissing
Lunar staff. Bring that back to me and then we can get on with the next stage.~|~translationMissing
And don't worry, you'll be able to do anything you can with the new enchanted version of the Dramen Staff as you could with it's ordinary form! Including visiting the lost city!~|~translationMissing
OK, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hi [sic]~|~translationMissing
I have indeed!~|~translationMissing
Well done, pass it here.~|~translationMissing
Now we can get on with the next stage - your suit! There are 8 parts to this.~|~translationMissing
Which would you like to hear about?~|~translationMissing
The helm~|~translationMissing
The helm.~|~translationMissing
This helm needs to be made from an ore you can only get from the mine on this island. You'll see some stalagmites that you can mine from.~|~translationMissing
The cape~|~translationMissing
The cape.~|~translationMissing
There should be one of these floating around somewhere. Talk to some of the people in the village and I am sure one of them will be able to help you.~|~translationMissing
The amulet~|~translationMissing
The amulet.~|~translationMissing
You should go and speak with Meteora, she always seems to be wearing one on her head for some reason. She might give that to you.~|~translationMissing
Next~|~translationMissing
Prev~|~translationMissing
The torso~|~translationMissing
The torso.~|~translationMissing
You'll find a monster called the Suqah that is indigenous to this island. You'll need one of their hides to make your torso, which you can tan only in this town.~|~translationMissing
(Shows previous-to-previous options)~|~translationMissing
The gloves~|~translationMissing
The gloves.~|~translationMissing
You'll find a monster called the Suqah that is indigenous to this island. You'll need one of their hides to make your gloves, which you can tan only in this town~|~translationMissing
The boots~|~translationMissing
The boots.~|~translationMissing
You'll find a monster called the Suqah that is indigenous to this island. You'll need one of their hides to make your boots, which you can tan only in this town~|~translationMissing

(Shows previous-to-previous-to-previous options)~|~translationMissing
The ring~|~translationMissing
The ring.~|~translationMissing
You should probably go and speak to Selene, she will be able to help you as she always seems to have bits and pieces like that hanging around.~|~translationMissing
Exit~|~translationMissing
Hi, could you refresh my memory~|~translationMissing
what am I supposed to be doing?~|~translationMissing
Well you need to be making your Lunar clothes.~|~translationMissing
I'm on the lookout for ceremonial clothing so I can visit my dreams. I don't suppose you could help me out?~|~translationMissing
Pauline Polaris~|~translationMissing
Ah, I know the ceremony very well. Maybe I can help. I do have a cape, but why would I want to give it to some random person off the streets?~|~translationMissing
Because you're a kind person and like helping people in need?~|~translationMissing
Nice try. But I am always glad to help a person in need, if they can demonstrate some insight.~|~translationMissing
I'm listening...~|~translationMissing
How about you try and guess my name!~|~translationMissing
Bob?~|~translationMissing
How rude!~|~translationMissing
Well you do seem to have a moustache growing.~|~translationMissing
Get out of my sight!~|~translationMissing
Pauline?~|~translationMissing
Pauline [sic]~|~translationMissing
Ah, you'd think so, but no. That is my alias. I want you to tell me my REAL name! I have one first name, and a triple barrel surname!~|~translationMissing
Oh no. Can't you give me some kind of clue?~|~translationMissing
Let's see...~|~translationMissing
OK. Change a letter from the word Dane to get my first name. The first part of my surname rhymes with wood, the third part rhymes with spade and the second rhymes with magic.~|~translationMissing
Her name is?~|~translationMissing
Dave Floob-Raid-Traid~|~translationMissing
Nope. Not even close.~|~translationMissing
Jave Nag-Brabik-Faide~|~translationMissing
Jane Blud-Hagic-Maid~|~translationMissing
That's it! Well done.~|~translationMissing
Woo hoo! Not the most normal name is it?~|~translationMissing
It's not my fault my parents had an over active imagination.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like they were totally insane.~|~translationMissing
Do you want this cape or not?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, yes please.~|~translationMissing
June Slagit-Magic-Aade~|~translationMissing
June Slagic-Lagic-Fade~|~translationMissing
Dave Flood-Raid-Traid~|~translationMissing
Jave Nud-Tragik-Baide~|~translationMissing
June Rlagic-Ladic-Bade~|~translationMissing
Dave Rlood-Raid-Thraid~|~translationMissing
Jave Bud-Tragik-Daide~|~translationMissing
Tina?~|~translationMissing
Ha! Nice try, but no.~|~translationMissing
Can I try guessing your name again to get the cape? And can I have the clues again?~|~translationMissing
I don't like to repeat myself, but...~|~translationMissing
Ah, a stranger to our island. What brings you here?~|~translationMissing
Well, I've actually come here on a diplomatic mission. I want to try and settle some of the disputes between the Fremenniks and your clan.~|~translationMissing
The Fremenniks? Pah! They are just too ignorant and stubborn to listen to anything we have to say - how can we possibly associate with a race that won't listen?~|~translationMissing
I think they are very eager to listen, but they feel like you are keeping secrets from them.~|~translationMissing
Secrets?~|~translationMissing
Yes, as in your magic ways. To be honest, I think it is fear of the unknown.~|~translationMissing
Well, when the day comes that a Fremennik can prove they have the patience and interest in learning our ways, then we will perhaps share our secrets.~|~translationMissing
I'm hoping I might be able to achieve that.~|~translationMissing
Good luck. It's far from simple.~|~translationMissing
Selene~|~translationMissing
Greetings sweetie. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me a bit about your people?~|~translationMissing
Ok. Like what?~|~translationMissing
How about the values of the Moon clan!~|~translationMissing
Let me see...  We value knowledge of self because it is this that gives us our strength! It is most important!~|~translationMissing
Well... I know things about myself. I know I like hot chocolate!~|~translationMissing
I was meaning something a little deeper than that.  We also like to see someone listen. You know how they say a wise man listens?~|~translationMissing
....~|~translationMissing
Did you hear me?~|~translationMissing
.... I'm listening.~|~translationMissing
Most wise.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a ring.~|~translationMissing
Well there are a great many rings darling, try to be more specific.~|~translationMissing
It's to go with the ceremonial clothes I need for visiting the dream land.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. I'm afraid to say I don't have one of those. But... I do know that my grandfather had such a ring, but he passed away a long time ago.~|~translationMissing
There is a chance he buried it though.~|~translationMissing
Buried it? Why would he do a thing like that?~|~translationMissing
He was an archaeologist. Well, more of a treasure hunter. When I was little he always used to bury items around the island and give me clues and maps to find them. If you're lucky you~|~translationMissing
might find one of those rings.~|~translationMissing
It's worth a shot.~|~translationMissing
I remember those days fondly, hours of digging around, dodging boulders, pits of snakes...~|~translationMissing
About that ring...~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes.~|~translationMissing
The clue I have written down here says~|~translationMissing
From water's source you should follow, crossing the western-most bridge and travelling further south- westerly to a bloom of blue.~|~translationMissing
Thanks... I hope.~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to talk to someone that calls me 'sweetie'!~|~translationMissing
No need to be rude dear!~|~translationMissing
Rimae Sirsalis~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the clothes store. How might I help you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What can you sell me?~|~translationMissing
You know the ceremonial clothes?~|~translationMissing
I certainly do! A real tricky set of garments to make.~|~translationMissing
Well that's unfortunate, because I was going to ask you how I might go about getting some.~|~translationMissing
All I can really help you out with is the tanning of the hides.~|~translationMissing
Sorry?~|~translationMissing
The ceremonial clothes are made from the hides of the Suqah monsters. Bring them to me and I will tan them for you. You can then craft them into the top, trousers, gloves and boots.~|~translationMissing
Ok.~|~translationMissing
It's an interesting creature the Suqah. You see, they have been indigenous to this island since we arrived. They seem to thrive of eating the minerals that exist in the mines below the town. We try our best to live in~|~translationMissing
harmony with them, because they provide us with a great many materials when they die, and in turn we have given them magic to help protect themselves.~|~translationMissing
Interesting.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) It's a very interesting island you have here.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm good thanks, bye.~|~translationMissing
Got any Suqah hides you want me to tan?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have any on me. Where can I get them from?~|~translationMissing
Just kill some of the Suqah monsters dotted around the outskirts of this island.~|~translationMissing
Ah! Thanks!~|~translationMissing
At 100 gold pieces per hide, that'll cost you... [number] gp.~|~translationMissing
That seems like a fair deal.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't seem to have enough money. I'll be right back!~|~translationMissing
A pleasure doing business with you!~|~translationMissing
Hi. Say, that's a nice amulet you're wearing.~|~translationMissing
Meteora~|~translationMissing
Wot?~|~translationMissing
On your head.~|~translationMissing
I ain't gat no amulet on me ed.~|~translationMissing

Oh ah, is a replacmant for me lucky tiara, yeah?~|~translationMissing
Your lucky tiara? What happened to it?~|~translationMissing
Ah, is bad, yeah? One o doews Suqah did nick it. Wish I ad it back, yeah.~|~translationMissing
I see wot I cen do, yeah? I mean, I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing

Not yet! Where did you say I can get it from?~|~translationMissing
One o doews Suqah did nick it. Hunt em down. Like urry it up yeah?~|~translationMissing
I have indeed, want to trade?~|~translationMissing
Sure, yeah, gimmie it yo.~|~translationMissing
There appears to be something in the dirt, but you have no space to hold it.~|~translationMissing
You've found a lunar ring!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a lunar helm in storage~|~translationMissing
I've made the Lunar Helm, but I've got it stored somewhere.~|~translationMissing
Well that's no good to me, best you go and get it.~|~translationMissing

) The helm~|~translationMissing
(If the player has already given the helm~|~translationMissing

If the player has given all the items~|~translationMissing
Ah you have everything! Good work!~|~translationMissing
I can give you back all the items you need now. Ah... you don't have enough space to carry them. There are eleven items in total, perhaps you should come back when you have space?~|~translationMissing
Er, how do you know how much space I have?~|~translationMissing
You're forgetting I can read you[sic] mind. I simply looked to see what you knew you were carrying, and analysed the average amount a person can carry and extrapolated...~|~translationMissing
Ok ok! I get the picture. I'll be right back.~|~translationMissing
Now, I'm going to give you some magic kindling from the first magic tree that ever grew. I shall also give you back your ceremonial clothes which I want you to put on, take hold of the Lunar staff, pour your potion on~|~translationMissing
this kindling and burn it on the giant brazier in the centre of town. If you've done all this correctly, you'll be transported to the land of dreams. I can't help you from there on, that all depends upon your~|~translationMissing
understanding of your self. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
You not been to dreamland yet?~|~translationMissing
What am I supposed to do again?~|~translationMissing
Take your kindling and put on your ceremonial clothes, take hold of the Lunar staff, pour your potion on this kindling and use it on the giant brazier in the centre of town. If you've done all this correctly, you'll be~|~translationMissing
transported to the land of dreams. I can't help you from there on, that all depends upon your understanding of your self. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the lunar staff~|~translationMissing
I've misplaced my staff.~|~translationMissing
I knew you'd do that, and I used my magic to teleport it back to me.~|~translationMissing
Erm, that doesn't sound too realistic. Thanks!~|~translationMissing
Look, do you want it or not?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, yes. Yes please.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'll have to come back when I have a space to carry one.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the lunar helm~|~translationMissing
I've lost my Lunar Helm.~|~translationMissing
(The Oneiromancer says a random replacement line.)~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately I don't have space to carry it.~|~translationMissing

If the player lost the lunar ring~|~translationMissing
I've lost my Lunar Ring.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the kindling~|~translationMissing
Can I have more kindling?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I don't seem to be able to get rid of them!~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the potion~|~translationMissing
I misplaced my potion of waking sleep.~|~translationMissing
Good job I have a spare one then isn't it!~|~translationMissing
I already knew that. I got one especially.~|~translationMissing
Well of course, I know that already, so I got a backup for you.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, good job I pre-empted you!~|~translationMissing
I know. Good job I knew you would drop it!~|~translationMissing
(Continues with above dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
If the brazier isn't lit~|~translationMissing
You need to light the brazier first.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing the full equipment~|~translationMissing
Huh? If I dreamt, I certainly don't remember anything. Wait a minute! I have to wear ALL the ceremonial gear AND be holding the staff.~|~translationMissing
(The player arrives in Dream Land.)~|~translationMissing
Huh? Where am I?~|~translationMissing
You can't take your clothes off in a dream. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you want to read and return to reality?~|~translationMissing
Let's see what this says... It seems to be my life story...~|~translationMissing
'It was in the age of the fifth that a child was born of simple beginnings. Even though he started his life with little money to his name, and nothing but a dream of adventure, he began his career by...'~|~translationMissing
(Player returns to Lunar Isle.)~|~translationMissing
Huh? Was it all a dream?~|~translationMissing
I've been to the dreamland!~|~translationMissing
What happened there?~|~translationMissing
Well, I didn't really manage to do anything, I left straight away.~|~translationMissing
Well that's no good.~|~translationMissing
(Continues above from lost item dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Man~|~translationMissing
Don't you know, you're in the land of your own dreams!~|~translationMissing
But you can't know you're in a dream whilst dreaming, you'd wake up!~|~translationMissing
Well, this is a waking sleep.~|~translationMissing
Ok. So how do I wake up?~|~translationMissing
Just use this lectern - it's the book of your life, all that has been, all that is and blank pages for all that will be. In reading this you will return your mind to reality and the conscious world.~|~translationMissing
This all seems very deep.~|~translationMissing
What am I supposed to do now?~|~translationMissing
That is totally up to you. This is a test, it wouldn't be fair if I gave you the answers now would it? But I can tell you that there is a selection of tasks that you can choose from. I like to call them, 'A game of chance',~|~translationMissing
'Communicating in numbers', 'Chop, chop, chop away', 'Where am I?', 'The race is on!', and 'Anything you can do...'.~|~translationMissing
This is the strangest place I have ever been.~|~translationMissing
Then you don't know your mind too well, do you!~|~translationMissing
Good point.~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Lady~|~translationMissing
Have you learnt anything?~|~translationMissing
Nothing so far.~|~translationMissing
Give it time.~|~translationMissing
I'm making progress in the dreamland!~|~translationMissing
Very good, but you haven't learnt anything yet?~|~translationMissing
We shall see.~|~translationMissing
If the player has finished the number puzzle~|~translationMissing
As previously discussed, I learned the importance of understanding others and my surroundings. That with this knowledge I can learn to help myself.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed the Woodcutting trial~|~translationMissing
I can still remember the lesson on the importance of knowing your own abilities and having confidence in them and yourself.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed the dice puzzle~|~translationMissing
There was that lesson with the dice, about appreciating the unknown, and respecting it as opposed to working against it.~|~translationMissing
If~|~translationMissing
I remember learning how important it is to know where you are and where you have been - your history. This helps you to plan out where you are going and to progress.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed the race~|~translationMissing
I already know the importance of seeing that not all paths are easy to walk, but if I stick at things I can succeed. What harms us just makes us stronger.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed the emote puzzle~|~translationMissing
I know that it is important to relate to others and that a lot of understanding and experiences can come from that.~|~translationMissing
For the spring platform to the emote island~|~translationMissing
Best you go tell that interesting character in the centre what you have just learned first.~|~translationMissing
For all other spring platform~|~translationMissing
You need to go tell that interesting character in the centre what you have just learned first.~|~translationMissing
You've learned all you need to from this area.~|~translationMissing
You should probably talk to that nearby character first.~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Perceptive~|~translationMissing
Why ello young [sir/madam]. Do yow like me troys?~|~translationMissing
Troys? Oh trees?~|~translationMissing
Ya, troys.~|~translationMissing
They're very nice, but you seem to have been chopping some down.~|~translationMissing
Well, ya. Hey, bet you canna chop dem troys.~|~translationMissing
I dunno.~|~translationMissing
Ya dunno? Wew you godda know what yow can dow. Ow can you judge wot you need ta practice or learn?~|~translationMissing
Fine. I can chop down trees.~|~translationMissing
Ok, chop logs and pile em int centar. First ta twenty wins.~|~translationMissing
So I have to chop down trees and place twenty logs in the centre, first to do so wins.~|~translationMissing
Wew ya.~|~translationMissing
Ok, let's go!~|~translationMissing
If the player has no axe~|~translationMissing
You got an axe?~|~translationMissing
Not one I can use, no.~|~translationMissing
We ow you gonna chop dem troys? I can give yow a bronze axe, but nowt more.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't have any space.~|~translationMissing
Go, go go!~|~translationMissing
Not just yet.~|~translationMissing
Av it your way!~|~translationMissing
Wot do yow wont nar?~|~translationMissing
So you want me to chop down trees?~|~translationMissing
Ya, chop logs and pile em int centar. First ta twenty wins.~|~translationMissing
Nothing, never mind.~|~translationMissing
Dat's two more logs from dem troys.~|~translationMissing
He's collected~|~translationMissing
[number] logs so far!~|~translationMissing
Stop distractin' me, go chop dem troys!~|~translationMissing
Oi! Get off moi troys!~|~translationMissing
You can't chop from his trees. Yours are at the other end of the island. Chop them down instead!~|~translationMissing
That's the woodcutter's pile. Why help him?~|~translationMissing
If the player has no logs~|~translationMissing
You have no logs.~|~translationMissing
If the player has logs~|~translationMissing
You deposited [number] logs, giving you [number] in total.~|~translationMissing
Har har, I did beet ya. You ain't gat no skiws.~|~translationMissing
I will beat you eventually!~|~translationMissing
Oh ah. Come on nen.~|~translationMissing
I give up.~|~translationMissing
Ah new ya wud. Best ya gow back den.~|~translationMissing
Wew done. I see you do have a good command ov yur abilitoys.~|~translationMissing
Remember this, yow need to know wot you can do so ya know what to learn. Now off ya go!~|~translationMissing
If you leave you'll have to start again!~|~translationMissing
That's ok.~|~translationMissing
I'll stay then.~|~translationMissing
I went to an area where I had to cut down trees as fast as I could! I had to do it against another man, and he kept asking me questions on what I could achieve.~|~translationMissing
And your thoughts on its meaning?~|~translationMissing
This is tricky. I think it was showing the importance of being able to know your own abilities and having confidence in them. You need this to beat opposition in whatever form that~|~translationMissing
might present itself.~|~translationMissing
I am very impressed.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed all the challenges~|~translationMissing
(Continues below from "That's it!".)~|~translationMissing
This looks like an interesting island.~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Expert~|~translationMissing
Oh it is.~|~translationMissing
Fancy a race!?!~|~translationMissing
What? That's a bit sudden. What kind of race?~|~translationMissing
I bet I can beat you to the other end of this island, I'll take the left route and you can take the right.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't seem fair - mine's all curvy and yours is straight.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's life I'm afraid, it's never as easy as you would like, you have to take the path that's dealt!~|~translationMissing
If you insist.~|~translationMissing
You'll see, so how about it?~|~translationMissing
(Race begins.)~|~translationMissing
Have it your way.~|~translationMissing
On your marks!~|~translationMissing
Get set!~|~translationMissing
Go?!!!~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello? Looks like you'll probably want to start again.~|~translationMissing
You beat me.~|~translationMissing
Woo hoo! Ha ha! You can try again if you want, but you'll never beat me, I'm far too fast!~|~translationMissing
Eat my dust!~|~translationMissing
You're right, I'm far too slow.~|~translationMissing
You give up too easily, but have it your way.~|~translationMissing
I won!~|~translationMissing
Noooo! How could you beat me?~|~translationMissing
I'm just making the most of the abilities I worked hard to develop. That's all!~|~translationMissing
True. A very important thing to remember! Now be gone!~|~translationMissing
I found myself on a sort of race course, facing an opponent. He had a straight route to travel, but mine was weaving and littered with obstacles. He had it easy and I seemed to have the hard route. But I still beat~|~translationMissing
him.~|~translationMissing
And what lesson do you suppose that teaches?~|~translationMissing
I had the more difficult path to travel, but I was faster and wanted it more - I hurried through while he just walked. That shows a few things, not all paths are easy to take, but if you want to succeed, and are willing to~|~translationMissing
put in the effort you can come out successful.~|~translationMissing
Very, very good!~|~translationMissing
It would be best to talk to that interesting fellow first.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. What's going on here?~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Numerator~|~translationMissing
127369186!~|~translationMissing
879732749 31764 762 908723089?~|~translationMissing
This is too weird. I...caaannooot....uuunnnnderstaaaand...youuuu!~|~translationMissing
Oh sorry. I'm not 7676908 used 768 to speaking 1324719 like this. It's not 90181 easy 901823 890 to talk 13127 without 90809 saying 90789 numbers.~|~translationMissing
That's ok. So what is the point of this place?~|~translationMissing
I dunno. Fancy a 4354353 game? Try and 353 complete these 43553 43543 sequences using 56367 the numbers around 24757 27 you! You will have to tell me the next two numbers in the sequence.~|~translationMissing
Erm, ok, I can't turn down an offer in this place.~|~translationMissing
[sequence]~|~translationMissing
127369186.~|~translationMissing
What was the sequence again?~|~translationMissing
What am I supposed to be doing?~|~translationMissing
Try and 295621 complete the sequences 2428428 I tell you using 792682 the numbers around 2 45785 57637 you!~|~translationMissing
Zero!~|~translationMissing
One!~|~translationMissing
Two!~|~translationMissing
Three!~|~translationMissing
Four!~|~translationMissing
Five!~|~translationMissing
Six!~|~translationMissing
Seven!~|~translationMissing
Eight!~|~translationMissing
Nine!~|~translationMissing
That's not it, we shall 324234 have to start 324 again. Try a new sequence!~|~translationMissing
That's correct! 96973 Onto the next 112908 number in the sequence!~|~translationMissing
So far we have the sequence~|~translationMissing
That's it! You've completed [number] [sequence/sequences]. [number] More to go. Time for 324324 the next sequence!~|~translationMissing
That's it! I think 34132421 you've got 12341 the hang of 124151 this now!~|~translationMissing
Phew!~|~translationMissing
Please remember this~|~translationMissing
You must 23235 be able to 23526 communicate and understand 26243 others, they 2627422 have wisdom and 4363472 experiences to 235725 share!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, yeah. What now?~|~translationMissing
Off you go!~|~translationMissing
I went to this area where I had to play this strange game involving numbers. I had to understand what this guy was saying, but he was mainly talking in numbers. It was most weird.~|~translationMissing
And did you learn anything from this? What do you suppose this part of your dream was trying to tell you?~|~translationMissing
To me it was about trying to understand someone else to proceed I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Exactly. By understanding others around you and through communication with your surroundings you can in turn learn a great deal about yourself.~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Mimic~|~translationMissing
Follow my lead!~|~translationMissing
Huh, wait a sec, who are...~|~translationMissing
See what you will learn! Tee hee hee.~|~translationMissing
You're not all there are you?~|~translationMissing
Hey! This is your dream!~|~translationMissing
So what do you say?~|~translationMissing
Suppose I may as well have a go.~|~translationMissing
Follow!~|~translationMissing
I think I'll pass.~|~translationMissing
I think i'll pass.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's no fun.~|~translationMissing
NO no no!~|~translationMissing
For the first right emote~|~translationMissing
Well done!~|~translationMissing
For the second right emote~|~translationMissing
Woo hoo!~|~translationMissing
For the third right emote~|~translationMissing
That's it!~|~translationMissing
For the forth right emote~|~translationMissing
Nice one!~|~translationMissing
For the fifth right emote~|~translationMissing
Yep, you've got it!~|~translationMissing
You soon picked that up! Can you see how important it is to be able to communicate and relate with others? You can gain a lot of knowledge from it.~|~translationMissing
I see. There's a lot more to communication than words. Thank you.~|~translationMissing
Ok, back you go!~|~translationMissing
I found myself meeting a man that only seemed to interact using body language. I basically mimicked what he was doing and before I knew what was happening, it felt like we were friends. It was very strange.~|~translationMissing
That's dreams for you. But there must have been some logic behind it!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I think it was illustrating the importance of being able to relate to others, and that a great deal of thoughts and emotions are shared between people. We can learn a lot from each other, so I suppose friend~|~translationMissing
relations are important.~|~translationMissing
That seems about right to me.~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Fluke~|~translationMissing
Let's have a game, Rhysdog3! It's a game of luck! Or is it...~|~translationMissing
Erm... I'm scared. What?~|~translationMissing
Look around and you'll see a selection of dice. I will call out a number. You must then roll over the dice to get the top faces adding up to create that number. For example. If I said '15', you'd have to turn over the dice~|~translationMissing
to get the following numbers at the top~|~translationMissing
6 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15. There are of course many ways to get the number 15, but the dice are perhaps not all that random!~|~translationMissing
The number you want is~|~translationMissing
[number]~|~translationMissing
What lucky question will I get?~|~translationMissing
What number am I trying to make up?~|~translationMissing
The number [number]!~|~translationMissing
Look around and you'll see a selection of dice. What I will do is call out a number. You must then roll over the dice to get the top faces adding up to create that number. For example. If I said '15', you'd have to turn~|~translationMissing
over the dice to get the following numbers at the top~|~translationMissing
Well Done! The next number is~|~translationMissing
The next number is~|~translationMissing
You've done it! Good work. Remember~|~translationMissing
It is important to respect that luck plays a part in things, but that doesn't mean there is not reason and logic behind your surroundings. If you look hard enough you can see the~|~translationMissing
reason.~|~translationMissing
Ok. Thanks!~|~translationMissing
I visited this strange platform covered in dice. I was then challenged to turn over selected dice in what seemed like a game of chance. But I think there was some logic behind it all.~|~translationMissing
What do you suppose that means then?~|~translationMissing
Got it! You have to appreciate that there is always a certain level of the unknown in life, but there is always an answer, you just have to play the game and have hope that you'll succeed.~|~translationMissing
Spot on.~|~translationMissing
Ethereal Guide~|~translationMissing
You know everything is a journey!~|~translationMissing
A journey? Don't talk to me about journeys! I'm surprised I have any feet left with all the walking I have to do!~|~translationMissing
I know. I know. But at every step, it was important that you knew where you had been, where you were and where you were headed.~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I spend a lot of my time not knowing a single one of those things!~|~translationMissing
Let's see how you fare in here. Try and get to the other side and you'll see what I mean.~|~translationMissing
You can't jump diagonally!~|~translationMissing
Dream guide~|~translationMissing
Well done! So tell me, what have you learned?~|~translationMissing
I think I understand better now, it is very useful to be able to remember where you have been, where you are and where you are headed. I needed all three to progress, unless I worked with trial and error, which~|~translationMissing
you do sometimes have to do I suppose when looking into the future as the future is undecided.~|~translationMissing
Very deep! Excellent, I'm glad you learnt something. I shall send you back!~|~translationMissing
I went to this place with loads of platforms. I had to jump across them, but some of them weren't real and I fell away as I stepped on them. I had to remember where I was on the grid, and recall the route I was~|~translationMissing
taking.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. Do you have any interpretations?~|~translationMissing
I suppose there is a great deal of importance in knowing where you are and where you are going. Having goals and remembering your past. It helps you make the right decisions!~|~translationMissing
Bingo!~|~translationMissing
That's it! You've learnt the 6 core lessons~|~translationMissing
Make sense of others to understand yourself, you must be able to relate to others, you must use your abilities to progress, you must be aware of your past and~|~translationMissing
present to help you in the future, you must harness your confidence, and you must appreciate the unknown.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Now what?~|~translationMissing
There is one more challenge you must face. I can't tell you what to expect, you are still being tested.~|~translationMissing
Would you like to face your final challenge?~|~translationMissing
Of course. I'm ready.~|~translationMissing
I'm not ready yet, give me a some time.~|~translationMissing
I'm not ready yet, give me a little more time.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. So you have learnt the 6 core lessons~|~translationMissing
present to help you in the future, you must harness your confidence, and you must appreciate the unknown. Because magic is within, by understanding these lessons you can access the power of the moon~|~translationMissing
clan. You are almost finished here. There is one more challenge which you must face.~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you can give me any help?~|~translationMissing
Sorry. So how about it, are you ready?~|~translationMissing
I've completed a few tasks in the dreamland! I've learned a variety of things. But I've still got one last thing to do.~|~translationMissing
Well best you return and do that before you tell me what you have learned. I'd rather you learn all you can before you talk to me about it.~|~translationMissing
OK.~|~translationMissing
Now is not the time!~|~translationMissing
You've been teleported for some unknown reason...~|~translationMissing
Me~|~translationMissing
Are you me? Am I you?~|~translationMissing
Are you me? Am I you? [sic]~|~translationMissing
Leave me alone... Me...~|~translationMissing
You can't teleport now, you need to wake up first!~|~translationMissing
I did it! I confronted myself!~|~translationMissing
Well done, I think your lesson is complete, best you wake yourself up! Go read the book on the lectern.~|~translationMissing
I've done it! I understand now!~|~translationMissing
You do, I'm not sure I believe you. Tell me what you've learnt.~|~translationMissing
To start with, six very important things that I needed to know of myself~|~translationMissing
Make sense of others to understand yourself, you must be able to relate to others, you must use your abilities to progress, you must be aware of~|~translationMissing
your past and present to help you in the future, you must harness your confidence, and you must appreciate the unknown.~|~translationMissing
That's great! I would never have imagined someone from mainland could have had such an open mind to learn such things! I shall spread the word among our people. After this I can't see why we can't start to get~|~translationMissing
along.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. I think if you make contact with the Fremennik, and tell them your willingness to communicate and share, you'll find plenty of eager ears.~|~translationMissing
Well done! You must be rewarded for this great deed. You're now more than welcome to use the altar behind me to craft the astral runes that we use here on the island. These runes will allow you to use a new set of~|~translationMissing
spells. Simply pray at the altar behind me to gain the knowledge.~|~translationMissing
Hi, how are things going?~|~translationMissing
Well hopefully a lot better now that you've initiated the calm between the Moon Clan and the Fremenniks. Remember, if you want to use our Lunar Spells at any time, pray at the altar beside me and you can modify~|~translationMissing
your knowledge!~|~translationMissing
Well if it isn't [Fremennik name]. I've heard of your exploits in the Lunar Isles!~|~translationMissing
Already? News really does travel fast!~|~translationMissing
Thank you so very much, I think we can really make progress now.~|~translationMissing
No worries. I am pleased I could help.~|~translationMissing
If the player has no seal of passage~|~translationMissing
Oh, erm, could you help me out with a Seal of Passage?~|~translationMissing
Seal of Passage, well I suppose so.~|~translationMissing

Always humans running through Burntmeat's kitchen these days. It never used to be like dis.~|~translationMissing
Well, don't get any funny ideas! You promised you'd never cook another human if I helped My Arm grow goutweed.~|~translationMissing
An' dat promise I is keeping! Never another human shall Burntmeat cook. Human taste plenty good raw if you add enough goutweed.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, Burntmeat been hoping to see you again. Got important visitor here, an' we need your help.~|~translationMissing
Wolfbone~|~translationMissing
It good to meet you, [player name]. Burntmeat tells me you very helpful human.~|~translationMissing
So, you ready for another quest, [player name]? You get good reward if you help us.~|~translationMissing
Will Burntmeat reward me with burnt meat again?~|~translationMissing
Will Burntmeat reward me with burnt meat again? I've been here before, you know!~|~translationMissing
Silly human pretends he/she not liking lovely burnt meat! But okay, Burntmeat promises not to give you more burnt meat.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll take your quest.~|~translationMissing
Totally not interested.~|~translationMissing
Good human! You not regret dis, Burntmeat is sure.~|~translationMissing
So tell me about this quest.~|~translationMissing
I come from troll town called Weiss, up in cold mountains to the north. We heard of trolls here, an' wanted to meet.~|~translationMissing
Our chief, Mother, want to trade. Weiss trolls invented stuff maybe these trolls want. An' maybe these trolls invented stuff we want in Weiss.~|~translationMissing
So Mother want these trolls to send ambassador up to Weiss, maybe teach us their inventions, an' in return I teach Weiss inventions here.~|~translationMissing
So you're planning on sending someone to Weiss to teach them the technology invented by the Stronghold trolls?~|~translationMissing
That correct! An' Burntmeat decided to send My Arm. He best troll to go to Weiss and teach stuff there. He already training assistant to take over goutweed farming.~|~translationMissing
Why in the heck would you choose My Arm?~|~translationMissing
My Arm is good choice! He been to distant lands, met strange people, come back with new learnings for Stronghold. He obviously best troll for dis job.~|~translationMissing
Wolfbone come from Weiss over icy mountains, but you not go that route. It too hard for Stronghold trolls. We not practiced climbing icy mountains.~|~translationMissing
That correct. You find boat and go to Weiss by sea instead. Wolfbone tell you the way...~|~translationMissing
Wolfbone describes how to reach Weiss by sea.~|~translationMissing
Okieday, now you go fetch My Arm an' tell him where he got to go.~|~translationMissing
My Arm~|~translationMissing
Hey, [player name].~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How's your farming coming along?~|~translationMissing
I'm doing another quest for Burntmeat.~|~translationMissing
Dat nice. Burntmeat always cook lovely burnt meat for you when you help us before.~|~translationMissing
Yes, he did. Lots of burnt meat filling my inventory. That was Burntmeat's reward.~|~translationMissing
What Burntmeat need from you dis time?~|~translationMissing
There's a troll town called Weiss, up in the north. They want a troll from the Stronghold to go and teach them about the technology you've invented here.~|~translationMissing
'An Burntmeat choose My Arm to go? Dat sound like great honour! It make good sense, too - My Arm got all da goutweed knowledge.~|~translationMissing
Stronghold trolls not really invented much else. We know bashing things with rocks make 'em dead, but maybe Weiss trolls know dat already.~|~translationMissing
But dat not a problem, [player name]. My Arm know lots 'bout growing goutweed. It gonna be fine.~|~translationMissing
Don't you mind leaving your home?~|~translationMissing
Eh... My Arm not mind. My Arm like seeing places, like dat jungle village where da nice people give us goutweed stuff.~|~translationMissing
Those nice people might have given you anything you liked, if it would make you stop damaging their village.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, My Arm not mind going to Weiss. No family here now, not since My Other Arm died. Got apprentice ready to take over goutweed farming. Dis gonna be fine.~|~translationMissing
So My Arm very happy to go teach goutweed farming to trolls in Weiss. It so exciting!~|~translationMissing
Isn't there anything else you can teach them?~|~translationMissing
Wolfbone said we should go by sea.~|~translationMissing
I'll be off.~|~translationMissing
Wolfbone said we should go by sea. Apparently the mountains are too hard to cross, so he told me how to get there by sea.~|~translationMissing
My Arm been on boat before, an' not like it. But My Arm not like crossing cold mountain either... eh, we better go by boat. You got a boat ready?~|~translationMissing
Okieday, My Arm know how to find it. It on coast near smelly fur-wearing human town you call Rellekka. See you in a bit.~|~translationMissing
My Arm look forward to getting on with da job when you ready!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) About that farming book you had...~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
My Arm very excited 'bout going to Weiss to teach stuff to da trolls. Better hope dey like hearing 'bout goutweed.~|~translationMissing
Meet me at Larry's boat.~|~translationMissing
Meet me at Larry's boat. I helped him rather a lot with those penguins, so hopefully he'll let us borrow it. It's west of the mountains, near Rellekka.~|~translationMissing
My Arm know da place, it on coast near smelly fur- wearing human town you call Rellekka. See you in a bit.~|~translationMissing
I can't speak right now. I have too much to do. I will contact you when the time is right.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'd like to travel to the iceberg.~|~translationMissing
Can I transport My Arm in your boat?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, I'm sure you've transported your arm every time you've used my boat. Isn't it always attached to the rest of your body?~|~translationMissing
My Arm is a troll.~|~translationMissing
Your arm is... a troll? It's really not. I can see both of them. Sorry, have you had your brain shrunk into a penguin suit too many times?~|~translationMissing
This kind of thing happens a lot when I take My Arm out to places.~|~translationMissing
You take your arm out to places? And what the heck is THAT?~|~translationMissing
My Arm arrives, frightening Larry.~|~translationMissing
My Arm here!~|~translationMissing
Never mind, I just need to borrow your boat.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I distinctly heard you say you wanted to transport your arm in it. Have you had your brain shrunk into a penguin suit too many times? I don't lend my boat to mad people.~|~translationMissing
That thing is an arm?~|~translationMissing
Dat 'thing' is a troll, an' My Arm not like being called a thing!~|~translationMissing
This is My Arm, yes. We'd like to borrow your boat, so we can visit more trolls in the north. My Arm is going to teach them to farm.~|~translationMissing
My Arm is a farmer, yup! Got a farm.~|~translationMissing
Your arm's arm has a farm... Please make this stop!~|~translationMissing
Eh, [player name], My Arm thinks dis human kinda dumb. Can we use boat or not? My Arm getting bored.~|~translationMissing
You want my boat? Yes, yes, take my boat and go a very long way from me! And take your arm with you!~|~translationMissing
You and My Arm sail to Weiss.~|~translationMissing
Are we dere yet?~|~translationMissing
You and My Arm continue sailing to Weiss.~|~translationMissing
You going too slow. Let My Arm drive!~|~translationMissing
Um... well, let's see how this goes...~|~translationMissing
You and My Arm somehow sail backwards.~|~translationMissing
Is we going backwards?~|~translationMissing
My Arm didn't know boats could go backwards.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I should drive again.~|~translationMissing
You gettin' angry with My Arm again?~|~translationMissing
Dis boat smell of bird poo.~|~translationMissing
We didn't have many choices.~|~translationMissing
So... are we dere yet?~|~translationMissing
You reach the coast near Weiss.~|~translationMissing
Well, we here. My Arm not enjoyed boat ride. Weiss must be up top of cliff, but My Arm not gonna be able to climb up.~|~translationMissing
Wolfbone said we should moor here and go up the cliffs.~|~translationMissing
He might have assumed you're good at climbing, since you actually live on a mountain!~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'll have a look around.~|~translationMissing
My Arm not gonna be able to climb dat. Maybe you look for other way first?~|~translationMissing
My Arm not gonna be able to get through dat hole. It got all rocks in da way. You wanna clear it?~|~translationMissing
I can't see whether it's safe to clear the blockage from out here, or whether that would collapse the cave.~|~translationMissing
Maybe if I got into the cave from above, I could clear it more safely from inside.~|~translationMissing
A cave! Maybe I can go down there, and find a way to mine through the blocked passage from the inside, to let My Arm in...~|~translationMissing
I'm supposed to be introducing My Arm to this town as their new friend. Maybe it'd be worth talking to the inhabitants before assuming I need to break into their home.~|~translationMissing
Boulder~|~translationMissing
What you want, human? You not coming in. Weiss is troll town - humans not welcome.~|~translationMissing
My Arm has come to make friends with you.~|~translationMissing
Boulder not sure exactly what you offering, human, but it not sound like something Boulder want to happen.~|~translationMissing
But My Arm's come a very long way for this, and he's very excited about what he can teach you.~|~translationMissing
Boulder still not sure what you offering, human, but you definitely not doing it in here. Go away!~|~translationMissing
Wolfbone's sent My Arm from the Troll Stronghold.~|~translationMissing
Human arm might taste good, maybe, so if Wolfbone sent your arm as snack, we happy to take it an' eat it.~|~translationMissing
I'm not letting you eat my arm.~|~translationMissing
Urgh - human arm attached to human body with human mouth what keep talking an' talking. Shut up an' go away.~|~translationMissing
You only need to let My Arm in, not me.~|~translationMissing
Human sound confused about how body work. See, mortal body is intrinsic part of mortal being. It not like we got our souls floating up in da sky controlling bodies like puppets.~|~translationMissing
We mortal beings - troll, human, goat - we are our bodies, and our bodies are us. You human got dumb ideas 'bout mind/body dualism.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, Boulder not here to talk ontological distinction between mind an' matter, especially with dumb human who not know what his arm is. So push off.~|~translationMissing
I'll be back!~|~translationMissing
Maybe next time you come, Boulder get ear-plugs.~|~translationMissing
Squirrel~|~translationMissing
Human intruder!~|~translationMissing
Several trolls follow you into the caverns.~|~translationMissing
The trolls are coming - you'd better hide!~|~translationMissing
If the player fails to hide in time~|~translationMissing
Icicle~|~translationMissing
Got ya!~|~translationMissing
You're knocked unconscious and chucked out of Weiss.~|~translationMissing
If the player successfully hid in time~|~translationMissing
It's a good thing I got in here before those trolls arrived!~|~translationMissing
Well, there's the cave exit I need to clear. Then My Arm can get into this cave.~|~translationMissing
The Weiss trolls won't trust me until they can see I've really brought a troll here. But they won't be able to see My Arm unless he walks far enough into the cave.~|~translationMissing
The water looks shallow at the north end. Maybe it can be filled up with rocks, or something, so My Arm could walk further into the cave...~|~translationMissing
... and those trolls seem to have plenty of rocks to throw into the water...~|~translationMissing
I reckon those stepping stones will let My Arm enter the cave far enough for the trolls to see him! I'd better clear that obstruction so he can get in.~|~translationMissing
T'anks, [player name].~|~translationMissing
My Arm uses the stepping stones to walk further.~|~translationMissing
Pebble~|~translationMissing
Stop chuckin' rocks - it a troll! Bring him to Mother!~|~translationMissing
Mother~|~translationMissing
Welcome to Weiss, troll. I am Mother. Mother sorry about your trouble getting in here.~|~translationMissing
We not trust humans. Also, your human keep talking about its arm, and we not want mad human in our town. But now Mother knows human is your servant, we let it come and go freely.~|~translationMissing
T'anks, Mother. [player name] is helpful human.~|~translationMissing
I'm not his servant.~|~translationMissing
Humans are not welcome in Weiss. If you are not the servant of this troll, you should go away and never return.~|~translationMissing
Why are you called Mother, Mother?~|~translationMissing
A troll child is named after the first thing they try to eat. This is tradition of troll people. My full name is Mother's Left One.~|~translationMissing
* cough *~|~translationMissing
Let's move on with the chat.~|~translationMissing
This here is Don't Know What, loyal bodyguard and chief sentry. He like a son to Mother.~|~translationMissing
Don't Know What~|~translationMissing
This old troll is Odd Mushroom. He is big clever-clogs, and it makes him talk funny, but Mother puts up with it. Odd Mushroom invents stuff for Mother.~|~translationMissing
Odd Mushroom~|~translationMissing
It's a real pleasure to meet you, My Arm. And you too, [player name]. I look forward tremendously to working with you both.~|~translationMissing
And here come Mother's daughter, Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake~|~translationMissing
Hello Father.~|~translationMissing
Oh... [player name]... look!~|~translationMissing
Hello, visitor. I am Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
My Arm very pleased to see Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
Your arm is pleased to see me?~|~translationMissing
My Arm got named My Arm by my dad, after My Arm tried to nibble his arm... sorry, My Arm not want to bore you.~|~translationMissing
You are not boring - I like how My Arm talks. My father is Mother. He named me after a snowflake.~|~translationMissing
Dat a pretty name. For a pretty troll. Maybe you get to know My Arm better soon?~|~translationMissing
I would like to spend more time with My Arm, yes.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake! We men got business to talk! Shut up and get out.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, Father.~|~translationMissing
Aww...~|~translationMissing
Snowflake leaves.~|~translationMissing
You really shouldn't speak to her that way, Mother. It's incredibly rude.~|~translationMissing
You shut up too, or Mother break your clever-clogs head open an' see how smart your brain is when it outside your skull!~|~translationMissing
Snowflake got to respect boss, an' that is Mother. When Mother retire as boss, Don't Know What will marry Snowflake. Then he will be boss, an' Snowflake got to respect him.~|~translationMissing
She doesn't want that, you know.~|~translationMissing
This your last warning - shut up! Weiss needs strong boss - that is how we survive. For now, Mother is strongest boss. Some day, Don't Know What will be strongest boss. Otherwise trolls die out.~|~translationMissing
So, arm troll, you come from Stronghold to share what you know. What you got?~|~translationMissing
In return, we can teach you all about the special fires we've invented. They can be very useful.~|~translationMissing
Well, My Arm know 'bout goutweed farming.~|~translationMissing
That sounds jolly exciting!~|~translationMissing
Farming? That a stupid skill for a man-troll. Proper man-troll should use his muscles. You teach us something better than that, or you get out and not come back!~|~translationMissing
Uh... [player name], what do we do now? If he kick us out, My Arm never gonna see Snowflake again. Help!~|~translationMissing
Tell him goutweed is delicious.~|~translationMissing
Yeah! Mother should try goutweed. It taste so good! Everything taste better with goutweed, an' My Arm know how to grow it.~|~translationMissing
Mother is not interested in eating stupid vegetables. Mother likes wolf flesh, freshly killed, with blood running down Mother's jaw.~|~translationMissing
Mother gets real warm fuzzy feeling inside, eating furry wolf.~|~translationMissing
You better have something else to offer, or you go home an' stop wasting Mother's time.~|~translationMissing
If all options have been chosen~|~translationMissing
Tell him how tough Stronghold trolls are.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, we really good at combat. Trolls near Stronghold, dey chuck rocks really hard. An' My Arm helped [player name] save da goutweed patch from big flappy bird thing!~|~translationMissing
Mother has trolls already who chuck rocks really hard. Also Mother has seen birds - they are not scary.~|~translationMissing
Dis bird - it were really big though...~|~translationMissing
Mother is not impressed. Have Stronghold trolls nothing else to offer?~|~translationMissing
What we do now, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Tell him to show respect to his daughter.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, My Arm not like how Mother talks to Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
Dis not working, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Tell him you love his daughter!~|~translationMissing
Really? If My Arm start talking' bout what My Arm want to do with his daughter, he probably gonna get angry or freaked out.~|~translationMissing
I meant on a more emotional level...~|~translationMissing
Mother can hear you! It not matter. Mother's daughter, Snowflake, will marry Don't Know What. Then he can be boss when Mother retires.~|~translationMissing
Trolls need strong boss. Mother kept trolls alive through Mother's strength! Otherwise trolls would have died long ago. Once Mother retires, Don't Know What is strongest.~|~translationMissing
So Don't Know What will marry Snowflake and be boss of Weiss. No more talk on this! You arm troll, you teach us something good or go home!~|~translationMissing
I'll get back to you in a bit.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, Mother, My Arm got nothing else. But My Arm not want to leave - can My Arm stay please?~|~translationMissing
Arm troll is useless. Get out of here!~|~translationMissing
Oh, [player name], My Arm is being sent home. Stupid big Mother not interested in goutweed. My Arm would prefer to stay with Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
I wish My Arm did not have to leave.~|~translationMissing
Mother wasn't very nice to Snowflake in there.~|~translationMissing
My father, Mother, did not like me talking to My Arm. Whoever marries me will rule Weiss after Father retires or dies, and Father wishes that to be Don't Know What, the biggest sentry.~|~translationMissing
My Arm not happy 'bout dat.~|~translationMissing
My Arm is not as big as Don't Know What, and I think he is less strong too. Father would not approve of him as a suitor for me.~|~translationMissing
Mother should mind own business, an' not tell Snowflake who to marry.~|~translationMissing
Father is... horrible to me.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake, you seemed to like My Arm.~|~translationMissing
He is different from other man-trolls. I know already that I want My Arm by my side.~|~translationMissing
My Arm want that too.~|~translationMissing
Odd Mushroom, why are you here with us?~|~translationMissing
Oh, Mother's been annoying me for years. He doesn't care about anything except fighting. Whatever I invent for him, he ignores it completely if he can't use it in combat.~|~translationMissing
That's why he dismissed My Arm's farming expertise too. He's really holding Weiss back. Trolls should aspire to be more than just lumbering monsters.~|~translationMissing
Mother won't change himself, and none of us are strong enough to force him, especially with Don't Know What guarding him... but maybe My Arm can help.~|~translationMissing
It sounds like you want My Arm to overthrow Mother for you.~|~translationMissing
I deplore violence. No, I want Mother to let Snowflake marry My Arm, instead of marrying Don't Know What. Snowflake's smart, and she'll rule us better.~|~translationMissing
But if she marries Don't Know What, he'll insist on ruling Weiss himself like Mother does - and he's no better than Mother. So I'd rather My Arm stayed here and married Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
The choice should be from my heart, not from anyone else - though I like this plan very much!~|~translationMissing
My Arm like plan too. My Arm marry Snowflake, an' she become boss of town, an' My Arm teach town to farm goutweed. Yup, good plan.~|~translationMissing
So we will need Mother to gain respect for My Arm, so that he'll consent to the marriage.~|~translationMissing
How can we get Father to respect My Arm? He likes Don't Know What because Don't Know What is strong, but My Arm is... different.~|~translationMissing
Can I kill Mother?~|~translationMissing
Can I kill Mother? That usually solves problems in quests.~|~translationMissing
I would prefer you not to kill Father. He is cruel, but he is my blood.~|~translationMissing
Let's not have any unnecessary killing.~|~translationMissing
Can My Arm fight Mother?~|~translationMissing
He really big though.~|~translationMissing
I do not think that would be wise, dear.~|~translationMissing
Can My Arm fight Don't Know What?~|~translationMissing
He look dumb, but he kinda big.~|~translationMissing
He is dumb, but he is big. I think this would not work.~|~translationMissing
Does Mother respect anything except fighting?~|~translationMissing
Mother's strength saved this tribe, in the past. That's how he became chief. He truly believes that if our chief is not physically strong, we will die out.~|~translationMissing
You see, we have not always lived in Weiss. We used to live further south, near the dwarf town they call Keldagrim, until we were driven out...~|~translationMissing
Once upon a time in Keldagrim...~|~translationMissing
A cutscene of the past plays, where the Black Guard were attacked by ice trolls. The Wise Young Man saves the day, driving the trolls away.~|~translationMissing
That Wise Young Man drove us out into the barren icy mountains. Without Mother's strength to overcome obstacles and catch food, I believe we would have perished.~|~translationMissing
Did you say the dwarves called that human the 'Wise Young Man'?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. They treated him as a great hero after he drove us out of our tunnels.~|~translationMissing
I know that Wise Young Man you mentioned! I did a quest with him where we saved a fishing colony. He's the Wise Old Man now.~|~translationMissing
You know the mortal enemy of our people! What did you do in the fishing colony with him?~|~translationMissing
We killed a lot of trolls.~|~translationMissing
Very well. That Wise Young Man killed many of our people, and I am disappointed that you worked with him, but I shall overlook it for My Arm.~|~translationMissing
So if you all hate dis old man, how about My Arm kill him? Then Mother gonna really like My Arm! Old human sounds easy to kill.~|~translationMissing
I did some fishing and fetched some stuff.~|~translationMissing
Very well. That Wise Young Man killed many of our people, and I am glad that you are different from him.~|~translationMissing
Yes! If you kill the human who drove us out from the Keldagrim tunnels, Mother will call you a hero and be pleased for you to marry Snowflake. Can you go and do it?~|~translationMissing
No, My Arm can't kill the Wise Old Man! The Wise Old Man is far too powerful.~|~translationMissing
Dat a shame. But he know you, [player name], an' you helped him in fishy colony place. Maybe you ask him a favour now?~|~translationMissing
You're suggesting I ask him to let you kill him, just so that you can marry Snowflake?~|~translationMissing
Please!~|~translationMissing
Ah, no. He surely won't agree to die. But perhaps he can pretend he's dead, while My Arm tricks Mother into believing it. Can you ask him, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
This is a very strange request!~|~translationMissing
Please ask him, [player name]! For me and My Arm!~|~translationMissing
I'll be back in a moment.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake can leave with us.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake can leave with us. Then she and My Arm can be together, in the Troll Stronghold.~|~translationMissing
Um... thank you for the offer, but...~|~translationMissing
Ah. Mother is our chief, and as his daughter, Snowflake is the heir to the throne of Weiss. So Snowflake or her future husband will rule this town. My Arm may be a charming chappy...~|~translationMissing
T'anks, mushroom troll.~|~translationMissing
... but Snowflake shouldn't be expected to run away from Weiss, abandoning what's hers. No, we should try to keep My Arm here.~|~translationMissing
Have you asked the Wise Old Man to help us? We only need him to pretend to be dead, so My Arm can claim credit for killing him, and impress Father.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that would impress Mother very much.~|~translationMissing
I've not discussed it with him yet.~|~translationMissing
Greetings, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Ask about My Arm.~|~translationMissing
It's good of you to pop in, [player name]. What brings you to Draynor today?~|~translationMissing
My Arm needs your help.~|~translationMissing
You should see a doctor about your arm.~|~translationMissing
Not my arm, I mean My Arm.~|~translationMissing
... you should see a doctor about your brain.~|~translationMissing
That's not helping.~|~translationMissing
Can you pretend you're dead?~|~translationMissing
That looked very strange.~|~translationMissing
You asked me to pretend I'm dead. That's what I imagine it would be like.~|~translationMissing
Let me explain... A troll called My Arm needs to pretend he's killed you. This will impress his girlfriend's father, Mother.~|~translationMissing
His girlfriend's father, Mother?~|~translationMissing
Yes. You drove Mother's tribe of trolls out of the dwarf tunnels near Keldagrim, long ago, and Mother's hated you ever since.~|~translationMissing
I remember driving trolls out of those tunnels, yes. So now there's a troll called My Arm who wants to pretend he's killed me in revenge, to impress his girlfriend's father, who is called Mother?~|~translationMissing
That's right. If Mother thinks My Arm has killed you, he'll let My Arm marry his daughter, Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
Hmmmph. That's quite a big favour you're asking. I've spent much of my life saving people from monsters like that, not providing family mediation services for them.~|~translationMissing
You'll get rewarded if you help.~|~translationMissing
I don't think so, thank you. In my experience, a troll's idea of a quest reward is probably something useless like a pile of burnt meat.~|~translationMissing
You owe me a favour after the Fishing Colony quest.~|~translationMissing
I suppose you did save my life from the Sea Troll Queen. That has to count for something...~|~translationMissing
Very well, I'll help. I'll need a cadava potion from the Varrock Apothecary, calibrated to suit my age. Also build me a proper mahogany coffin here - I wouldn't be seen dead in a cheap oak or teak one.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I'll try to get the potion and build you a coffin here.~|~translationMissing
I'll think about it.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) (Talk about something else)~|~translationMissing
I asked you to get me a cadava potion from the Varrock Apothecary, calibrated to suit my age, and to build me a mahogany coffin. How are you getting on?~|~translationMissing
I've not built the coffin yet.~|~translationMissing
So I see. Make sure it's mahogany when you do - I wouldn't be seen dead in a cheap oak or teak one. You can build it here.~|~translationMissing
I've not got the potion from the Apothecary yet.~|~translationMissing
Really? He's in Varrock, near the south-west corner of the city. He's a funny chap, but he knows his trade.~|~translationMissing
Talk about Making Friends with My Arm.~|~translationMissing
Do you remember the Cadava potion you made for Juliet? Can you make another one for the Wise Old Man? He said you'd need to calibrate the dosage to suit his age.~|~translationMissing
I suppose he'd need a smaller dose than Juliet did, yes. She's a healthy young woman in the prime of her life, while he's been around for decades.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm sure you remember the drill. I'll supply the wing of rat, tail of frog, ear of snake and horn of dog... and you need to bring me some Cadava berries.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have Cadava berries~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah, cadava berries. I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
If the player has Cadava berries already~|~translationMissing
Yup, I brought some of those.~|~translationMissing
That's very clever. I hope you've got a real feeling of pride and satisfaction from that.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the berries.~|~translationMissing
The Apothecary prepares the potion.~|~translationMissing
Well, I've built the coffin.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I should have told you to make a gilded one, with a marble pedestal and crystal ornamentation. It would look more fitting... but no, this will do.~|~translationMissing
I got the potion from the Apothecary.~|~translationMissing
Good. Hand it to me, then let us proceed with this charade.~|~translationMissing
You hand the potion to the Wise Old Man.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that looks about right. I wouldn't want to drink more than this, or I might risk an overdose. Well, here goes...~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man drinks the reduced cadava potion.~|~translationMissing
* BURP *~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man collapses...~|~translationMissing
... and you help him into his coffin.~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man has disguised himself as a corpse in a coffin to help you two.~|~translationMissing
He very obliging, dis mortal enemy of Weiss. Must have been big favour he owed [player name]. Okieday, give coffin to My Arm, an' My Arm give him to Mother.~|~translationMissing
Okieday, now My Arm has Wise Old Man in box! We go show Mother now. Maybe he like My Arm for killing big enemy of trolls.~|~translationMissing
You, My Arm, Snowflake, Odd Mushroom, and a "dead" Wise Old Man go see Mother.~|~translationMissing
Here, Mother, look what My Arm done! My Arm done killed your old enemy! He kick you out of Keldagrim long back, now My Arm got him dead in gift-box!~|~translationMissing
My Arm did this? My Arm killed him?~|~translationMissing
My Arm is clearly a great warrior, beyond the skills of any Weiss troll. We should welcome him into the tribe.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, let My Arm stay in Weiss please. Also, can My Arm marry your daughter?~|~translationMissing
Huh. Mother must think about that. But look at this body here...~|~translationMissing
What kind of fight was this? Where is the blood? When Mother kills an enemy, there is blood. Much blood. Blood, brains, gut juices.~|~translationMissing
This old man could have died of old age in his sleep. How is that revenge for what he did to Mother? And to Mother's people?~|~translationMissing
Come on, Mother. That man was our mortal enemy, and now My Arm's brought us his corpse. Accept My Arm as a friend and let's move on like civilised people.~|~translationMissing
You shut up, Odd Mushroom! Always talking about moving on, talking about civilising, talking about progress - what kind of troll are you?~|~translationMissing
You messed up Mother's daughter - she uses long words like you, talks about leading trolls into future.~|~translationMissing
She needs to marry proper troll, like Don't Know What, and remember how trolls are. Don't Know What can lead tribe for real.~|~translationMissing
Stop it, Father! You cannot tell me how to think, or how to live, or how to love. And I will be with My Arm.~|~translationMissing
I am Mother. I am your father, and you will obey me! This Arm troll brings nothing but trouble, and Mother does not trust him. In fact...~|~translationMissing
* snore *~|~translationMissing
Um... Don't worry, Mother, this is totally normal for a dead wizard. It's the magic escaping from the cadaver...~|~translationMissing
The unconscious Wise Old Man farts.~|~translationMissing
* parp *~|~translationMissing
I don't remember Juliet doing that!~|~translationMissing
A TRICK!~|~translationMissing
Mother attacks the group, and imprisons you all.~|~translationMissing
Those salt formations are really quite remarkable. Your troll friends are having a private moment, so I'll study these while my head recovers from that potion.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake, are you there? Reason tells me there is light in here, but my mind sees darkness.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake?~|~translationMissing
I am here. Father did not hurt me much. Can you stand, Odd Mushroom?~|~translationMissing
... no, I don't think so. I am glad you are here with me, Snowflake. I must tell you something...~|~translationMissing
I can smell that Mother has lit a Fire of Domination, up above. He never cared for most of my inventions, but he liked that one.~|~translationMissing
That's the one that traps his enemies, and helps him beat them to a pulp. Definitely his favourite. He must intend to kill you all.~|~translationMissing
Fire of Domination?~|~translationMissing
... I suppose I have no secrets, now, even from the age- old enemy of Weiss. But you and I are thinkers, and in other circumstances we might have been friends.~|~translationMissing
These salts in the mine - I invented ways to combine them, unlock their power. In a fire, they can work wonders.~|~translationMissing
The Fire of Domination will block teleportation magicks, and it also aids Mother in a fight. It makes him incredibly dangerous.~|~translationMissing
So we can't teleport out of here?~|~translationMissing
That hole leads down to the sea. But it's far too narrow for a troll to get through.~|~translationMissing
My Arm not want to enter smelly hole!~|~translationMissing
I don't think I could get in there either, even if the smell weren't abhorrent. But [player name] might be able to fit.~|~translationMissing
I'll never leave you.~|~translationMissing
You good friend, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Anyway, Odd Mushroom was telling us about the fires he'd invented.~|~translationMissing
I wrote down my inventions, but many of my notes are lost. Mother only ever cared about the Fire of Domination, and fires he could use for combat.~|~translationMissing
It can be hard to interest trolls in the delicate skill of Firemaking, sometimes. But perhaps Snowflake can find my lost notes, and carry on the science. She's far smarter than her father.~|~translationMissing
But I never invented a fire that could stave off the eternal dark, and... I feel it coming.~|~translationMissing
Snowflake, you must take over Weiss. You saw what Mother did to you, and to me, and to My Arm. Trolls will never be more than thuggish monsters as long as he rules.~|~translationMissing
Mother did hit My Arm pretty hard.~|~translationMissing
I know what I must do. With My Arm at my side, I will avenge you. You were always more of a father to me than Mother ever could be.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, child...~|~translationMissing
That'll be handy if I feel like escaping.~|~translationMissing
Aww.~|~translationMissing
My Arm, [player name], Old Man, we are going to get out of here, and punish my father for what he has done.~|~translationMissing
You have my support.~|~translationMissing
And My Arm.~|~translationMissing
I hate to be indelicate, but... it may not be possible to overthrow Mother without killing him, especially if the fire makes him as dangerous as Odd Mushroom said.~|~translationMissing
Father killed Odd Mushroom. Odd Mushroom was like a father to me. Mother must pay the price. Also I think he really will kill us all.~|~translationMissing
[player name], you heard Odd Mushroom's warning. We can't use our teleport magicks, so the only escape - for you - is down the smelly hole.~|~translationMissing
Also, if we drop anything in here, I bet you're not going to be able to retrieve it. Items dropped in here will be lost forever.~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man is telling you that teleports are blocked, and there will be no way to retrieve your items if you die in here.~|~translationMissing
So I can't teleport, and I may lose stuff? Okay.~|~translationMissing
[player name] is brave human an' good friend for My Arm and Snowflake!~|~translationMissing
Old Man, do your magic and open that door!~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man casts a spell and busts the prison gate open.~|~translationMissing
Aargh - they're out!~|~translationMissing
I'm not ready to fight yet.~|~translationMissing
Okieday, we hang around here until you are.~|~translationMissing
... so you two kill the stupid Arm troll and the human it brought with it. Mother will sort Snowflake out permanently.~|~translationMissing
Odd Stone~|~translationMissing
Mother cannot mean to kill Snowflake, surely?~|~translationMissing
You want to do it yourself?~|~translationMissing
Um... that was not what I meant.~|~translationMissing
Question Mother again, and it will be your blood that Mother drinks instead. Snowflake betrayed her father, and Mother does not forgive.~|~translationMissing
Butterfly~|~translationMissing
We are not happy about this.~|~translationMissing
Mother does not need you to be happy. Mother requires only that you obey, or die. We are trolls, not softy liberals like Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
OLD MAN IN THE DUNGEON!~|~translationMissing
OLD MAN IN THE DUNGEON! Thought you ought to know.~|~translationMissing
Of course he is in the dungeon. Mother put him there.~|~translationMissing
No, I mean he got out.~|~translationMissing
We got him!~|~translationMissing
My Arm sorry 'bout your dad, Snowflake. But he kinda gonna kill us, anyway.~|~translationMissing
I am sorry too. Father was flawed, but he did much for our people, and he should have retired with honour long ago.~|~translationMissing
Old Man, [player name], thank you both for your help.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure this was my proudest adventure, but you're welcome. I think I'll head off home to Draynor quite soon.~|~translationMissing
Very well. You will always be welcome here. Now, that is enough of the past. I feel the future beginning in Weiss... Let us summon my tribe.~|~translationMissing
Snowflakes summons the entire village to her.~|~translationMissing
Trolls of Weiss, I am Snowflake, daughter of Mother, my father. Mother is dead, and I claim the throne.~|~translationMissing
Yup, My Arm helped Snowflake kill him.~|~translationMissing
Let's not emphasise that bit now, eh?~|~translationMissing
Does any troll here challenge me?~|~translationMissing
Nope, we like Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
Goat Poo~|~translationMissing
Snowflake nicer than Mother. We okay with Snowflake.~|~translationMissing
Then the throne of Weiss is mine. I also call you to witness our marriage. [player name], please step forward.~|~translationMissing
The player steps forward.~|~translationMissing
I, Snowflake, give myself to My Arm. I take My Arm as my support and comforter. I will hold My Arm by my side for life.~|~translationMissing
My Arm is my friend forever. I will share the sorrows of life with My Arm, and I will share the joys of love with My Arm.~|~translationMissing
My Arm will support Snowflake. My Arm will be at Snowflake's side. My Arm takes Snowflake by the hand for life.~|~translationMissing
My Arm will be Snowflake's companion when sun shines an' life is bright. My Arm will be Snowflake's comfort in dark places.~|~translationMissing
I pronounce you husband and wife!~|~translationMissing
Congratulations!~|~translationMissing
We now perform the ancient dance of love...~|~translationMissing
Snowflake and My Arm perform the ancient dance of love, while the player and the Wise Old Man dance together.~|~translationMissing
Well, that was jolly charming, but I'm off now. Good bye.~|~translationMissing
Sure would have been easier gettin' up to dis place if My Arm could do tellypot like dat!~|~translationMissing
[player name], we owe you so much, and we will thank you - but we still need one small favour first.~|~translationMissing
You need... one small favour...? I've heard that said before.~|~translationMissing
Yup, you good at dis stuff. My Arm been telling Snowflake how you fetched all kinda stuff to Stronghold for My Arm before.~|~translationMissing
... yes, as an experienced adventurer, I have indeed fetched stuff for people.~|~translationMissing
Good. Now please fetch us some goat dung. You should find some in the goat pen outside. Meanwhile I need to assign some of my trolls to different duties around Weiss.~|~translationMissing
What do you want with goat dung?~|~translationMissing
I think it will be useful to us. You will see why soon enough.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
This is the kind of thing that's best carried in buckets.~|~translationMissing
Have you got the goat dung?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have any goat dung~|~translationMissing
No, I've not got any goat dung yet.~|~translationMissing
You should find some in the goat pen outside. Meanwhile I need to assign some of my trolls to different duties around Weiss.~|~translationMissing
If the player has goat dung~|~translationMissing
You proudly display your bucket of poo.~|~translationMissing
My Arm, what do you think, dear?~|~translationMissing
My Arm t'inks dis gonna work, yeah!~|~translationMissing
Good! My Arm said you needed camel dung to grow goutweed. But goat dung is similar enough - I will make my trolls build farming patches from goat dung instead.~|~translationMissing
She got trolls to use goat poo to make two herb patches! One for us to grow goutweed, an' one for you, 'cos you been good friend. We protect your stuff from disease.~|~translationMissing
I have searched through Odd Mushroom's possessions. Sadly much of his research has been lost. I have copied what I could find into a book for you.~|~translationMissing
He would have wanted you to have it - some of his inventions are not useful here, but you are a traveller and may find places to use them.~|~translationMissing
You give it looksie now, an' see if you learn good stuff! Go on, Snowflake work hard on dis for you!~|~translationMissing
Snowflake gives you a tatty book of Odd Mushroom's writings.~|~translationMissing
You read book from Snowflake yet? She work hard on it for you.~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I've got it here.~|~translationMissing
I read that book you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Good! Now you know all Odd Mushroom's fire learnings, an' maybe they be useful to you.~|~translationMissing
When we have finished here, I would like you to try the Fire of Nourishment. Although Boulder made two herb patches as we told him, crops will not grow without such a fire to strengthen them.~|~translationMissing
Herbie patches are outside Weiss, through gap in fence, west of town. One patch is for you, an' Boulder gonna protect it from disease for you.~|~translationMissing
I'll bear it in mind. Through the gap in the fence, to the west of the town, you say?~|~translationMissing
That is right, [player name]. You can mine the salts in the cave below, next to the prison.~|~translationMissing
Now, let us thank you for bringing us together, for saving our lives and for marrying us...~|~translationMissing

Abigale~|~translationMissing
Start the Misthalin Mystery quest?~|~translationMissing
What has happened here?~|~translationMissing
We were invited to a house party on an island not far from here... Something felt wrong about the whole thing but we went anyway...~|~translationMissing
The house seemed pretty creepy, but everything was going fine, we were all having a good time...~|~translationMissing
...and that's when we got attacked...~|~translationMissing
Hewey~|~translationMissing
I... I tried to save her...~|~translationMissing
Hewey bought me enough time to find an old boat. I went back to get him but it was too late. I'm scared that he won't make it.~|~translationMissing
You have to do something... they can't get away with this!~|~translationMissing
What do you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
That psycho is still out there, you have to bring them to justice.~|~translationMissing
The boat we escaped on is just over there, you can use it to get to the island.~|~translationMissing
I'm not getting involved in this!~|~translationMissing
Please, you need to make sure they don't get away with this! You can use the boat over there to get to the island we escaped from.~|~translationMissing
You row through the fog to the nearby island.~|~translationMissing
You row through the fog back to Lumbridge Swamp.~|~translationMissing
You need space in your inventory to take the bucket.~|~translationMissing
If the player has space but already has a bucket~|~translationMissing
You already have a bucket.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the manor key~|~translationMissing
I'll have to find the key...~|~translationMissing
If the player has the manor key~|~translationMissing
You use the manor key to unlock the door.~|~translationMissing
Sid~|~translationMissing
Woo, party on bro!~|~translationMissing
The killer approaches Sid behind his back.~|~translationMissing
Woah, that wind totally just felt like someone breathing on my neck!~|~translationMissing
The killer stabs Sid.~|~translationMissing
Whoah, not cool bro...~|~translationMissing
...urgh...~|~translationMissing
...I'm feeling woozy...~|~translationMissing
...gargh...~|~translationMissing
...I see the light...~|~translationMissing
...urrggghhh...~|~translationMissing
...it's not my time...glurgh~|~translationMissing
...gargle...urgh...~|~translationMissing
Killer~|~translationMissing
Sid stumbles forward, drowning in the water barrel.~|~translationMissing
...glargh...help...me...~|~translationMissing
...urgh...hergle...~|~translationMissing
...flergh.~|~translationMissing
Sid collapses to the ground in a crumpled mess. As he falls down you spot something shiny fall out of his shirt pocket and into the barrel of water.~|~translationMissing
Gosh, that was horrible and so drawn out!~|~translationMissing
Oh wow, he's still going...~|~translationMissing
I think he is actually dead this time.~|~translationMissing
Who are you? Why are you doing this!?~|~translationMissing
The killer walks away.~|~translationMissing
Gah! I've got to find a way into that house and stop this maniac!~|~translationMissing
I wonder what it was that I saw fall into that barrel?~|~translationMissing
The barrel is full of rainwater, I can't see what's in there.~|~translationMissing
You fill the bucket from the barrel.~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough space in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
You find a key at the bottom of the barrel.~|~translationMissing
The killer appears from a closet, stabbing Tayten, who is reading a book.~|~translationMissing
Tayten~|~translationMissing
Gurgle...~|~translationMissing
Nooooo!~|~translationMissing
The killer slips a note under the door, and escapes using the closet.~|~translationMissing
What's this? A note? I guess I should read it.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the note~|~translationMissing
You have already taken a copy of the note.~|~translationMissing
You need space in your inventory to take the note.~|~translationMissing
You take a copy of the note.~|~translationMissing
You need space in your inventory to take the knife.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a knife~|~translationMissing
You already have a knife.~|~translationMissing
You take the knife from the table.~|~translationMissing
Those stairs don't look so safe...~|~translationMissing
Nope, nothing here...~|~translationMissing
You slash open the painting, revealing a hidden storage compartment.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the ruby key~|~translationMissing
You have already found the ruby key.~|~translationMissing
You find a key hidden inside the slashed painting.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the necessary key~|~translationMissing
If the player has the necessary key~|~translationMissing
You use the [ruby/emerald/sapphire] key to unlock the door.~|~translationMissing
The key doesn't fit.~|~translationMissing
You need space in your inventory to take a tinderbox.~|~translationMissing
You already have a tinderbox.~|~translationMissing
You take a tinderbox from the shelves.~|~translationMissing
The fuse is too damp to light...~|~translationMissing
You light the candle.~|~translationMissing
You light the candle. The room is sufficiently warmed, the fuse should now have dried out.~|~translationMissing
You attempt to light the fuse...~|~translationMissing
The fuse is lit, I should get out of here before it blows!~|~translationMissing
Lacey~|~translationMissing
Please, stop this, just let me go!~|~translationMissing
We're going to play a game. Do you like to play games?~|~translationMissing
No...yes....whatever you say, just don't hurt me!~|~translationMissing
Whether you get hurt or not is entirely up to you. Your fate is in your own hands.~|~translationMissing
What!? What do you mean!?~|~translationMissing
Leave her alone you monster!~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name], how kind of you to join us. Now if you say another word, I will end her right now!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, where were we? Ah yes, of course! The game!~|~translationMissing
Do you like quests, Lacey?~|~translationMissing
Ummm, sure, I like quests.~|~translationMissing
Do you like scary quests?~|~translationMissing
Uh-huh.~|~translationMissing
What's your favourite scary quest?~|~translationMissing
You have to have a favourite.~|~translationMissing
Umm.....the one with that vampyre in it who lives in a big house.~|~translationMissing
Good, good. And now for that game I spoke about.~|~translationMissing
I am going to ask you one question. Get it wrong and you die, but get it right and you live.~|~translationMissing
Oh Guthix please no, please don't, I don't want to die!~|~translationMissing
Then think hard about your answer. You like vampyres so this should be easy for you. The question is this...~|~translationMissing
Who is the Vampyre that resides in South Misthalin?~|~translationMissing
Urm...~|~translationMissing
Interrupt with answer?~|~translationMissing
Count Draynor~|~translationMissing
Count Draynor!~|~translationMissing
Count Check~|~translationMissing
Count Check!~|~translationMissing
Lord Drakan~|~translationMissing
Lord Drakan!~|~translationMissing
This game didn't involve you [player name]! Now her death is on you! Her blood is on your hands you fool!~|~translationMissing
The killer stabs Lacey.~|~translationMissing
Gargle...urgh...~|~translationMissing
Say nothing~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, yes, I know it! Count Draynor!~|~translationMissing
Ha, in your face you masked freak!~|~translationMissing
Oh Lacey, Lacey, Lacey. I did tell you to think hard about your answer.~|~translationMissing
Count Draynor is in fact a vampyre, and he does reside in his manor in Misthalin.~|~translationMissing
But that manor is in WEST Misthalin! I was talking about Count Check! Thanks for playing!~|~translationMissing
No, no you tricked me! This isn't fair, ask me another...~|~translationMissing
Lacey dies.~|~translationMissing
The killer slips a note through the fence, and walks away.~|~translationMissing
That monster! I have to stop them! Let's see what that new note says.~|~translationMissing
There doesn't seem to be anything to observe past the trees.~|~translationMissing
Before getting the note~|~translationMissing
There is no time to be playing around!~|~translationMissing
Before reading the note~|~translationMissing
I don't think that's right... Perhaps the clue the killer left behind could help?~|~translationMissing
You play [a/an] [A-G].~|~translationMissing
There is a clicking sound as the compartment on the piano unlocks.~|~translationMissing
If the player already found the key~|~translationMissing
You have already found the emerald key.~|~translationMissing
You find a key hidden inside the piano's compartment.~|~translationMissing
Mandy~|~translationMissing
Why am I the one who is always left clearing up after everyone?~|~translationMissing
*shuffle*~|~translationMissing
Hello? Anyone there?~|~translationMissing
*rustle*~|~translationMissing
Hello? Lacey? Sid?~|~translationMissing
*scratch*~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well I guess I should go check it out. No point staying in this nice, locked room when I could go outside into the creepy darkness.~|~translationMissing
Seriously!?~|~translationMissing
The walls and door seem too thick for Mandy to be able to hear you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and I don't think there is any need to take this big, shiny weapon with me in order to defend myself. Nothing bad ever happens when people go check out noises in the dark outside of houses!~|~translationMissing
You have got to be kidding...~|~translationMissing
Ok, well, here I go!~|~translationMissing
Mandy goes outside to investigate the noises.~|~translationMissing
Hello, anyone out here?~|~translationMissing
Mandy looks around.~|~translationMissing
See, I knew nothing would happen! Must have just been a squirrel or something running about.~|~translationMissing
Mandy goes back into the kitchen.~|~translationMissing
Oh well, back to the dishes.~|~translationMissing
Phew, that was lucky!~|~translationMissing
The killer comes out of the closet near the exit and stabs Mandy.~|~translationMissing
No...why...me...~|~translationMissing
Mandy dies.~|~translationMissing
That psycho! He was just toying with her!~|~translationMissing
Another note. This guy really likes playing games, but this is going to be a game he won't win!~|~translationMissing
You use your knife to pry open a loose brick in the fireplace, revealing a secret panel.~|~translationMissing
You find a panel of switches inside the hidden compartment. Each switch is crafted from a different gemstone.~|~translationMissing
You flip the [gemstone] switch.~|~translationMissing
If the code was incorrect~|~translationMissing
I don't think that's the right order.. Perhaps the clue the killer left behind could help?~|~translationMissing
If the code was correct~|~translationMissing
There is a clicking sound as the compartment in the fireplace unlocks.~|~translationMissing
You have already found the sapphire key.~|~translationMissing
You find a key hidden inside the fireplace.~|~translationMissing
Show yourself you coward!~|~translationMissing
So we meet at last. I have to say, I'm impressed you worked out my riddles.~|~translationMissing
Well maybe you aren't as smart as you think you are.~|~translationMissing
Oh really? All the dead bodies suggest otherwise. And what did you do to stop them?~|~translationMissing
NOTHING!~|~translationMissing
People think you are some big hero but you're not. All you adventurers are the same. Nothing but opportunists!~|~translationMissing
What are you going on about?~|~translationMissing
Well, I did have this big speech planned out but quite frankly I don't think you are worth the effort it would take to deliver it.~|~translationMissing
So, this is the end of the line for you. It is time for the final act. The showdown. The finale. Let's see if you are up to the challenge!~|~translationMissing
*ouch*~|~translationMissing
Urgh...I think I may have underestimated you.~|~translationMissing
You've lost at your own game. And now it is time to see who you really are under that mask!~|~translationMissing
The player unmasks the killer, revealing Abigale as the culprit.~|~translationMissing
No! You!? But why!? Why on earth would you kill all your friends!? Why beg me to come here to help them!?~|~translationMissing
You just don't get it do you?~|~translationMissing
So big headed. So used to it all being about you. About you saving the day.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm sick of it!~|~translationMissing
Adventurers! You're all the same. Everything always has to be about you.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand?~|~translationMissing
Of course you wouldn't! Because you can't see past yourself!~|~translationMissing
Believe it or not... I used to be like you.~|~translationMissing
I'd hear about some damsel in distress and go to help. To have my moment. For me to be the hero, just for once.~|~translationMissing
But YOU! You and every other darned adventurer! Every time I get there to help, it's too late. Crisis solved. Disaster averted. Reward claimed. Every time you and those other adventurers steal my moment!~|~translationMissing
But not this time!~|~translationMissing
This time, it is all about me! I'm the star of the show! ME ME ME ME ME!~|~translationMissing
Well not any longer. The show is over, and there will be no curtain call.~|~translationMissing
Oh, but there is always a curtain call.~|~translationMissing
Another killer comes out of the closest near the door.~|~translationMissing
What!? How!? There was another killer!?~|~translationMissing
Of course. Every good show needs a good supporting actor. Now, take off your mask darling. Take a bow. You have earned it.~|~translationMissing
Of course, my love.~|~translationMissing
The killer unmasks himself, revealing Hewey as the culprit.~|~translationMissing
You!? But how!? You were almost dead when I saw you! I saw your wounds!~|~translationMissing
No, what you watched was what we wanted you to watch. A masterful performance if I do say myself.~|~translationMissing
But what is in this for you?~|~translationMissing
Everyone loves the limelight, and who better to share it with than my beloved Abigale.~|~translationMissing
But your friends?~|~translationMissing
They didn't deserve to die!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps not, but neither did I deserve to be cast back into the shadows when I deserve the spotlight!~|~translationMissing
Yes, while we deserve the spotlight.~|~translationMissing
And now I have my starring role!~|~translationMissing
OUR starring role.~|~translationMissing
Gielinor will forever remember this night and what I have done here.~|~translationMissing
No, what WE have done!~|~translationMissing
Quiet Hewey! This is my moment!~|~translationMissing
No, this is supposed to be our moment! It isn't just all about you either! We were in this together!~|~translationMissing
Stop ruining this Hewey! I have worked so hard for this and I'm not going to let you take it away from me!~|~translationMissing
Well I'm not going to be pushed aside either, we were both in this as equals!~|~translationMissing
We were never equals! How could you possibly compare to me!?~|~translationMissing
You egotistical, selfish...~|~translationMissing
Abigale stabs Hewey.~|~translationMissing
No...my love...~|~translationMissing
Hewey dies.~|~translationMissing
No....no...what have I done!?~|~translationMissing
It wasn't supposed to be like this...but you just couldn't let me have my moment. WHY HEWEY WHY!? I loved you...~|~translationMissing
This could be my chance to take advantage of the situation...~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough inventory space to hold that item.~|~translationMissing
I don't think he's in a very talkative mood.~|~translationMissing
I'm not going at her empty-handed!~|~translationMissing
It would be wiser to use the killer's knife rather than my own weapon...~|~translationMissing
The player stabs Abigale.~|~translationMissing
Well thank Saradomin that's over! I should get out of here.~|~translationMissing
I don't think she wants to talk to me right now.~|~translationMissing
You'll never escape me!~|~translationMissing
In the background, Mandy gets up.~|~translationMissing
You dare try and ruin my moment!~|~translationMissing
Mandy walks toward the Bandos godsword on the table.~|~translationMissing
Hewey is dead because of you!~|~translationMissing
Mandy picks up the Bandos godsword and enters the closet.~|~translationMissing
Now it is time for you to join him!~|~translationMissing
Mandy comes out of the closet behind Mandy.~|~translationMissing
You're not killing anyone else!~|~translationMissing
Mandy uses the sword's special attack on Abigale.~|~translationMissing
No....this can't be it....~|~translationMissing
Abigale dies.~|~translationMissing
Wow, that was close!~|~translationMissing
Mandy, how are you alive!? I watched you get stabbed through the heart!~|~translationMissing
I did get stabbed, but I was born with a rare condition called Dextrocardia.~|~translationMissing
Dextrowhat?~|~translationMissing
Dextrocardia. It means that my heart is on the right side of my chest, not the left like most people.~|~translationMissing
So when the killer thought they stabbed you in the heart, they actually missed?~|~translationMissing
Well, missed the heart yes.~|~translationMissing
I did still get stabbed though, and am actually feeling pretty woozy...~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes, right! You should go sort yourself out!~|~translationMissing
I will wait outside the house after seeing to this stab wound. You should come talk to me there.~|~translationMissing
You decide it's wise to leave the murder weapon behind.~|~translationMissing
Oh hi, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Hi Mandy. How are you feeling now?~|~translationMissing
Much better thanks, and lucky to be alive, thanks to you in no small part.~|~translationMissing
Well we saved the day as a team, so thank you too.~|~translationMissing
If the player has insufficient inventory space~|~translationMissing
I found some stuff in the wardrobe when I was seeing to my wound. You need [3 more spaces/2 more spaces/another space] in your inventory to take it all.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least three inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
Here, I found these in the wardrobe when I was seeing to my wound. I don't want them so please, take them...~|~translationMissing
Thanks again for your help, [player name]. Stay safe.~|~translationMissing
You too, Mandy.~|~translationMissing

Hello there, What's wrong?~|~translationMissing
Brother Omad~|~translationMissing
*yawn*...oh, hello...*yawn* I'm sorry! I'm just so tired! I haven't slept in a week!~|~translationMissing
Why can't you sleep, what's wrong?~|~translationMissing
It's brother Androe's son! With his constant~|~translationMissing
Waaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaah! Androe said it's natural, but it's so annoying!~|~translationMissing
I suppose that's what kids do.~|~translationMissing
He was fine, up until last week! Thieves broke in! They stole his favourite sleeping blanket!~|~translationMissing
Now he won't rest until it's returned... ...and that means neither can I!~|~translationMissing
Start the Monk's Friend quest?~|~translationMissing
Can I help at all?~|~translationMissing
Please do. We won't be able to help you as we are peaceful men but we would be grateful for your help!~|~translationMissing
Where are they?~|~translationMissing
They hide in a secret cave in the forest. It's hidden under a ring of stones. Please, bring back the blanket!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to hear that! I hope you find his blanket.~|~translationMissing
Sorry! I'm too busy to hear your problems!~|~translationMissing
*yawn*...oh, hello again...*yawn*~|~translationMissing
Please tell me you have the blanket.~|~translationMissing
I need some sleep!~|~translationMissing
*yawn*~|~translationMissing
A ladder mysteriously appears.~|~translationMissing
Yes! I've recovered it from the clutches of the evil thieves!~|~translationMissing
You hand the monk the childs blanket.~|~translationMissing
Really, that's excellent, well done! Maybe now I will be able to get some rest.~|~translationMissing
*yawn*..I'm off to bed! Farewell brave traveller!~|~translationMissing
Can't wait for the party!~|~translationMissing
Brother Cedric~|~translationMissing
Honey, money, woman and wine!~|~translationMissing
Yesshh...hic up...beautiful!~|~translationMissing
Take care old monk.~|~translationMissing
La..di..da..hic..up!~|~translationMissing
The old monk has had too much to drink.~|~translationMissing
Hello, how are you?~|~translationMissing
Much better now I'm sleeping well! Now I can organise the party.~|~translationMissing
Ooh! What party?~|~translationMissing
The son of Brother Androe's birthday party. He's going to be one year old!~|~translationMissing
That's sweet!~|~translationMissing
It's also a great excuse for a drink!~|~translationMissing
We just need Brother Cedric to return with the wine.~|~translationMissing
Who's Brother Cedric?~|~translationMissing
Cedric is a member of the order too. We sent him out three days ago to collect wine. But he didn't return!~|~translationMissing
He most probably got drunk and lost in the forest!~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you could look for him?~|~translationMissing
I've no time for that, sorry.~|~translationMissing
Okay traveller, take care.~|~translationMissing
Where should I look?~|~translationMissing
Oh, he won't be far. Probably out in the forest.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go and find him.~|~translationMissing
Can I come to the party?~|~translationMissing
Of course, but we need the wine first.~|~translationMissing
Enjoy it! I'll see you soon!~|~translationMissing
Take care traveller.~|~translationMissing
Hello brother Omad.~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer, have you found Brother Cedric?~|~translationMissing
Well, keep looking, we need that wine!~|~translationMissing
Brother Cedric are you okay?~|~translationMissing
Yeesshhh, I'm very, very drunk..hic..up..~|~translationMissing
Brother Omad needs the wine for the party.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, oh dear, I knew I had to do something!~|~translationMissing
Pleashhh, find me a jug of water. Once I'm sober I'll 'elp you take the wine back.~|~translationMissing
Hic up! Oh my head! I need a jug of water.~|~translationMissing
I'll see if I can get some.~|~translationMissing
Thanks! *hic*~|~translationMissing
Yes I've seen him, he's a bit drunk!~|~translationMissing
Well, try your best to get him back here!~|~translationMissing
Cedric! Here, drink! I have some water.~|~translationMissing
Good stuff, my head's spinning!~|~translationMissing
You hand the monk a jug of water.~|~translationMissing
Gulp... gulp!~|~translationMissing
Aah! That's better!~|~translationMissing
Now I just need to fix this cart and we can go party.~|~translationMissing
Could you help?~|~translationMissing
No, I've helped enough monks today!~|~translationMissing
In that case I'd better drink more wine! It helps me think.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd be happy to!~|~translationMissing
Excellent, I just need some wood. Some plain logs, or maybe a basic plank.~|~translationMissing
OK, I'll see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
Hello again brother Omad.~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer, where's Brother Cedric?~|~translationMissing
He's having a bit of trouble with his cart.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm! Maybe you could help?~|~translationMissing
Did you manage to get some wood?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
You show Cedric some logs.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a plank~|~translationMissing
You show Cedric a wooden plank.~|~translationMissing
Here you go!~|~translationMissing
Well done! Now I'll fix this cart. You head back to Brother Omad and tell him I'll be there soon.~|~translationMissing
Ok! I'll see you later!~|~translationMissing
Hello Cedric.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I'm almost done here. Could you tell Omad that I'll be back soon?~|~translationMissing
Hi Omad, Brother Cedric is on his way!~|~translationMissing
Good! Good! Now we can party!~|~translationMissing
I have little to repay you with but please, take these runes.~|~translationMissing
Brother Omad gives you 8 Law Runes.~|~translationMissing

5.4 Reporting back to King Narnode~|~translationMissing
Hello there, King Narnode.~|~translationMissing
Good of you to stop by, human.~|~translationMissing
How fares the kingdom today?~|~translationMissing
Everything seems fine, as far as I can tell... I will let you know if there is any trouble.~|~translationMissing
All is not well, [player name]. Despite having had Glough under close surveillance since the events on Ape Atoll, he has managed to escape the Stronghold.~|~translationMissing
I know you have already done so much for our kingdom, but could you look into Glough's disappearance?~|~translationMissing
I'll help you look for Glough.~|~translationMissing
Any idea on where to start?~|~translationMissing
You should look anywhere Glough may have left behind clues of his whereabouts. I've already had my men search his home, but perhaps you can find something they missed.~|~translationMissing
I'll get right to it.~|~translationMissing
I'm busy at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps some other time, then.~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
What should I be looking for again?~|~translationMissing
I wonder who could have left this in Glough's home? The initials A.A. are embroidered into it.~|~translationMissing
Is this your handkerchief?~|~translationMissing
Why, yes, it is. I must have left it behind somewhere...~|~translationMissing
You return Anita's handkerchief - she looks as if she could use it.~|~translationMissing
Hi Anita.~|~translationMissing
*sob* W-what do you want? *sob*~|~translationMissing
*sob* It's Glough... I fear for the worst!~|~translationMissing
I think he might be seeing someone else! *sob* I hadn't heard from him in a while, and so decided to give him a visit.~|~translationMissing
At first, I thought there was nobody home... *sob* But then I heard... *sob*~|~translationMissing
Heard what?~|~translationMissing
I've already said too much. *sob* The last time I helped you, Glough lost his job!~|~translationMissing
What do you care? He's seeing someone else!~|~translationMissing
He might be in trouble, I could help.~|~translationMissing
I heard whispering coming from higher up in his tree! I managed to climb the first branch... *sob* But I'm not agile enough to get up to the highest level...~|~translationMissing
Do you really think he might have gotten into trouble? *sob*~|~translationMissing
There's another level to his home?~|~translationMissing
*sob* There's nowhere else the voices could have been coming from... *sob* Please, climb up there and let me know what you find!~|~translationMissing
Any idea where Glough is?~|~translationMissing
The last time I helped you... *sob* Glough lost his job!~|~translationMissing
Nothing, goodbye.~|~translationMissing
The fire has been recently extinguished, you find a half burned note in the ashes.~|~translationMissing
The note is blank... I'm not sure what I'm meant to be reading right now.~|~translationMissing
The rest of the note has been destroyed by the fire.~|~translationMissing
I need to translate this before it's going to be of any use... Maybe the King can help.~|~translationMissing
What could the note mean? I should show it to the King, he might be able to make some sense of it.~|~translationMissing
I found a note in Glough's home which might be of use.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, do you have it with you?~|~translationMissing
I have it right here.~|~translationMissing
You show the note to King Narnode.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see that it is written in the ancient gnome language... Perhaps you could translate it with that translation book you've used before?~|~translationMissing
If thee player doesn't have a translation book~|~translationMissing
I don't have a copy of the translation book any more.~|~translationMissing
Here's a spare copy.~|~translationMissing
King Narnode hands you a replacement copy of the translation book.~|~translationMissing
I'll give it a go.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a translation book~|~translationMissing
Some of the ancient Gnome phrases found on the note are missing from the translation book. I should tell the King.~|~translationMissing
There's too much missing from this translation book to make much sense of the note.~|~translationMissing
It is true that the translation guide is incomplete... Perhaps it would be of more use to go to the author directly?~|~translationMissing
I'll see if the author can help translate the note for me, then.~|~translationMissing
Could you translate these notes?~|~translationMissing
Could you translate these notes? I found them in Glough's home, half of it is missing.~|~translationMissing
You show Anita the notes you found.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... This certainly isn't Glough's handwriting...~|~translationMissing
Anita takes a moment to translate the notes.~|~translationMissing
Anita hands you a translation of the notes.~|~translationMissing
Here you go, hopefully it helps you find Glough.~|~translationMissing
King Narnode! With Anita's help I was able to translate the note... It appears Glough had help leaving the stronghold!~|~translationMissing
What!? Who could have committed such a crime? Show me the note.~|~translationMissing
King Narnode reads the translated note.~|~translationMissing
The note refers to a replacement pilot, we've only had one pilot reassigned recently and that's Lori taking over Le Smith's post as a balloon pilot.~|~translationMissing
[player name], you must find out where Glough might have travelled to. Assistant Lori may be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Have you been able to find out where Glough has gone, [player name]~|~translationMissing
Not yet, King Narnode.~|~translationMissing
Please hurry, [player name]. Glough is very dangerous and must be stopped!~|~translationMissing
Assistant Lori~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No.~|~translationMissing
I am Assistant Lori. I've been assigned to the stronghold by Auguste.~|~translationMissing
What happened to Assistant Le Smith?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure, you would have to speak to Auguste about that.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to use the balloon?~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name]. It is good to see you again. My enterprise has grown since we last met. I've expanded all over Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
If you'd like to go to a new location, you will have to help fly the balloon again. Some of the routes are very dangerous!~|~translationMissing
But each route you complete will earn you Firemaking experience.~|~translationMissing
Once you've opened a route, it only costs 1 log of the corresponding type to travel there again, from any location you've already opened!~|~translationMissing
I have also hired assistants to watch over the balloons at each new location we go to. They will help you get where you want to go.~|~translationMissing
Talk about Assistant Le Smith.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to talk about Assistant Le Smith.~|~translationMissing
What a coincidence, he just so happened to visit recently. What's this about?~|~translationMissing
I need to know about the route you taught him.~|~translationMissing
Ah... I insisted it was far too dangerous, nobody has attempted to make that journey before!~|~translationMissing
Ape Atoll...~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the information.~|~translationMissing
Can you teach me the route?~|~translationMissing
Most certainly not! For all I know, I've already sent one of my finest pilots to his peril!~|~translationMissing
I've found evidence that Glough may have headed to Ape Atoll.~|~translationMissing
How could this be?~|~translationMissing
Assistant Le Smith is involved, it appears he has flown them there.~|~translationMissing
Agh! We were foolish to allow him to stay here after dismissing him from the glider regiment.~|~translationMissing
So, what should we do now?~|~translationMissing
Glough must be working with the monkeys once again. Fortunately, the rest of the 10th squad remained on Ape Atoll after your previous mission, they have been keeping a close eye on Awowogei.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps they will have spotted something out of the ordinary that could help indicate what Glough is doing.~|~translationMissing
Glough is a threat to us all... I must hereby re-assign you to Ape Atoll, [player name]. Report to Sergeant Garkor on Ape Atoll for further orders.~|~translationMissing
I have given you orders, [player name]. Report to Sergeant Garkor on Ape Atoll for further instruction.~|~translationMissing
Garkor~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, [player name].~|~translationMissing
King Narnode has sent me.~|~translationMissing
King Narnode has sent me. I'm investigating the disappearance of Glough.~|~translationMissing
Glough... really? We've not had any indication that he has returned to Ape Atoll.~|~translationMissing
But we have been seeing a lot of activity from Awowogei and his commanders - I assumed the king would send someone soon enough.~|~translationMissing
Any idea what they're up to?~|~translationMissing
We're not entirely sure, he has been keeping a tight lid on his plans. I guess it could be tied to Glough's disappearance? Perhaps you could get more information from Awowogei directly...~|~translationMissing
He may be willing to share his plans with you, assuming you are disguised with a greegree, that is.~|~translationMissing
That sounds far too dangerous.~|~translationMissing
A member of the 10th squad should never back down in the face of adversity, come back when you're feeling up to the task.~|~translationMissing
What are you still doing here?~|~translationMissing
My squad and I are still carrying out reconnaissance. Awowogei has been very occupied as of lately, could this have something to do with why you're here?~|~translationMissing
I'm only passing through.~|~translationMissing
Have you learned anything from Awowogei yet?~|~translationMissing
We can't give up, [player name], come back when you've got more information.~|~translationMissing
I'll get to it right away.~|~translationMissing
Awowogei~|~translationMissing
What do you want? I'm very busy right now.~|~translationMissing
How are things going, Awowogei?~|~translationMissing
I don't have time for idle chat! What do you want?~|~translationMissing
I'm here to discuss military strategies.~|~translationMissing
I only discuss such matters with my highest ranking military officials. In fact, I am supposed to be in a meeting with my commander right now. Kruk has been consistently late to our meetings recently.~|~translationMissing
Uwogo, have a messenger fetch him from his post.~|~translationMissing
Uwogo~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid all of our messengers are busy.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, perhaps you could make yourself useful after all, visitor. Why don't you run along to the gate and remind Kruk of our meeting.~|~translationMissing
Of course, my king.~|~translationMissing
Garkor isn't going to be happy when I tell him about this...~|~translationMissing
What was that? Is there a problem?~|~translationMissing
None at all.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. I must prepare for my meeting, Uwogo.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid your time with the king is up, you should fetch Kruk from his post on the gate.~|~translationMissing
I don't take orders from you!~|~translationMissing
Any idea where I can find Glough?~|~translationMissing
I don't know what you're talking about. We haven't been involved with Glough since he failed us.~|~translationMissing
He won't discuss his plans with anyone but his military commanders.~|~translationMissing
Ah, the monkey has more sense than we give him credit for... Perhaps you could go back in there as one of his commanders?~|~translationMissing
Zooknock could get you disguised as one of Awowogei's commanders if you retrieved the necessary items for him to make a greegree. We just need to choose which commander to go after...~|~translationMissing
Well Awowogei mentioned something about a meeting with Kruk. He wanted me to go to find him.~|~translationMissing
Kruk eh... Captain of the monkey guard would certainly be a useful disguise to have at our disposal. Hopefully you can find him somewhere isolated from the rest of the guards... Once you have defeated him, take his~|~translationMissing
corpse to Zooknock along with an uncharged monkey talisman, well, you know the routine.~|~translationMissing
I'm still working on getting that greegree.~|~translationMissing
Please hurry [player name], we need this information from Awowogei before it's too late.~|~translationMissing
Monkey Archer~|~translationMissing
The king has sent me with a message for Kruk, any idea where I can find him?~|~translationMissing
Your guess is as good as mine, you didn't hear it from me, but he's been disappearing from his post a lot lately...~|~translationMissing
You might be able to track him down if you've got what it takes, although I wouldn't want to be the one caught sneaking up on Kruk!~|~translationMissing
Any idea where to start looking?~|~translationMissing
There's only one way off the wall, and that's down the Western ramp to the shore. I know that's where I'd start looking.~|~translationMissing
Any luck finding Kruk?~|~translationMissing
You'd best not keep the king waiting, try tracking down Kruk's movements.~|~translationMissing
Stop right there, Kruk!~|~translationMissing
Kruk~|~translationMissing
I'm impressed you made it so far, human.~|~translationMissing
However, I'm afraid that this is the end of the line for you.~|~translationMissing
Ah finally, Kruk! I was beginning to think you had run into trouble...~|~translationMissing
Uh... No, everything is fine.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Have you had any further considerations for our plans?~|~translationMissing
And which plans would we be talking about here?~|~translationMissing
Are you sure everything is okay Kruk? You seem very distracted lately.~|~translationMissing
I'm fine, just been very busy thinking over those plans. Could you remind me where we left off last time?~|~translationMissing
We decided to move forward with our three-way assault.~|~translationMissing
You were negotiating an alliance with the ogres and trolls, working on a new fleet of battleships and then developing that secret weapon of yours.~|~translationMissing
So, how is progress of our plans coming along?~|~translationMissing
Don't let me down Kruk, we all know what is at stake here.~|~translationMissing
The monkeys are planning another attack!~|~translationMissing
Ah, this comes as little surprise. Did you uncover any details of the plans?~|~translationMissing
The assault is coming in three stages...~|~translationMissing
First, the monkeys wish to join into an alliance with the trolls and ogres...~|~translationMissing
That makes sense, it's no secret that those races are no fans of humans, other than perhaps as ingredients in a soup... What else did you learn?~|~translationMissing
The monkeys have been building a fleet of battleships.~|~translationMissing
That is odd, we have spies posted at the shipyard who haven't reported any news of this to us. I'll get a few scouts to look into it further. What's the final element to this attack?~|~translationMissing
Apparently Kruk has been working on a secret weapon, I've got no idea what it is.~|~translationMissing
Well then, that sounds ominous. I'll have some men look into it. For now, let's deal with the problems we can solve.~|~translationMissing
You must convince the trolls and ogres not to ally with the monkeys.~|~translationMissing
Any ideas on how?~|~translationMissing
You should pay a visit to the military officials of each race. I believe a troll general by the name of Kob is still filling that role in the Troll Stronghold. As for the ogres, I would recommend finding the head of the city~|~translationMissing
guard in Gu'Tanoth.~|~translationMissing
Kob~|~translationMissing
What you do here, human?~|~translationMissing
I know about your deal with the monkeys.~|~translationMissing
I know about your deal with the monkeys. I'm here to persuade you not to join their alliance.~|~translationMissing
Alliance? We plan to crush the hairy little men as soon as the humans are gone!~|~translationMissing
You won't be around to crush anyone when I'm done with you.~|~translationMissing
Ah, this food thinks it's a brave one, this will be fun!~|~translationMissing
Here's the game, I kill you, we help little hairy men kill all the humans. You kill me, we call off the attack.~|~translationMissing
I accept your challenge.~|~translationMissing
Maybe human not as brave as Kob thinks!~|~translationMissing
What would it take to persuade you not to attack the humans?~|~translationMissing
Humans are all so weak! There is nothing you can offer us to stop the attack!~|~translationMissing
I'll just be on my way.~|~translationMissing
I am Kob, mightiest of the troll generals!~|~translationMissing
Hurry before I get hungry!~|~translationMissing
Wait! Maybe battle to death is too much...~|~translationMissing
What about our deal?~|~translationMissing
You win, I will call off the attack.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for the head of the city guard...~|~translationMissing
Keef~|~translationMissing
You found him! What do you want, little human?~|~translationMissing
Hahaha! Monkeys offer us treasure, land and all the humans we can eat! What do you offer us?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I could offer you more?~|~translationMissing
I don't think human can offer me cities like the monkey king can!~|~translationMissing
Um... that's not going to work.~|~translationMissing
I offer to spare your life.~|~translationMissing
Little human is brave! I think I can offer you a deal...~|~translationMissing
If you can defeat me in battle, I will tell my men not to help the monkeys.~|~translationMissing
Nevermind.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a fight!~|~translationMissing
Hahaha, human is funny! You will barely fill my stomach, stop wasting my time!~|~translationMissing
Stop! Stop! You prove you are very strong, little human!~|~translationMissing
A deal is a deal. We will not be allies with the monkeys.~|~translationMissing
I have convinced the ogres and trolls not to form an alliance with the monkeys.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work, [player name].~|~translationMissing
I have had my men look into this supposed fleet of battleships. The shipyard has turned up nothing, although, someone did say they saw a familiar face sneaking around town.~|~translationMissing
An old pilot from the stronghold, he went by the name of Le Smith. I hadn't heard of him since he was dismissed from the glider regiment.~|~translationMissing
Right. He's the one who flew Glough here...~|~translationMissing
If that's the case then he's likely to have information we could use. You should track him down and see what you can learn.~|~translationMissing
Any idea where I should start looking?~|~translationMissing
Your guess is as good as mine - he must be somewhere on Ape Atoll.~|~translationMissing
Assistant Le Smith~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't have an amulet of monkey speak.~|~translationMissing
That's okay, I am wearing my... uh... amulet of human speak.~|~translationMissing
Oh, right... What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
I was going to ask you the same question.~|~translationMissing
Glough told me not to talk to anyone while I'm here.~|~translationMissing
So you're here with Glough?~|~translationMissing
I've already said too much. Please, leave me be.~|~translationMissing
Why is that?~|~translationMissing
The fleet must be kept top secret... Agh! Forget I said anything.~|~translationMissing
Awowogei has already informed me about the battleships.~|~translationMissing
Awowogei has already informed me about the battleships. In fact, he sent me here to check up on your progress.~|~translationMissing
So what is it you want to know?~|~translationMissing
Where is the fleet, currently?~|~translationMissing
Where is the fleet? The shipyard still seems pretty bare.~|~translationMissing
Aha! The shipyard? Of course you aren't going to find anything there!~|~translationMissing
Aha... right... Of course?~|~translationMissing
The airships are being built just off the coast of Ape Atoll.~|~translationMissing
Airships!? I mean... Right.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I have to get back to work. Let Awowogei know everything is on schedule.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I know enough already.~|~translationMissing
What fleet are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
King Awowogei has sent me to find Glough.~|~translationMissing
Well you're not going to find him up here. I'm afraid I'm too busy to chat right now.~|~translationMissing
I was just admiring the view.~|~translationMissing
Me too, it's perfect conditions for my test flight.~|~translationMissing
Good for you, I'll just be on my way.~|~translationMissing
Test flight?~|~translationMissing
Oh sorry, ignore that. I just meant it's a lovely day.~|~translationMissing
I was just leaving.~|~translationMissing
Assistant Le Smith?~|~translationMissing
Yes? Wait... what are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
I've already said too much, human. Please, leave me be.~|~translationMissing
Odd, I didn't think Awowogei was the type to work with humans...~|~translationMissing
Um.. I am a prisoner of war here, Awowogei gets me to run errands.~|~translationMissing
King Narnode has sent me to find Glough.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about... I'm just here on vacation!~|~translationMissing
I've spoken to Assistant Le Smith.~|~translationMissing
What have you learned?~|~translationMissing
He mentioned something about airships being built off the coast of Ape Atoll.~|~translationMissing
Airships? No wonder we didn't find anything at the shipyard... You'll have to do something about them.~|~translationMissing
What can I do?~|~translationMissing
Firstly, you have to find out where they're constructing these airships...~|~translationMissing
Once you've found the location, you'll have to find a way to sabotage the airships.~|~translationMissing
Monkey guard~|~translationMissing
What's going on here?~|~translationMissing
I'm keeping watch on who comes and goes from the construction platform.~|~translationMissing
Construction platform?~|~translationMissing
If the player is not disguised~|~translationMissing
There's a large scale construction project taking place offshore.~|~translationMissing
Can I visit the platform?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid only authorised personnel are allowed to visit the platform.~|~translationMissing
If the player is disguised as Kruk~|~translationMissing
Yes, sir. The engineers needed a large open space to construct the fleet, an offshore platform was the obvious solution.~|~translationMissing
Of course, sir.~|~translationMissing
Okay. See you around.~|~translationMissing
I was just passing through.~|~translationMissing
I was just passing through. Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
There must be some kind of explosive somewhere on this platform that I can use...~|~translationMissing
That should be enough, now I just have to get back to the boat...~|~translationMissing
I've destroyed the airships!~|~translationMissing
Excellent, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
While you were away, we managed to uncover something quite unsettling.~|~translationMissing
We were investigating the tunnels where you found Kruk, and discovered an entrance to a much deeper cavern.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, we were unable to access the entrance ourselves, there was some magical force stopping us from getting through.~|~translationMissing
We are fairly confident this is where the 'secret weapon' Kruk was working on is being developed, you'll have to find a way into the area.~|~translationMissing
How do you expect me to find a way through the magical barrier?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you'll find a way, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Have you found out any more about the 'secret weapon' Kruk was working on?~|~translationMissing
Please hurry, [player name], we need to find out what we're up against here.~|~translationMissing
Kruk! Where have you been? The experiments have broken out of their cages again, get them back under control before they destroy any more of my work!~|~translationMissing
Good work getting them back under control Kruk.~|~translationMissing
Umesc pro ta lauf!~|~translationMissing
Clearly that last strain of the mutagen was too unstable...~|~translationMissing
Mutagen?~|~translationMissing
Right... I forgot I don't keep you around for your brains.~|~translationMissing
I've been experimenting on those specimens you've been gathering for me.~|~translationMissing
I've been trying to find a mutagen stable enough to allow me to have control over the creatures, whilst keeping them aggressive enough to tear apart anything that stands in our way.~|~translationMissing
I think I may have finally found the perfect balance, however, I will need time to carry out some final tests.~|~translationMissing
How big is this army of creatures?~|~translationMissing
I'm only using our test subjects at the moment, however, once I've processed the mutagen into an airborne form, I'll be able to unleash it across all of Ape Atoll!~|~translationMissing
Glough pulls a nearby lever.~|~translationMissing
All that we have to do now is wait for the mutagen to infuse power from these charged onyx gems.~|~translationMissing
I'm going to find out where Le Smith has disappeared to, I'll let you know when I next require your services. Farewell, Kruk.~|~translationMissing
Umesc pro ta andra!~|~translationMissing
You carefully remove the gems from the glowing orb.~|~translationMissing
Using your knowledge of crafting, your carefully reshape the onyx. Any flow of energy through the gem will now be inverted.~|~translationMissing
You carefully replace the gem, you notice the flow of energy reverse.~|~translationMissing
I should check what effect this has had on the mutagen.~|~translationMissing
Energy appears to have drained from the incubator. The mutagen has been successfully corrupted.~|~translationMissing
I've taken care of Glough's secret weapon, he was working on some kind of mutagen for apes.~|~translationMissing
Good work, [player name]! Now all that's left to do is inform Awowogei of his failed plans. If he has any sense, he will call off his plans for attack.~|~translationMissing
Have you informed Awowogei of his failed plans?~|~translationMissing
Please hurry, [player name], we are so close to victory!~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I have bad news.~|~translationMissing
The trolls and ogres have backed out of our alliance...~|~translationMissing
The fleet of battleships will not be ready in time for our attack...~|~translationMissing
This is a disaster! What about your secret weapon?~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately there have been some complications, the weapon is still too unstable for use on the battlefield.~|~translationMissing
Agh! You have left me no choice but to cancel our assault on the mainland...~|~translationMissing
You have failed me for the last time, Kruk, you are hereby stripped of your rank and duties. Uwogo, cancel all of my upcoming meetings, I need some time alone.~|~translationMissing
You are not welcome here, Kruk.~|~translationMissing
Yes, and he has called off the attack!~|~translationMissing
I knew you could do it, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
It would appear your mission on Ape Atoll is complete. You should inform the king that we've located Glough and thwarted Awowogei's plans. While you're ...~|~translationMissing
The player's screen rumbles...~|~translationMissing
Huh? What was that?~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays in which a large looming shadow is spotted to the east.~|~translationMissing
You said you dealt with the airships, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
I thought I did!~|~translationMissing
The camera pans to the looming shadow, and the screen fades to black.~|~translationMissing
Huaarghh! I knew I couldn't rely on these primitive apes, I'll just have to do this myself!~|~translationMissing
Le Smith, set our course for the Grand Tree, let's end this once and for all!~|~translationMissing
Yes, sir.~|~translationMissing
The camera returns to the player and Garkor.~|~translationMissing
We have to stop Glough! Get back to the Stronghold and warn the king before it's too late! I'll get the rest of the 10th squad together and we'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
There's no time for chatting, [player name]! You need to get back to the Gnome Stronghold!~|~translationMissing
How is the mission going, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I found Glough, he's headed for the Stronghold! We need to evacuate!~|~translationMissing
Evacuate? I think you're overreacting... My troops can handle Glough.~|~translationMissing
You don't understand, he has an airship and army of demonic experiments!~|~translationMissing
This is bad... I will put the troops on high alert. And... Well, we do have someone else who may be able to help...~|~translationMissing
Nieve is the most highly skilled warrior we have here, get her assistance and defend the Stronghold.~|~translationMissing
Get Nieve and defend the Stronghold, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Talk about Monkey Madness II.~|~translationMissing
Nieve~|~translationMissing
Glough is leading an attack on the Stronghold with an army of demonic creatures! We need your help!~|~translationMissing
It's a long story, the king has requested that you join me in assisting the troops with the Stronghold's defence.~|~translationMissing
I am unable to leave my post unattended, I'll have to bring in a replacement while I'm helping. Are you sure you want me to join you?~|~translationMissing
Recruit Nieve?~|~translationMissing
You should pick up your pet first. It would only get in the way.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a pet following them~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays in which Glough's airship arrives at the Stronghold.~|~translationMissing
What in Gielinor is that thing?~|~translationMissing
It's Glough's airship - and it's heading straight for the Grand Tree!~|~translationMissing
Sir, those experiments of yours are out of control back there, isn't there something you can do?~|~translationMissing
Just focus on piloting the ship! Narnode isn't going to know what's hit him!~|~translationMissing
But sir, it's only a matter of time before they... Agghh!~|~translationMissing
The camera returns to the player and Garkor. The screen rumbles...~|~translationMissing
Huh? It completely missed the Grand Tree! We should head North to the crash site...~|~translationMissing
Wait, look! Some of those things have broken into the Stronghold! We have to stop them, let's go!~|~translationMissing
Come on, [player name], we've got to defend the Stronghold!~|~translationMissing
I'll meet you back at the Grand Tree, [player name].~|~translationMissing
I think we've dealt with enough of these things, the troops can handle the rest! Let's join the 10th squad by the breach in the outer wall to the North.~|~translationMissing
Good work, [player name], my troops can take it from here. You and Nieve should investigate the crash site.~|~translationMissing
We'll head there now.~|~translationMissing
Lumo~|~translationMissing
Don't just stand there, [player name], help us deal with these abominations!~|~translationMissing
Good work dealing with those abominations, [player name], you should talk to the commander.~|~translationMissing
Some of those things have made it into the Stronghold, you've got to defeat them, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
We'll keep the breach secure, [player name]. You should head to the crash site to make sure Glough is dealt with, once and for all.~|~translationMissing
No problem, I'll finish this once and for all.~|~translationMissing
If Nieve is not following the player~|~translationMissing
I know you're tough, [player name], but it would be unwise to head out there on your own. Get Nieve and then come back.~|~translationMissing
You. Always it's you. Have you any idea how sick I am of you? What have you even got against me?~|~translationMissing
Surrender to us, Glough, or I swear by my shiny blue shield that I will end you right here.~|~translationMissing
Oh, will you? The lady talks tough. Let's see how you fare against my best pets!~|~translationMissing
Tortured gorillas jump down from high ground.~|~translationMissing
Hahahaha!~|~translationMissing
Bah! Never trust a monkey to do a gnome's work.~|~translationMissing
I guess I'll just have to deal with you two meddling buffoons myself!~|~translationMissing
He has the mutagen! We have to stop him!~|~translationMissing
Nieve, wait!~|~translationMissing
Glough consumes the mutagen, turning him into a giant abomination. Nieve closes in to attack, but is shoved away to the nearby wall with such force that upon colliding with it, a rock collapses onto her, killing her instantly.~|~translationMissing
Nooooooooo!~|~translationMissing
You'll pay for this Glough!~|~translationMissing
Glough smashes a nearby boulder and retreats further into the caverns.~|~translationMissing
Glough falls, but the cavern begins to collapse.~|~translationMissing
Uh oh!~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to white, and the player appears by the cavern entrance.~|~translationMissing
Zooknock~|~translationMissing
[player name], are you okay? We detected a very powerful presence in the caverns and decided to pull you out, I couldn't get a lock on Nieve, is she alright?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid she didn't make it... It was Glough, he injected himself with the demonic mutagen he had been developing... He was too powerful...~|~translationMissing
And what of Glough now?~|~translationMissing
He's not a problem any longer.~|~translationMissing
I hope you are right, [player name].~|~translationMissing
You should report back to the king, I can teleport you to the Grand Tree if you would like?~|~translationMissing
Carado~|~translationMissing
Report back to the king as soon as possible.~|~translationMissing
Glough has been defeated, and his demonic creations are trapped deep within the caverns to the North.~|~translationMissing
The monkeys were planning another attack, however, I managed to sabotage their plans.~|~translationMissing
This is excellent news, [player name]. Where is Nieve?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid she didn't make it.~|~translationMissing
Her sacrifice will not be forgotten.~|~translationMissing
I have received word from monkey messengers that Awowogei himself wishes to make a visit to the Stronghold...~|~translationMissing
Apparently he wishes to set up an agreement of peace between Ape Atoll and the mainland.~|~translationMissing
A peace treaty... Do you trust him?~|~translationMissing
I don't have a choice. It would be foolish to decline such an offer, there may not be many more opportunities for peace between our kingdoms.~|~translationMissing
So, what now?~|~translationMissing
Rest, [player name], you have earned it. I will have you summoned when the peace agreement is complete, you should be present during a moment of such historic importance.~|~translationMissing
The meeting between King Narnode Shareen and King Awowogei begins.~|~translationMissing
So, I hear you were the one to foil Glough's plans. Thank you, human, he had been setting our kingdoms against one another for far too long.~|~translationMissing
Finally, there can be peace between Ape Atoll and the mainland. [player name], you are welcome to visit Ape Atoll whenever you please, we will be opening our gates to the outside world for the first time.~|~translationMissing
Awowogei has allowed us to set up a Gnome glider route to Marim, you are welcome to use it as you wish.~|~translationMissing
Please, feel free to talk to the new head of the Ape Atoll guard, Duke, about advanced combat training, should you wish to receive it.~|~translationMissing
I must be heading back now. Farewell, King Narnode, and thank you again, [player name].~|~translationMissing
On behalf of the Gnomes I can only thank you, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude for your services to our people.~|~translationMissing
This is one of my personal seed pods, handed down through the generations of my family.~|~translationMissing
Simply commune with a pod and you'll be teleported right here to the Grand Tree.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, King Narnode!~|~translationMissing

You tie the rope around the boulder and prepare to climb down.~|~translationMissing
You pull on the rope and miraculously, it comes loose.~|~translationMissing
Hamal the Chieftain~|~translationMissing
Greetings, outerlander, I am Hamal. I am the chieftain of this tribe.~|~translationMissing
And my name is [player name], honourable chieftain.~|~translationMissing
Ah, an outerlander with manners.~|~translationMissing
So tell me what you want from us.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm a Fremennik.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm a Fremennik, not an outerlander.~|~translationMissing
We are not Fremennik, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
But you look like Fremennik!~|~translationMissing
And you do not look like a Fremennik, but still claim to be one.~|~translationMissing
But I will not deceive you. We were part of the Fremennik once, but left the village of Rellekka long ago.~|~translationMissing
So what are you doing up here?~|~translationMissing
That's fascinating.~|~translationMissing
That's fascinating, but I'm afraid I have other things to do at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Why is everyone so hostile?~|~translationMissing
Why is everyone being so hostile to me?~|~translationMissing
We are a solitary group, outerlander, and have little experience or interest in outside contact.~|~translationMissing
It is also our custom not to talk to outerlanders without my sanction. And I see no reason to sanction it for you.~|~translationMissing
So what are you lot all doing up here in the mountains?~|~translationMissing
We left Rellekka because we wanted to live closer to nature. We feel that the people of Rellekka have grown complacent and rely too much on their tools rather than their skill. And while they share our view on the sanctity of the runestones, they still employ and actively use magic.~|~translationMissing
Their Seer is an affront to the gods!~|~translationMissing
Anyway.~|~translationMissing
We do not recognise the council of Rellekka and want nothing more to do with them. We live on rock and stone now, pure and hard.~|~translationMissing
We move on to another part of the mountain slope when the rough land cannot sustain us anymore.~|~translationMissing
That said, we have tarried at this location for too long and should be moving on.~|~translationMissing
So why are you still here?~|~translationMissing
For one thing, this side of the mountain is mostly free from the menace of the trolls and the delvings of the deformed dwarves.~|~translationMissing
Well, you see...~|~translationMissing
My daughter has gone missing. We have been looking for her and cannot go on without her.~|~translationMissing
I will search for her!~|~translationMissing
A damsel in distress! I will search for her!~|~translationMissing
Haha, you have spirit, [player name].~|~translationMissing
But we do not employ outerlanders.~|~translationMissing
You don't need to employ me! Just let me look for her.~|~translationMissing
That seems acceptable to me. Very well, I will allow you to look for her.~|~translationMissing
I will instruct my people to let you roam about the area freely, and give limited consent to them to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
Great! I'll be back with her soon. Just wait here.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'll be waiting here alright.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to hear that.~|~translationMissing
We do not need your sympathy, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
Maybe the trolls got her?~|~translationMissing
Do not say such things in jest, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
Besides, stealth and kidnapping is not their way.~|~translationMissing
Forget it then.~|~translationMissing
Forget it then, you can figure it out on your own.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'll stop talking to you then.~|~translationMissing
As you wish, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a quest!~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a quest! Do you have any for me?~|~translationMissing
We do not employ outerlanders.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I know the drill, where do I sign up for the trials to join your tribe?~|~translationMissing
And we certainly don't let them join us!~|~translationMissing
Any idea on where I should start looking?~|~translationMissing
Uhm... any idea on where I should start looking for your daughter?~|~translationMissing
There is a large pool of water beyond the camp. She used to go there often, it was her favourite spot.~|~translationMissing
Ragnar, her fiance, is probably there as well. I will give him my permission to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
What does your daughter look like?~|~translationMissing
She is the fairest maiden of all our tribe, and I daresay of all the northern lands. She has flowing black hair, and when last we saw her, she was wearing a brown dress.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you should speak to the man she is to marry, tribesman Ragnar. He can probably tell you more.~|~translationMissing
You can find him out by the pool beyond the camp, where my daughter used to go so often.~|~translationMissing
Depending on which camp dweller is spoken to, different dialogue is given.~|~translationMissing
Option 1~|~translationMissing
Hello! I'm trying to help your chieftain here.~|~translationMissing
Camp dweller~|~translationMissing
We don't need any help.~|~translationMissing
Option 2~|~translationMissing
Hello there! Can you help me?~|~translationMissing
The camp dweller shakes his head.~|~translationMissing
Option 3~|~translationMissing
Stay away from me, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
Option 4~|~translationMissing
I think I need some help.~|~translationMissing
Well, yes...~|~translationMissing
Run along then!~|~translationMissing
Option 5~|~translationMissing
Hello, I'm-~|~translationMissing
But I-~|~translationMissing
Isn't there-~|~translationMissing
Can you come and help me? The chieftain's daughter-~|~translationMissing
No, outerlander, I'm guarding this mountain pass from trolls and inquisitive people like you.~|~translationMissing
Doesn't look like you were very successful in the last regard.~|~translationMissing
If the chieftain would let me, I would correct that oversight.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea where the chieftain's daughter is?~|~translationMissing
Jokul~|~translationMissing
That's what we would all like to know.~|~translationMissing
Ragnar~|~translationMissing
So, you are the outerlander whom Hamal said would look for Asleif.~|~translationMissing
You don't even know her name!~|~translationMissing
I am sorry outerlander, I have not spoken with your kind for a long time and I'm not feeling so well. You see, I was set to marry Asleif, the most beautiful woman ever to grace this world.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea where she might be?~|~translationMissing
She used to come here every day, you know, whenever our camp was set up in the vicinity. She would come to sing, her voice reflecting on the mountains and falling into the pool like sparkling silver. Sometimes I think I can hear her singing, but when I follow the sound around the pool I just end up here again.~|~translationMissing
So... do you have any idea where she might be now?~|~translationMissing
We were supposed to meet here, at the tree by the pool. I think if I wait long enough maybe she will show up again.~|~translationMissing
But... you don't actually have any idea where she is right at the moment?~|~translationMissing
If I knew I wouldn't be standing here, would I?~|~translationMissing
What do you mean, my kind?~|~translationMissing
What do you mean, my kind? I'm a Fremennik you know.~|~translationMissing
Yet you still use magic, I assume, and have little actual knowledge of the earth and the rock that you stand on every day.~|~translationMissing
Then you are an ignorant, an insult to the gods... and an outerlander.~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, you made your point!~|~translationMissing
You dig up some mud with your bare hands. Yuck, now they're all sticky.~|~translationMissing
Great, now the tree bar isn't slippery anymore!~|~translationMissing
You jump up to grab the bark of the tree...~|~translationMissing
...crawl along the branch...~|~translationMissing
...and jump down to the little island!~|~translationMissing
If the player uses an appropriate staff~|~translationMissing
You plant your staff into the clump of rocks...~|~translationMissing
...then successfully jump across!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't use an appropriate staff~|~translationMissing
You slip and fall into the water!~|~translationMissing
You only just manage to get to shore!~|~translationMissing
If the player uses a plank~|~translationMissing
You place the plank on the two flat stones...~|~translationMissing
...then successfully walk across!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't use a plank~|~translationMissing
You can clearly hear the voice coming from the water now.~|~translationMissing
'[player name]... [player name]!'~|~translationMissing
Er... yes, hello?~|~translationMissing
'Listen to me, [player name], listen to what I will say.'~|~translationMissing
I think I'm going mad.~|~translationMissing
I think I'm going mad, I'm starting to hear things.~|~translationMissing
Hello! Who are you?~|~translationMissing
Hello! Who are you? And where for that matter?~|~translationMissing
'I am all around you. I am the soft singing in the wind. I am the faint rippling of the water. I am the stone of the rocks around you.'~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose that answered both questions then.~|~translationMissing
'I am the voice of Asleif, daughter of Hamal, son of Wulfgard.'~|~translationMissing
Wait, you're Asleif? I think I was looking for you! Where are you hiding?~|~translationMissing
'Asleif is no longer in your world, she dwells in the halls of her ancestors now.'~|~translationMissing
But I thought you said you were Asleif?~|~translationMissing
'I am but the voice of her, an echo of the past, reflected on the water. A tiny part of her spirit.'~|~translationMissing
I think I'd better have a lie down.~|~translationMissing
I think I'd better have a lie down, I'm starting to get a little dizzy.~|~translationMissing
So what exactly do you want from me?~|~translationMissing
'I am greatly concerned for the people who were once my tribesmen. You must help me, [player name], for their current course will lead to their doom.'~|~translationMissing
Er, I don't think they like the idea of me helping them.~|~translationMissing
'Listen to me, and judge then if you think yourself capable or not.'~|~translationMissing
'My people have, as is their way, isolated themselves from the rest of the world. There is no one for them to turn to in times of need.'~|~translationMissing
'Our tribesmen are the children of the Fremennik of Rellekka. The parting was a bitter affair and the two groups never forgave each other.'~|~translationMissing
'I ask you, [player name], to help bring these two people closer together again.'~|~translationMissing
That sounds like something I can do.~|~translationMissing
All right, that sounds like something I can do.~|~translationMissing
'There is another thing, [player name], that I ask of you.'~|~translationMissing
'My father has not moved camp for far too long. There is very little food now for my people. You must find a new supply of food for them, for I fear the worst.'~|~translationMissing
So let's see, peace with Rellekka, and a new supply of food.'~|~translationMissing
'Thank you, [player name], and may the gods bless you on your journey.'~|~translationMissing
I'm not really a farmer.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but I'm not really a farmer. You'll have to find someone else.~|~translationMissing
'I am sad to hear that, [player name], but you must do what you think is right.'~|~translationMissing
I'm not really a diplomat.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but I'm not really a diplomat. You'll have to find someone else.~|~translationMissing
Don't tell me, there's an anthem involved?~|~translationMissing
'Your words are not clear to me. But please, try to find a way to bring our people closer together again.'~|~translationMissing
Do you wish to return to shore?~|~translationMissing
With a lot of effort you manage to get back to shore.~|~translationMissing
I spoke to Asleif!~|~translationMissing
Really? You found her? Where is she, tell me!~|~translationMissing
Well... there's something you should know.~|~translationMissing
Er, she's sort of... well...~|~translationMissing
She's sort of dead.~|~translationMissing
What? Do not say such things! Tell me where you saw her!~|~translationMissing
I didn't actually see her, not as such. But I did talk to her, right there, on that island in the center of the pool.~|~translationMissing
That island is bare! There's no one there! Do not try to deceive me, outerlander, she is not dead and you did not talk to her!~|~translationMissing
Fine, don't believe me then.~|~translationMissing
I have found your daughter!~|~translationMissing
Where is she? Tell me, outerlander!~|~translationMissing
Well, er, she is dead.~|~translationMissing
Do not play games with me. I gave you leave to walk about our camp, not to trick us.~|~translationMissing
About the people of Rellekka...~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet helped Svidi~|~translationMissing
Why do you hate them so much?~|~translationMissing
We do not hate them, outerlander, but we do not approve of their ways either.~|~translationMissing
But don't you basically believe in the same things?~|~translationMissing
It is true that our beliefs are not all that different, but we have a different way of applying them, a stricter way.~|~translationMissing
So you've never considered, say, making peace with them?~|~translationMissing
We are not at war with them, outerlander, but we try to ignore each other.~|~translationMissing
But I must admit that I have, in fact, sent out a representative to Rellekka to talk about improving relations and perhaps setting up a basic trade route.~|~translationMissing
Great! Well, that was easy.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately we have not heard from Svidi, our representative, for a few days.~|~translationMissing
Shall I go looking for him as well then?~|~translationMissing
Do as you wish, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
If the player has helped Svidi~|~translationMissing
I did it, I persuaded Brundt to speak to your representative!~|~translationMissing
Indeed, outerlander, and how did you accomplish that without giving him our rock?~|~translationMissing
Well, yeah, I need to talk to you about that...~|~translationMissing
Worry not, you made a wise decision and your boldness is impressive.~|~translationMissing
It does not matter, after all, how large the rock is, or what its shape is. And perhaps the two halves of the rock will have extra symbolism now, representing the two halves of the Fremennik culture.~|~translationMissing
I understand that Svidi's meeting with Brundt went quite well. I must thank you for your assistance, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
About your food supplies...~|~translationMissing
From what I understand you're starting to run out?~|~translationMissing
Where did you get that idea from, outerlander?~|~translationMissing
Er, I just happened to overhear it.~|~translationMissing
There is some truth to it, yes. If it were not for my missing daughter, we would have moved on already, and finding food would be easier again for a while.~|~translationMissing
Can I help you with finding a new supply of food?~|~translationMissing
I would be interested to see how you would manage that, outerlander. But if you insist on trying, go ahead.~|~translationMissing
Go, outerlander, and do not hurry back.~|~translationMissing
You climb onto the rock...~|~translationMissing
...and step down the other side.~|~translationMissing
Are you, by any chance, Svidi? Sent by Hamal to talk to Brundt and the council of Rellekka?~|~translationMissing
Svidi~|~translationMissing
Maybe... who is asking? You're an outerlander, aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but Hamal asked me to rescue you from a Rellekka prison. What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
I haven't actually been in Rellekka yet...~|~translationMissing
Why, can't you find the way?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm not actually sure if I should go in there, you see.~|~translationMissing
I've always been told that the people of Rellekka are ignorants, almost as bad as other outerlanders. I think they might kill me if I go there.~|~translationMissing
Nonsense. I'm an outerlander and I haven't killed you either!~|~translationMissing
Yes, but you're on your own, they have a whole village.~|~translationMissing
So I don't want to go in there, but I don't want to go back to the camp and tell Hamal that I didn't dare to go to Rellekka either.~|~translationMissing
Aren't you supposed to be a ferocious warrior?~|~translationMissing
Not all of us are warriors.~|~translationMissing
Some of us are schooled in the fine art of diplomacy.~|~translationMissing
Can't I persuade you to go in there somehow?~|~translationMissing
I won't go in there unless I know it's safe.~|~translationMissing
Do you want me to go with you as your bodyguard?~|~translationMissing
You? But you're an outerlander! You'd probably lead me to a cave to kill me yourself!~|~translationMissing
What if I get you some kind of guarantee of safe passage from the village? Will that do?~|~translationMissing
Hmmmm...~|~translationMissing
Yes, that will do.~|~translationMissing
Weren't you on your way to Rellekka?~|~translationMissing
Weren't you on your way to get me a guarantee of safe passage into Rellekka?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, I almost forgot.~|~translationMissing
Brundt gave me the guarantee of safe passage to give to you!~|~translationMissing
Let me see that, I want to be sure it's authentic.~|~translationMissing
Player gives the safety guarantee to Svidi~|~translationMissing
Okay, this looks valid enough. I'll go and talk to Brundt.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the mountain camp.~|~translationMissing
The chieftain from the mountain camp has sent a representative to Rellekka!~|~translationMissing
If the player is a Fremennik~|~translationMissing
That is intriguing news, [player name], but we have not seen him yet.~|~translationMissing
If the player is an outlander~|~translationMissing
Very unusual, outerlander, but we have not seen him yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's the problem, he doesn't dare to come into Rellekka. He's afraid he's going to get hurt.~|~translationMissing
What? He's not much of a warrior, is he?~|~translationMissing
That's what I thought. He says he wants a guarantee of safety.~|~translationMissing
I will meet with this man on one condition, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
When their group split off from Rellekka, they stole one of the ancient relics of the Fremennik. Our ancient rock.~|~translationMissing
Ancient rock? What did it do?~|~translationMissing
Do?~|~translationMissing
Did it contain vast magical powers?~|~translationMissing
Did it give the owner unimaginable strength?~|~translationMissing
Was it the eternal prison of an immortal demon?~|~translationMissing
No, no, no. Little do you understand our ways, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
The rock was just that, a rock. It had no special properties and was in essence no different from any other rock.~|~translationMissing
So what did it mean?~|~translationMissing
It symbolised our refusal to use the runestones for ourselves, instead relying on our own abilities.~|~translationMissing
The people you speak of took the stone with them when they left for the mountains. They claimed their way of living was more pure and closer to nature.~|~translationMissing
And is that true?~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but where's the harm in a bit of feasting from time to time?~|~translationMissing
In any case, before the council and I meet with anyone from their camp, they will have to give our rock back.~|~translationMissing
Did it look pretty?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, not especially I think...~|~translationMissing
Why won't you meet with the representative of the mountain camp?~|~translationMissing
Like I said, we don't want anything to do with them until they give back our ancient rock.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I might as well let you pass now, since I can't seem to stop you anyway.~|~translationMissing
Just remember that I'm watching you.~|~translationMissing
What is it, outerlander?~|~translationMissing
Chieftain Brundt says that he won't meet with Svidi unless you give him back some rock or other.~|~translationMissing
What, do you mean our ancient rock that our fathers took with them when they left the ignorants of Rellekka?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's the one.~|~translationMissing
Out of the question. That rock belongs to us. It symbolises what we stand for. What would Brundt want with it anyway?~|~translationMissing
So I can't persuade you to part with the rock?~|~translationMissing
Did you not hear me the first time, outerlander? It belongs to us, we will not part with it.~|~translationMissing
You go into the peculiar looking tent.~|~translationMissing
You take a look around and see none of the camp dwellers about...~|~translationMissing
With a few swings of your pick, you split off a part of the rock and sneakily put it in your pocket.~|~translationMissing
What do you have there, outerlander? It's not our rock, is it?~|~translationMissing
No, of course not! See? It's a completely different rock, it's much smaller.~|~translationMissing
Alright, you be on your way then.~|~translationMissing
I've brought you back your rock!~|~translationMissing
Really? Let me see!~|~translationMissing
Player gives half a rock to Brundt~|~translationMissing
This rock seems a lot smaller than our bard made it out to be.~|~translationMissing
Well, it's not the whole rock, it's part of the rock...~|~translationMissing
I split it in two.~|~translationMissing
You truly have the Fremennik spirit in you, [player name][sic]~|~translationMissing
You are unusually insightful for an outerlander!~|~translationMissing
Yes, we are satisfied with sharing the rock. I'll meet with this representative and will inform the council to join us here in the longhall.~|~translationMissing
Can I have that guarantee of safe passage, then, to give to the representative?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, here it is.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a safety guarantee.)~|~translationMissing
But first things first. Did Svidi go into Rellekka yet, to speak to Brundt on behalf of our tribe?~|~translationMissing
Oops, I completely forgot about that. I'd better hurry back to him.~|~translationMissing
How goes the goat herding?~|~translationMissing
It goes, outerlander...~|~translationMissing
Times are hard here at the moment. We've been here for too long and there is not much food left, or places where I can take my goats.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm trying to find a new supply of food for your people. Any ideas on where to start?~|~translationMissing
If only it were so easy!~|~translationMissing
That being said...~|~translationMissing
Yes..?~|~translationMissing
I have heard there is a certain kind of fruit... that will grow even here, in the mountains.~|~translationMissing
What's the name of the fruit?~|~translationMissing
It is called White Pearl, named after its white appearance.~|~translationMissing
Any ideas on where to find some?~|~translationMissing
I do not know. I believe it grows mainly in the mountains, and it can grow in even the most difficult circumstances.~|~translationMissing
We cannot move on until we find the chieftain's daughter, and we do not generally move far inland. But perhaps you can search for it.~|~translationMissing
I'll see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
Where could I find that fruit again?~|~translationMissing
You mean the White Pearl?~|~translationMissing
I do not know, outerlander, but you might want to try looking on mountains.~|~translationMissing
What about this one?~|~translationMissing
No, if it grew on here I would have known.~|~translationMissing
If the player has appropriate gloves on~|~translationMissing
Your gloves protect you from the thorns as you pick the White Pearl fruit.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have appropriate gloves on~|~translationMissing
Ouch! You just stuck your hand into some very sharp thorns.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a white pearl~|~translationMissing
No need, you already have one of these.~|~translationMissing
Eating the white pearl~|~translationMissing
{{mes|You eat the White Pearl and spit out the seed when you're done. Mmm, tasty.~|~translationMissing
Getting another white pearl after eating it~|~translationMissing
You're content with having the seed of the fruit.~|~translationMissing
Trying to pick up a seed off the floor when you already have one~|~translationMissing
One seed should be enough.~|~translationMissing
Look, I found the White Pearl fruit!~|~translationMissing
You seem to be quite resourceful, outerlander. Go and show it to the chieftain.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the white pearl~|~translationMissing
Here, I have something that might interest you.~|~translationMissing
It's White Pearl fruit, which grows in even the hardiest circumstances. I found this growing on White Wolf Mountain.~|~translationMissing
And what use is one piece of fruit to us, outerlander? It won't feed our tribe for even a day.~|~translationMissing
Oops, I hadn't thought of that.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the white pearl seed~|~translationMissing
I've found this seed that may be of interest to you.~|~translationMissing
Interesting, what is it?~|~translationMissing
It's the seed of the White Pearl fruit. It grows on White Wolf mountain, even in the snow.~|~translationMissing
With luck, you'll be able to grow it here as well.~|~translationMissing
This is a great gift, [player name], which I humbly accept.~|~translationMissing
Player gives the white pearl seed to Hamal.~|~translationMissing
I must thank you for your generous gift, outerlander.~|~translationMissing
Gift?~|~translationMissing
Yes, the seed of the White Pearl. It grows remarkably well.~|~translationMissing
Ah... well, glad to be of help.~|~translationMissing
Hamal, I'm sorry, but your daughter is dead.~|~translationMissing
I told you before not to say such things.~|~translationMissing
What proof of it do you have anyway?~|~translationMissing
Ehm, none really...~|~translationMissing
Then do not say it again. I appreciate what you've done for us already, but don't try our patience.~|~translationMissing
Hey, ehm... Asleif spirit thing? Hello?~|~translationMissing
'Yes, [player name]?'~|~translationMissing
I did what you asked me to! I improved the relations between Rellekka and the mountain camp, and I found a new supply of food!~|~translationMissing
'Yes, [player name], I can sense that this is so.'~|~translationMissing
So do you have any other quests for me, perhaps with some bigger rewards?~|~translationMissing
'I do not fully understand what you speak of, but I do have one more task I would like you to do.'~|~translationMissing
'My father does not believe that I am dead. In his heart, he knows it to be true, but he cannot accept it.'~|~translationMissing
'You must convince him, [player name]. Once you have convinced my father, everyone else in the camp will follow him. Then, perhaps, they can move on again.'~|~translationMissing
How do I do that, exactly? I don't think I'll be able to get him down to this little island.~|~translationMissing
'I must leave that to you. All I know is that I was attacked by some creature or animal while I was sitting by the lake. It dragged me off and I remember nothing else.'~|~translationMissing
'Perhaps this will help you, I cannot provide further assistance.'~|~translationMissing
You take a very deep breath...~|~translationMissing
The Kendal~|~translationMissing
{{overhead|Do not attack me, puny mortal [player name]!~|~translationMissing
I did not give you permission to touch that, mortal!~|~translationMissing
This bear has no quarrel with you.~|~translationMissing
Errr... hello?~|~translationMissing
Who dares to disturb my slumber?~|~translationMissing
It's just me, no one special.~|~translationMissing
It's just me, [player name], no one special.~|~translationMissing
Have you come, then, to pay your respects?~|~translationMissing
How... exactly do I do that?~|~translationMissing
With your blood, mortal!~|~translationMissing
Time to go!~|~translationMissing
Time to go, see you later!~|~translationMissing
Go now, mortal, but I'll be watching you!~|~translationMissing
You mean a sacrifice?~|~translationMissing
You mean a sacrifice? Are you some kind of god?~|~translationMissing
I am the guardian of the mountain, the god of the northern lands. I move the earth and control the skies. I am the Kendal!~|~translationMissing
I seek your advice, oh great one!~|~translationMissing
I seek your advice, oh great one.~|~translationMissing
I seek the cowardly murderer of a young lady of a nearby clan of mountain people. Do you know where I can find this person?~|~translationMissing
I am not here to answer questions of such trivial nature! Go now before doom befalls you, mortal!~|~translationMissing
You look like you escaped from a fairground!~|~translationMissing
I would not say such things if I were you, mortal!~|~translationMissing
You look like a man in a bearsuit!~|~translationMissing
What did you say, mortal?~|~translationMissing
I said, you look like a man wearing a bearsuit!~|~translationMissing
How did you figure that out? How did you know?~|~translationMissing
I just said you looked like a man wearing a bearsuit, I didn't know you were!~|~translationMissing
Conversation will resume from here if aborted~|~translationMissing
So what are you doing here, pretending to be a god?~|~translationMissing
Ah, the people that live in the mountains here, they are a superstitious lot. They fear few things, but magic and gods they're scared to death of.~|~translationMissing
So I took on the guise of one of their legends. It's a good way of being left alone.~|~translationMissing
And do you leave them alone as well?~|~translationMissing
Ah, you're referring to the skeletons you see here? Yes, I did. Most of the time, at least. When there was no troll to be ambushed, and I had to eat...~|~translationMissing
Did you kill a young lady, by the lake? Just recently?~|~translationMissing
Recently? Oh no, the entrance you came through has been blocked off for a good many years now. I've only seen trolls and the occasional stray dwarf since then, until you came along.~|~translationMissing
But yes, more than ten years ago, I did kill someone like that.~|~translationMissing
Oh, never mind then, that can't be right.~|~translationMissing
Oh, never mind then, that can't be the person I'm looking for. I'll be off.~|~translationMissing
Can I see that corpse?~|~translationMissing
Can I see that corpse? I'd like to make sure of something.~|~translationMissing
She is just over there, in the centre, with the dress. I did not eat her after I killed her, she was too beautiful for that.~|~translationMissing
I felt sorry for killing her, but by then it was already too late.~|~translationMissing
Yes, she does match the description I was given, it is her after all!~|~translationMissing
Hand the body over to me!~|~translationMissing
I demand that you hand the body over to me! I must return them to her father!~|~translationMissing
You demand nothing! You may have uncovered my disguise, but my claws can still tear you apart at will!~|~translationMissing
I will not allow you to leave!~|~translationMissing
The Kendal attacks the player~|~translationMissing
I humbly request to be given the remains.~|~translationMissing
I humbly request to be given the remains, so I can return them to her father.~|~translationMissing
I cannot do that. If they knew I wasn't a god, and if her father knew I killed his daughter, the whole tribe would come in here at once and I'd be finished.~|~translationMissing
I will kill you myself!~|~translationMissing
Come and try!~|~translationMissing
Never mind then, I'd better leave~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I can't allow you to leave either. You cannot tell anyone about me.~|~translationMissing
I think you're completely mad!~|~translationMissing
I think you're completely mad, walking around in your silly bearsuit, killing innocent people!~|~translationMissing
And how is that very much different from you, walking around in silly suits of armour, killing everything that moves?~|~translationMissing
It's me, of whom many legends are sung.~|~translationMissing
It's [player name], of whom many legends are sung.~|~translationMissing
You are brave, to come into my cave and say a thing like that!~|~translationMissing
Slumber? You didn't seem to be sleeping.~|~translationMissing
Do not mock me, mortal!~|~translationMissing
You collect the helmet from the corpse of the 'bear' as a trophy.~|~translationMissing
This must be someone else's corpse, you already have Asleif's corpse.~|~translationMissing
You'd better bring this back to the chieftain instead.~|~translationMissing
You welcome the fresh air.~|~translationMissing
I found the man who murdered Asleif! He was in a cave just by the pool, but I killed him!~|~translationMissing
Do not say such things, outerlander! She is not dead, merely missing.~|~translationMissing
She'll show up again... yes, yes, I'm sure of it.~|~translationMissing
But she's been missing for more than ten years!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I know... well, that doesn't mean she can't still come back, right?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the corpse~|~translationMissing
Er, yeah, right... sure.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the corpse~|~translationMissing
Look, here, I even have her corpse!~|~translationMissing
I do not want to see any of the corpses you're carrying around with you! Begone!~|~translationMissing
I found him! I found your murderer! It was some bear-like man who called himself the Kendal.~|~translationMissing
'The Kendal is an ancient spirit of our people, but he is benevolent. Are you sure of this?'~|~translationMissing
Well, it was actually a guy in a bearsuit. But he's dead now.~|~translationMissing
'Go then, to my father, and show him what you've learned.'~|~translationMissing
Do you know there is a strange bear like thing in a cave near the pool?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is the Kendal.~|~translationMissing
Only the cave is hidden behind some trees, you se- What, you mean you know that already?~|~translationMissing
Of course. We planted the trees there ourselves many years ago. It is unwise to come too close to a god, so we made sure no one would go there anymore.~|~translationMissing
But he's not a god!~|~translationMissing
But he killed your daughter!~|~translationMissing
And why didn't you tell me your daughter's been missing for years?~|~translationMissing
But but but... He's not a god! He's a man in a bearsuit! And he killed your daughter! And why didn't you tell me she's been missing for more than ten years?~|~translationMissing
Fourteen years, to be exact. And I didn't say otherwise, did I? As for the Kendal, what proof have you of these serious accusations?~|~translationMissing
Well... I've only gone and killed him, haven't I?~|~translationMissing
You have? Then we made an enormous mistake. As did he. Impersonating a god bears the highest penalty imaginable, but I did not think that kind of justice would be delivered by the hand of an outerlander.~|~translationMissing
I also found your daughter. The bearman killed her.~|~translationMissing
So it is true then, after all? Let me see her body please.~|~translationMissing
I didn't bring it with me, I'll go and look for it.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I see it is her. So it is also true that you spoke to her spirit at the pool?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's true.~|~translationMissing
Then she must be buried there, on the island at the center of the pool... to bring peace to her spirit. This is a most unusual situation, but will you bury her, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I will.~|~translationMissing
Then please listen closely. If she is given a proper burial, she is to be buried with some of her possessions. I see she's still wearing her dress, so you will need one more item. When she has been buried, you must build a cairn on top. It is our tradition to build these cairns in the shape of our longboats that we use when we need to cross the seas. You can use rocks for this purpose, about five or so should be enough. Only then are the burial rites complete.~|~translationMissing
So I need to bury her with one of her possessions, and build a cairn on top made out of rocks. So where do I get another one of her possessions?~|~translationMissing
Asleif had little possessions in life and none that have survived the years. I do not know where you might find such a thing, but perhaps Ragnar does, out by the pool.~|~translationMissing
I won't.~|~translationMissing
I... ehm...~|~translationMissing
Errr...~|~translationMissing
I killed the bearman! He really was just a man after all, like I said!~|~translationMissing
You have? Then we made an enormous mistake.~|~translationMissing
As did he. Impersonating a god bears the highest penalty imaginable, but I did not think that kind of justice would be delivered by the hand of an outerlander.~|~translationMissing
I heard the news from Hamal, outerlander. Alas, I have known this had to be so for a long time, but Hamal just didn't want to listen.~|~translationMissing
Uh huh. Well, Hamal asked me to bury her with some of her possessions. But he doesn't have any anymore. Do you have anything that may help?~|~translationMissing
I'm not altogether sure... I do have one thing that may be appropriate. I was going to give her a necklace, when we were supposed to meet here many years ago. I still have it, and since it was a gift for Asleif, technically it's hers. Take it, outerlander, and bury it with her. It will be my parting gift.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Asleif's necklace.)~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I will make sure she's given a proper burial now.~|~translationMissing
You've been waiting to give it to her all that time?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes... she is my only love, you see, and will be so forever.~|~translationMissing
But that's ridiculous! Don't you ever go out and have some fun? What is wrong with you people!~|~translationMissing
I do not expect you to understand such things. But perhaps you will find your own love one day, and then you will remember these words.~|~translationMissing
You dig a hole in the ground, then carefully lay down the skeleton of the chieftain's daughter, together with her necklace. You then close the hole, creating a small burial mound. Now all you need to do is build a cairn on top.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have enough muddy rocks~|~translationMissing

If the player has enough muddy rocks~|~translationMissing
You think you can hear a soft 'thank you' as the singing quietens down.~|~translationMissing
You are a most unusual outerlander. The council of Rellekka was wise to make you an honourary Fremennik.~|~translationMissing
You have my thanks, in any case.~|~translationMissing
So what are you all going to do now? Are you finally going to move to another location?~|~translationMissing
No, I've decided to set up a permanent camp here.~|~translationMissing
There is no need to move now with our new supply of food. Also, there is a protective spirit looking after us now.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Well, I must be off again.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What exactly happened to your daughter?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I thought you didn't believe in magic?~|~translationMissing

Arianwyn~|~translationMissing
Ah [player name], glad to see you made it. Welcome to Lletya, home to the Elven Resistance.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. It wasn't particularly easy to get here, it took some work to convince Islwyn I could be trusted.~|~translationMissing
That's not surprising, he is not particularly fond of humans. But if you've earnt his trust, it proves to me that I was right to take a chance on you.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you did. I hate the thought that I might still be blindly working for King Lathas and Lord Iorwerth right now.~|~translationMissing
Well you're here now and you still have a chance to right your previous wrongs.~|~translationMissing
I hope so. There's a lot I still don't understand though. Why are King Lathas and Lord Iorwerth working together? Where does the plague fit in?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that a lot is still unknown to us as well. However, I will explain what I can. Be aware that this is only a brief overview. You'll find some books around the village that explain more if you wish though.~|~translationMissing
Okay, let's begin~|~translationMissing
Many years ago, all elves lived in harmony within the crystal city of Prifddinas alongside our goddess, Seren. When the God Wars ended, Seren was lost to us. For the first time, we were alone. To lead us through those difficult times, Baxtorian Cadarn was named trhe first king of the elves. Under Baxtorian, our kingdom expanded into the east. We prospered for a time, but little did we know that an enemy walked among us. During that time, Lord Iorwerth turned away from Seren and pledged himself to Zamorak, the Dark Lord. A larger kingdom meant our forces were further spread. Lord Iorwerth took advantage of that. He claimed Prifddinas as his own. Baxtorian tried to take it back from him, but Prifddinas was built to survive the God Wars. There was no way to retake it. In a last attempt to keep the city safe, Baxtorian and the clan elders sung the song of inversion which reverted the entire city into a crystal seed.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so that explains why the city just looks like an empty field.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. After that, Baxtorian returned to the east but found that the rest of the kingdom had fallen while he was away. Not only that, but his wife, Glarial, had been taken.~|~translationMissing
I know this bit, Baxtorian retreated into his home beneath the waterfall and never came out. I moved Glarial's remains into the waterfall so they could be together.~|~translationMissing
That's good to hear, I can see why you managed to earn Islwyn's trust. Anyway, with Baxtorian gone and Prifddinas lost, our land erupted into a Civil War. We've been fighting ever since.~|~translationMissing
I see, it's good to have a bit more understanding. But where does King Lathas come into this?~|~translationMissing
That is the bit we're not so sure on. We know little about the lands to the east. From what we can tell, it seems that Lord Iorwerth has promised to support King Lathas in reclaiming some land his family once owned.~|~translationMissing
But why? What's in it for Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
That's what we want you to find out. According to our spies, Lord Iorwerth has used the alliance with King Lathas as an opportunity to infiltrate West Ardougne. The city must contain something he needs.~|~translationMissing
Infiltrate? How?~|~translationMissing
Those that you know as mourners are in fact elves in service to Lord Iorwerth. We regularly see them crossing the Arandar mountain pass and into the east.~|~translationMissing
Mourners are elves?~|~translationMissing
That they are. We assume that the plague is a cover up for them to enter the city unchallenged. We don't know why though. That's why we need you. You know the city and can frely travel there. You are the perfect person for this task. We need you to go to West Ardougne, infiltrate the mourners and find out what they are doing in the city.~|~translationMissing
Let's skip the backstory.~|~translationMissing
So you want me to infiltrate the mourners? How am I supposed to achieve that?~|~translationMissing
I don't have an exact plan for you I'm afraid. You know the city better than any of us so are best placed to make a plan yourself. However as I said before, there have been sightings of mourners crossing the Arandar mountain pass. I'm sure you can take advantage of that.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
This will cut down you to size!~|~translationMissing
Do you know any way to remove blood stains?~|~translationMissing
Blood stains is it... Well, the soap I use can clean almost any stain.~|~translationMissing
Really?!? That sounds like just the thing I need, can I use some?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have very much soap left and I still have lots to get clean.~|~translationMissing
Alright can you tell me where I can buy some?~|~translationMissing
You can't... I make it to my own secret recipe.~|~translationMissing
If Eadgar's Ruse has not been started~|~translationMissing
If Eadgar's Ruse has been completed~|~translationMissing
Could you be less helpful?~|~translationMissing
Like you were, taking those robes from my washing line?? So yes, if you know a way I can be less helpful just tell me. I'll try it.~|~translationMissing
You search the laundry basket... It's full of dirty robes, On top you see a bar of soap.~|~translationMissing
Steal the soap.~|~translationMissing
If the inventory is full~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough room to take the soap.~|~translationMissing
You wait until Tegid is looking the other way... and steal the soap!~|~translationMissing
Leave the soap.~|~translationMissing
You leave the soap where it is.~|~translationMissing
You give the top a good scrub with the soap and rinse away the bloody suds with water.~|~translationMissing
Oronwen~|~translationMissing
Hello, can I help?~|~translationMissing
Do you mend clothes?~|~translationMissing
I do, but human clothes are too hard to med. They do not have the finesse of Elven garments.~|~translationMissing
I need you to repair some Elven clothing as it goes.~|~translationMissing
Let me take a look at it then.~|~translationMissing
You show the seamstress the Mourner trousers.~|~translationMissing
There's something disturbingly familiar about the design of these trousers, they are made for an Elf.~|~translationMissing
But can you fix them?~|~translationMissing
Of course I can, but I will need 2 pieces of silk and some bear fur.~|~translationMissing
There are still a few things I need before I can mend your trousers. Let me see... I need bear fur and two sheets of silk.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all the items~|~translationMissing
Great, I have everything here.~|~translationMissing
I have all I need to mend your trousers, hand them over and I will get started right away.~|~translationMissing
I have your trousers ready.~|~translationMissing
Oronwen hands you the Mourner trousers, they look as good as new.~|~translationMissing
Any time.~|~translationMissing
I killed one of those mourners crossing the mountain pass and took their clothes.~|~translationMissing
Ah, a disguise. Good thinking. Use it to enter the Mourner Headquarters in West Ardougne. Once your in, see if you can find out what they are doing in the city.~|~translationMissing
It is good to see so many new recruits, soon no one will be able to stand against the power of the Death Guard.~|~translationMissing
That sounds... err great.~|~translationMissing
Indeed it is. You should speak with Essyllt downstairs. He's in charge.~|~translationMissing
Good day. Are you in need of assistance?~|~translationMissing
Are the townspeople causing you trouble?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but I don't think you can help~|~translationMissing
You will be surprised at how much help the brute force of the Guard can be.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll be sure to ask if I'm in need of some muscle.~|~translationMissing
No, I just wanted to talk to a friendly face.~|~translationMissing
Do I look friendly to you? I really must work on my scowl more.~|~translationMissing
Hello, I'm...~|~translationMissing
Essyllt~|~translationMissing
Ah... I take it you are one of the new recruits?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm...~|~translationMissing
I'm Essyllt and I'm in charge here. Now come on, let us have a look at your paper work.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the letter of recommendation.~|~translationMissing
This seems to be all in order. Welcome to the Death Guard. Now, for your first assignment... As you may know, part of what we do here is keep the people believing in the plague...~|~translationMissing
Did they not tell you? Hmm... I'd better fill you in. Well as you undoubtedly know, we were sent here by Lord Iorwerth to secure the city. The reason for this is so that we can access the caves below...~|~translationMissing
What's important about the caves?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that information is classified until you prove your commitment to the Death Guard.~|~translationMissing
Oh, fair enough.~|~translationMissing
Now to keep our presence in the city secret, Lord Iorwerth arranged an alliance with King Lathas, the ruler in the east. Apparently the fool thinks we will help him dispose of the Knights of Camelot once our work here is done. I expect he'll be disappointed. Anyway, the plague serves two purposes. First, it allows us to move around the city in secret thanks to our mourner disguises. Second, it means we can abduct citizens to mine the caves below with ease. We just pretend they've fallen victim to the plague.~|~translationMissing
Doesn't anyone suspect the truth?~|~translationMissing
Well we have had a few near misses. Recently we had some girl from East Ardougne poking around asking too many questions, so we locked her up while we decided what to do with her. Annoyingly, she managed to escape with the help of some adventurer. Lucky for us, they were so stupid that we managed to use the adventurer to deal with King Tyras. It all worked out quite well in the end. Things like that is why we must ensure the people keep believing in the plague though. Once of the things we do to keep up the lie is to fool old Farmer Brumty into believing his sheep are infected. The old halfwit thinks just because his sheep are an abnormal colour, that they are all ill with plague. It's amazing what a bit of dye can do.~|~translationMissing
You dyed them?~|~translationMissing
Well you don't think they end up those ridiculous colours naturally do you? Anyway, shame of it is that we have yet to find a way to stop the dye from washing out. So we need someone, that someone being you, to go and re-dye them.~|~translationMissing
Simple enough, you want me to give a blue rinse to a load of old sheep?~|~translationMissing
Not quite, for starters the sheep need to be dyed red, yellow, green and blue. But most important is that you are not seen doing this by anyone. Also you will need to re-dye them the colours they already are or the farmer may notice the change.~|~translationMissing
That sounds a little more tricky. How did you do it before?~|~translationMissing
We have a gnomic device that fires fat dye parcels that rupture on impact. Unfortunately, we have run out of the parcels and the device is broken.~|~translationMissing
Can I take a look at it?~|~translationMissing
Sure. We have a gnome inventor here too. Sadly, he is not being very helpful about fixing it, but you can talk to him if you like. Here is the key, he is in the next room. And here's the device as well.~|~translationMissing
Essyllt hands you a strange object and a tarnished key.~|~translationMissing
Hello, will you help me fix this... err... thing?~|~translationMissing
Gnome on a rack~|~translationMissing
I'm not helping you fix that, as if it hasn't caused enough trouble as it is. Your friends have already tried every torture in the book! I'm still not telling anyone squat.~|~translationMissing
Have they tried... err... Stretching your eyelids yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it didn't work.~|~translationMissing
How about... feeding you nail and prune stew?~|~translationMissing
That's all I've been living on since I got here.~|~translationMissing
Set fire to your nostril hair? Let rabid rabbits nibble your toes? Given you a twisted arm??~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes and yes. Tried them all, quite liked the toe nibbling.~|~translationMissing
Extracted your wisdom teeth?~|~translationMissing
Us gnomes aren't wise so we don't get them. Face it, you'll never put me in enough pain that I'll tell you what you wanna know. I used to play gnomeball as a kid. This is a walk in the park in comparison.~|~translationMissing
Alright I get the picture. What will work then?~|~translationMissing
Ha! You think I'm stupid enough to tell you that I've been craving toad crunchies or that I can't stand having my feet tickled!~|~translationMissing
Err... But you just told me?!?~|~translationMissing
I did? What did I say?~|~translationMissing
You said about going to the park and playing gnomeball.~|~translationMissing
Yes yes!! That was it, I'd hate that. Please don't do that. By Guthix's beard you mourners are such idiots! Leave me be moron.~|~translationMissing
You said about toad crunchies and a gnome ball.~|~translationMissing
I used to play gnomeball yes.... what's that got to do with anything? Nothing that can convince me to help you that's for sure. Go away imbecile.~|~translationMissing
You said about toad crunchies and being tickled.~|~translationMissing
Oops... I mean erm... No that must have been some other err... gnome...~|~translationMissing
You're not fooling me... So you'll help me in exchange for toad crunchies?~|~translationMissing
If you think you can just buy my co-operation you're a bigger imbecile than I thought.~|~translationMissing
You will tell me, sooner or later.~|~translationMissing
You said about being tickled and a gnome ball.~|~translationMissing
Oooh... a big scary gnomeball. I mean, it might crush me and my entire family, because we're so small!! They have big teeth and everything don't they? Sheesh. You mourners will have to try better than that. Now go away. I need some sleep after all these *yawn* scary threats.~|~translationMissing
You said about being tickled and going to the park.~|~translationMissing
No... I said being here is a walk in the park. Where do they get you guys? You must all be Ogre rejects for being too thick. Leave me be idiot.~|~translationMissing
You dangle the toad crunchies above the gnome's nose just out of reach and hold the feather menacingly close to his feet.~|~translationMissing
Now will you help me or would you prefer it if I tickle your feet?~|~translationMissing
Alright... alright! I'm beaten! Bring me some soft leather and some magic logs and I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
I have all of that here.~|~translationMissing
Well let me up off of this rack and I'll get started, I can't do anything while I'm all tied up.~|~translationMissing
Now will you help me or do I have to tickle your feet some more?~|~translationMissing
I told you, I'm not going to get anything out of helping you, am I? As I figure, that device is the only thing keeping me out of the slave pens, where I'd get fed worse than nail and prune stew!~|~translationMissing
Oi! There's no need for that, I already agreed to help.~|~translationMissing
That's all well and good but I'm enjoying doing it.~|~translationMissing
You tickle the gnome's feet...~|~translationMissing
Ho ho ho... no more... Teehee... please stop... Hoohoo... he he he... I hate you!~|~translationMissing
What do you think you are doing? You are meant to be getting information out of him, not making friends!~|~translationMissing
I need to let him up if he's to fix this advice.~|~translationMissing
Okay, but without the proper paperwork he stays in this room.~|~translationMissing
You release the gnome and hand him the magic logs, soft leather and the strange device along with some toad crunchies.~|~translationMissing
Right, here you go. Now leave me to eat my crunchies in peace.~|~translationMissing
The gnome gives you a fixed device.~|~translationMissing
What are you after now?~|~translationMissing
Do you know where I can get the dye parcels for his thing?~|~translationMissing
You mourners are really not very good at this are you? Fine, since you gave me some crunchies, the parcels are actually toads.~|~translationMissing
Toads?~|~translationMissing
Yes, toads. Get some bellows and fill them with the dye you want. Then just find a toad and use the bellows to fill it up.~|~translationMissing
Poor toads.~|~translationMissing
Ahh they're fine, a bit of dye never hurt anything... It's the firing them out the device that kills them.~|~translationMissing
Ewww... That's nasty.~|~translationMissing
Oh and torturing gnomes is perfectly fine? Hypocrite.~|~translationMissing
You make a fair point. Where do I find the toads?~|~translationMissing
You get loads of them down in the Feldip Hills, especially near the ponds.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I've used them to catch chompy birds before. I have some bellows right here as well.~|~translationMissing
Catching chompy birds? You mourners are weird. Anyway, if you don't need anything else I'd like to be left in peace.~|~translationMissing
Could you remind me where I can get the dye parcels for this thing?~|~translationMissing
How forgetful are you? et some bellows and fill them with the dye you want. Then just head down to the Feldip Hills, find a toad and use the bellows to fill it up.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the reminder. I have some bellows right here that I can use.~|~translationMissing
Well if you don't need anything else I'd like to be left in peace.~|~translationMissing
How dare you enter my house, Mourner! Get out!~|~translationMissing
Elena, it's me... [player name].~|~translationMissing
[player name]? I didn't recogonise you in all that Mourner gear!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.~|~translationMissing
I worry about what you've got yourself involved in. You be careful out there.~|~translationMissing
I'll look after myself Elena. I promise.~|~translationMissing
You'd better. Let me know as soon as you work out what's going on.~|~translationMissing
How goes it [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Alright, I've managed to infiltrate the mourners. I just have to find out what they are up to now.~|~translationMissing
Great work! Stick with it [player name].~|~translationMissing
Have you finished with those sheep yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is done. What next?~|~translationMissing
It is good to see your enthusiasm. I was going to get one of the others to do this job, but as you are here... It has been quite some time since anyone got ill form the plague, so I would like you to see to it that people do!~|~translationMissing
Err... But the plague doesn't exist, how am I meant to do that?!?!~|~translationMissing
We have never tried this before, but some joker put something in our food not too long ago that gave us all symptoms akin to those of the plague. If you can find out what it was that we were poisoned with, you could reproduce the effects. If done right the poison should not be fatal and could help restock our dwindling supply of cheap labour. We can have our men remove the 'infected' citizens and sent into the mines. Distribution should be easy enough. Because of the city walls no one can grow their own food. Instead, all the food here comes from one of three supply points.~|~translationMissing
Let me get this clear, you want me to find out who poisoned you, find out what they poisoned you with, find out how to make the poison and produce enough poison to affect a lot of people?~|~translationMissing
Don't forget the part where you use the poison to contaminate the food supply. Two of the three supply points should be enough.~|~translationMissing
How am I meant to do all of that?~|~translationMissing
You seem resourceful so I'm sure you will come up with something. I would help you but I am not a biologist.~|~translationMissing
Luckily for me I know a biologist nearby.~|~translationMissing
Someone trustworthy I hope?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, definitely.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Perform this task and then return to me.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Elena.~|~translationMissing
[player name]! How's it going? Have you found out any more about the plague?~|~translationMissing
As it goes, yes I have. It's a long story.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm not going anywhere. What's going on?~|~translationMissing
Well I'll start from when we found out that the plague was a hoax. When I confronted the king, he told me that he faked the plague to keep people safe from his brother, King Tyras. He said that Tyras was taken by the Dark Lord while exploring the lands to the west. He claimed that the Dark Lord corrupted him by forcing him to drink from the Chalice of Eternity.~|~translationMissing
But that was a lie?~|~translationMissing
Indeed, but I didn't find out until much later. On the kings orders, I travelled through the Underground Pass and into the western lands of Tirannwn. Once there, I met up with Lord Iorwerth, the leader of some elves that had allied with the king. He helped me kill King Tyras. That was when I discovered the truth. While returning to King Lathas, I was confronted by another elf named Arianwyn, the leader of a group of rebel elves opposing Lord Iorwerth. At the time, I was carrying a letter from Lord Iorwerth to King Lathas. Arianwyn magically broke the seal on the letter so I could read it.~|~translationMissing
It revealed that it's actually King Lathas and Lord Iorwerth who serve the Dark Lord. According to the letter, King Lathas wants to reclaim Camelot from King Arthur and believes the Dark Lord can help him.~|~translationMissing
And Lord Iorwerth?~|~translationMissing
I'm not exactly sure yet. West Ardougne seems to be key to his plans though. I met with Arianwyn who revealed to me that the mourners are actually elves in service to Lord Iorwerth. I've infiltrated the mourners and I'm trying to work out what they are doing. From what I've learnt so far, there's something important to them in the caves below West Ardougne. I'm currently working with them to earn their trust. Hopefully they'll reveal their plans to me soon.~|~translationMissing
I see, that's quite the reveal. If you need anything from me just ask.~|~translationMissing
Well, I was hoping you could help me with something.~|~translationMissing
I've been asked to produce a poison based on rotten apples.~|~translationMissing
I doubt any poison based solely on apples, rotten or not, would be very effective.~|~translationMissing
Well I put a rotten apple in the Mourners' stew, I'm told that the effect was much like the symptoms of the plague.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... That sounds like they were ill from some sort of toxin, I should think it was a mould of some sort that had the effect, not the rotten apple itself. What do you need it for?~|~translationMissing
I need to poison a large food supply in order to get the Mourners' trust.~|~translationMissing
That's awful, I can't help you with that.~|~translationMissing
If I don't gain the trust of the Mourners, then the people of West Ardougne will have a much worse time than the effects of that toxin. Elena trust me.~|~translationMissing
You'd better be right about this, and I'd better make sure you get this toxin right so no one dies! Bring me a sample of rotten apple to examine. I'll also see if I can make a counteractant for the toxin.~|~translationMissing
Without a rotten apple in the inventory~|~translationMissing
Alright I'll be back shortly with a rotten apple for you.~|~translationMissing
With a rotten apple in the inventory~|~translationMissing
I have one right here.~|~translationMissing
I'm back.~|~translationMissing
You have a sample of rotten apple for me?~|~translationMissing
No, I forgot to get one.~|~translationMissing
Well if you bring me one we can get started on this toxin.~|~translationMissing
Is that you [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Yes it's me.~|~translationMissing
Yes I have it right here.~|~translationMissing
You hand Elena the rotten apple.}~|~translationMissing
Ick... Alright then let's get started.~|~translationMissing
Elena starts some tests on the apple.}~|~translationMissing
Right... lets see... Okay, I've managed to isolate a small sample of the toxin. It's a byproduct of the mould that grows on these appes. It's not fatal so a counteractant shouldn't be necessary. How big is the store that you're going to affect?~|~translationMissing
Well I was instructed to contaminate the two of the three supply points in West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
That's over half of the food in the city! You're going to need a huge amount of the toxin to do that. You're also going to need to refine it too, or people will notice rotten apples amongst the food.~|~translationMissing
This is starting to sound a little tricky, can't you make it for me?~|~translationMissing
I would, but I don't have the right equipment here to do anything in bulk.~|~translationMissing
Alight then, tell me the process and I'll get started.~|~translationMissing
Right then, the first thing to do is mash up a lot of rotten apples, then you will need to dissolve the toxin into a liquid that has a very low evaporation point, some form of solvent. I don't know as much about those kinds of chemicals but I believe naphtha will be perfect for this.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I've worked with naphtha before. The chemist in Rimmington helped me making it from coal tar.~|~translationMissing
Perfect. Well get yourself some naphtha and some mashed rotten apples and mix them together. Once you've done that, strain out any solids. Finally, heat the mixture to evaporate off the solvent. Be careful of naked flames as the solvent will be highly flammable.~|~translationMissing
And that's all is it? Why isn't anything ever easy?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I never said it would be simple. Here, you'll need to strain out the solids.~|~translationMissing
Elena hands you a large sieve.~|~translationMissing
You may want to check out the orchard just north of the city. I hear no one has tended it since the blight infected the trees there. I imagine it will have plenty of rotten apples.~|~translationMissing
Hey Elena.~|~translationMissing
Huh? Oh hello. I just can't get used to a friend being dressed as mourner.~|~translationMissing
So how's the poisoning going?~|~translationMissing
Not too well, can you remind me how I should make it again?~|~translationMissing
Right, the first thing to do is mash up a lot of rotten apples. You'll probably be able to do that at the orchard just north of the city. I hear no one has tended it since the blight infected the trees there. Next, you'll want to get yourself some naphtha and mix it with the rotten apples. You mentioned the chemist in Rimmingon helped you with naphtha before. You might want to speak to him again. Once that's done, use the sieve I gave you to strain out any solids. Finally, heat the mixture to evaporate off the solvent. Be careful of naked flames as the solvent will be highly flammable.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks Elena.~|~translationMissing
You sieve the solids out of the mixture.~|~translationMissing
You evaporate the naphtha and you're left with a powdery residue on the insides of the barrel.~|~translationMissing
You add the toxin to the grain, after a few seconds of mixing you can't tell the difference.~|~translationMissing
So have you found out what those mourner are up to yet?~|~translationMissing
I was just on my way back there.~|~translationMissing
Well let me know when you find out.~|~translationMissing
Nothing I'm just talking to people randomly in case it helps.~|~translationMissing
Does it?~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should give me more toad crunchies. Ask any gnome, 'toad should be in everything' they'll tell you, mark my words.~|~translationMissing
Thanks... Toads always hit the spot!~|~translationMissing
I got no need for that, keep it.~|~translationMissing
You are back already? How is the epidemic going?~|~translationMissing
The epidemic? Oh, you mean the poisoning?~|~translationMissing
Subtle as a brick... Yes that, how is it going?~|~translationMissing
This is good news, give it a few days and the slave pens will be full again.~|~translationMissing
So have I proved my commitment now?~|~translationMissing
Yes I think you have. I guess you want to know what we're doing in the mines?~|~translationMissing
A long time ago, Seren herself ordered the construction of a great temple deep beneath the earth. This temple guards a great power, one that is key to our plans. We believe the temple lies beneath this city. That is why we are here. Unfortunately, progress has been slower than we'd have liked. The slaves accidently mined into some old caverns infested with beasts. They have caused us significant issues.~|~translationMissing
I see. But how close are we to finding it??~|~translationMissing
It shouldn't be long now. We have started to see signs that we are near. Anyway, now that you know about the temple, I have a new task for you to perform, deep within the mines. Alas, one of the guards has taken the key to the mines to be copied. Report in regularly and I will see that you get a copy as soon as he gets back.~|~translationMissing
Now be on your way, I have other things to attend to.~|~translationMissing
I should probably report this to Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
Oh nothing.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the key to the mines yet?~|~translationMissing
No, the guard is being a bit slow, but we should have it soon.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll report in again later.~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name]. Have you found out what those mourners are up to yet?~|~translationMissing
Apparently they are trying to find an old temple deep under the city. That's what their mining operation is for. The temple seems to be the key to their plans. It apparently holds a great power. I still have no idea what that is yet though.~|~translationMissing
I think I have the information you're after. It seems Iorwerth elves are searching for an ancient temple of some sort deep beneath West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
Temple? That must be the Temple of Light!~|~translationMissing
Temple of Light? What's the Temple of Light?~|~translationMissing
It was built by Seren herself to guard a dark and ancient power. This is not good friend, I fear Lord Iorwerth intends to use that power to summon the Dark Lord!~|~translationMissing
I don't think they've found this temple yet, but they know it's down there.~|~translationMissing
Well then we still have time. Thank you for your help so far, we would never have discovered this without you. Now we must prepare for what comes next.~|~translationMissing
So what are we going to do about the Temple of Light?~|~translationMissing
First of all, we need to know how close the Iorwerth elves are to finding it. Do you think you are ready for this?~|~translationMissing
It is recommended to have an Agility level of at least 60 before starting the Mourning's End Part II quest.~|~translationMissing
I don't think I am.~|~translationMissing
Well don't take too long. Every second we waste is a big risk.~|~translationMissing

Hobbes~|~translationMissing
This is private property! Please leave!~|~translationMissing
He is ignoring you.~|~translationMissing
She is ignoring you.~|~translationMissing
Louisa~|~translationMissing
I'm far too upset to talk to random people right now.~|~translationMissing
Donovan the Family Handyman~|~translationMissing
I have no interest in talking to gawkers.~|~translationMissing
Pierre~|~translationMissing
The guards told me not to talk to anyone.~|~translationMissing
Stanford~|~translationMissing
Have you no shame? We are all grieving at the moment.~|~translationMissing
I need the guards' permission to do that.~|~translationMissing
You need the guards' permission to do that.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's terrible! Lord Sinclair has been murdered and we don't have any clues as to who or why. We're totally baffled!~|~translationMissing
If you can help us we will be very grateful.~|~translationMissing
Start the Murder Mystery quest?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I'll help!~|~translationMissing
Thanks a lot!~|~translationMissing
What should I be doing to help?~|~translationMissing
Look around and investigate who might be responsible. The Sarge said every murder leaves clues to who done it, but frankly we're out of our depth here.~|~translationMissing
You should do your own dirty work.~|~translationMissing
Get lost then, this is private property! ...Unless you'd like to be taken in for questioning yourself?~|~translationMissing
What should I be doing to help again?~|~translationMissing
How did Lord Sinclair die?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's all very mysterious. Mary, the maid, found the body in the study next to his bedroom on the east wing of the ground floor.~|~translationMissing
The door was found locked from the inside, and he seemed to have been stabbed, but there was an odd smell in the room. Frankly, I'm stumped.~|~translationMissing
I know who did it!~|~translationMissing
Really? That was quick work! Who?~|~translationMissing
It was an intruder!~|~translationMissing
That's what we were thinking too. That someone broke in to steal something, was discovered by Lord Sinclair, stabbed him and ran.~|~translationMissing
It's odd that apparently nothing was stolen though... Find out something has been stolen,~|~translationMissing
and the case is closed, but the murdered man was a friend of the King, and it's more than my job's worth not to investigate fully.~|~translationMissing
The butler did it!~|~translationMissing
I hope you have proof to that effect. We have to arrest someone for this and it seems to me that only the actual murderer would gain by falsely accusing someone.~|~translationMissing
Although having said that the butler is kind of shifty looking...~|~translationMissing
It was one of the servants!~|~translationMissing
Oh really? Which one?~|~translationMissing
It was one of the women...~|~translationMissing
It was one of the women[sic]~|~translationMissing
It was SO obviously Louisa the cook.~|~translationMissing
Great work. Show me the evidence, and we'll take them to the dungeons.~|~translationMissing
You DO have evidence of their crime, right?~|~translationMissing
Uh....~|~translationMissing
Tch. You wouldn't last a day in the guards with sloppy thinking like that. Come see me when you have some proof of your accusations.~|~translationMissing
It MUST have been Mary the maid.~|~translationMissing
It was one of the men...~|~translationMissing
It can ONLY be Donovan the handyman.~|~translationMissing
Pierre the dog handler. No question.~|~translationMissing
Hobbes the butler. The butler ALWAYS did it.~|~translationMissing
You MUST know it was Stanford The Gardener...~|~translationMissing
It was one of his family!~|~translationMissing
I KNOW it was Anna.~|~translationMissing
I am SO sure it was Carol.~|~translationMissing
I'll bet you ANYTHING it was Elizabeth.~|~translationMissing
I'm certain it was Bob.~|~translationMissing
It was David. No doubt about it.~|~translationMissing
If it wasn't Frank I'll eat my shoes!~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the criminal's dagger~|~translationMissing
I already have the murder weapon.~|~translationMissing
This knife doesn't seem sturdy enough to have killed Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the pungent pot~|~translationMissing
I already have the poisoned pot.~|~translationMissing
It seems like Lord Sinclair was drinking from this before he died.~|~translationMissing
Some thread seems to have been caught on a loose nail on the window.~|~translationMissing
You take the thread.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the thread~|~translationMissing
Lucky for you there's some thread left. You should be less careless in future.~|~translationMissing
If the player is still holding the thread~|~translationMissing
You have already taken the thread.~|~translationMissing
You don't want to damage evidence!~|~translationMissing
For blue thread~|~translationMissing
Some blue thread. Not enough to be worth taking.~|~translationMissing
For green thread~|~translationMissing
Some green thread. Not enough to be worth taking.~|~translationMissing
For red thread~|~translationMissing
Some red thread. Not enough to be worth taking.~|~translationMissing
It's a heap of compost.~|~translationMissing
It's a very old beehive.~|~translationMissing
It's the drains from the kitchen.~|~translationMissing
It looks like a spiders' nest of some kind...~|~translationMissing
A fountain with large numbers of insects around the base.~|~translationMissing
The Sinclair Family Crest is hung up here.~|~translationMissing
As you approach the gate the guard dog starts barking loudly at you. There is no way an intruder could have committed the murder. It must have been someone the dog knew to get past it quietly.~|~translationMissing
I'm here to help the guards with their investigation.~|~translationMissing
Anna~|~translationMissing
Oh really? What do you want to know then?~|~translationMissing
Who do you think was responsible?~|~translationMissing
It was clearly an intruder.~|~translationMissing
Well, I don't think it was.~|~translationMissing
It was one of our lazy servants then.~|~translationMissing
Where were you when the murder happened?~|~translationMissing
In the library. No one else was there so you'll just have to take my word for it.~|~translationMissing
Do you recognise this thread?~|~translationMissing
You show Anna the thread from the study.~|~translationMissing
Not really, no. Thread is fairly common.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I had better talk to you then.~|~translationMissing
I don't really care as long as no one thinks it's me. Maybe it was that strange poison seller who headed towards the seers village.~|~translationMissing
I was walking by myself in the garden.~|~translationMissing
And can anyone vouch for that?~|~translationMissing
No. But I was.~|~translationMissing
You show him the thread you discovered.~|~translationMissing
It's some thread. great[sic] clue. No, really.~|~translationMissing
Carol~|~translationMissing
Well, ask what you want to know then.~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I think it's very convenient that you have arrived here so soon after it happened. Maybe it was you.~|~translationMissing
Why? Are you accusing me of something? You seem to have a very high opinion of yourself I was in my room if you must know, alone.~|~translationMissing
You show Carol the thread found at the crime scene.~|~translationMissing
It's some thread. Sorry, do you have a point here? Or do you just enjoy wasting peoples time?~|~translationMissing
And? Make this quick, I have better things to do than be interrogated by halfwits all day.~|~translationMissing
I don't really know or care. Frankly, the old man deserved to die.~|~translationMissing
There was a suspicious red headed man who came to the house the other day selling poison now I think about it. Last I saw he was headed towards the tavern in the Seers village.~|~translationMissing
That is none of your business. Are we finished now, or are you just going to stand there irritating me with your idiotic questions all day?~|~translationMissing
You show him the thread you found on the study window~|~translationMissing
No. Can I go yet? Your face irritates me.~|~translationMissing
Elizabeth~|~translationMissing
What's so important you need to bother me with then?~|~translationMissing
Could have been anyone. The old man was an idiot. He's been asking for it for years.~|~translationMissing
I was out.~|~translationMissing
Care to be any more specific?~|~translationMissing
Not really. I don't have to justify myself to the likes of you, you know. I know the King personally you know. Now are we finished here?~|~translationMissing
You show her the thread from the study window.~|~translationMissing
It's some thread. You're not very good at this whole investigation thing are you?~|~translationMissing
Frank~|~translationMissing
Good for you. Now what do you want?~|~translationMissing
...And can you spare me any money? I'm a little short...~|~translationMissing
You don't know how long it takes an inheritance to come through do you? I could really use that money pretty soon...~|~translationMissing
I don't know, somewhere around here probably.~|~translationMissing
Could you spare me a few coins? I'll be able to pay you double tomorrow it's just there's this poker night tonight in town...~|~translationMissing
Frank examines the thread from the crime scene.~|~translationMissing
It looks like thread to me, but I'm not exactly an expert. Is it worth something? Can I have it? Actually, can you spare me a few gold?~|~translationMissing
Who do you think is responsible?~|~translationMissing
Oh... I really couldn't say. I wouldn't really want to point any fingers at anybody. If I had to make a guess I'd have to say it was probably Bob though.~|~translationMissing
I saw him arguing with Lord Sinclair about some missing silverware from the Kitchen. It was a very heated argument.~|~translationMissing
Where were you at the time of the murder?~|~translationMissing
Me? I was sound asleep here in the servants Quarters. It's very hard work as a handyman around here, There's always something to do!~|~translationMissing
Did you hear any suspicious noises at all?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm..... No, I didn't, but I sleep very soundly at night.~|~translationMissing
So you didn't hear any sounds of a struggle or any barking from the guard dog next to his study window?~|~translationMissing
Now you mention it, no. It is odd I didn't hear anything like that. But I do sleep very soundly as I said and wouldn't necessarily have heard it if there was any such noise.~|~translationMissing
I'm investigating the murder up at the Sinclair place.~|~translationMissing
Gossip~|~translationMissing
Murder is it? Well, I'm not really surprised...~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about the Sinclairs?~|~translationMissing
Well, what do you want to know?~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
Old Lord Sinclair was a great man with a lot of respect in these parts. More than his worthless children have anyway.~|~translationMissing
His children? They have something to gain by his death?~|~translationMissing
Yes. You could say that. Not that I'm one to gossip.~|~translationMissing
Why do the Sinclairs live so far from town?~|~translationMissing
Well, they used to live in the big castle, but old Lord Sinclair gave it up so that those strange knights could live there instead. So the king built him a new house to the North.~|~translationMissing
It's more cramped than his old place, but he seemed to like it. His children were furious at him for doing it though!~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about his sons?~|~translationMissing
His sons eh? They all have their own skeletons in their cupboards. You'll have to be more specific. Who are you interested in exactly?~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Bob.~|~translationMissing
Bob is an odd character indeed... I'm not one to gossip, but I heard Bob is addicted to Tea. He can't make~|~translationMissing
it through the day without having at least 20 cups!~|~translationMissing
You might not think that's such a big thing, but he has spent thousands of gold to feed his habit!~|~translationMissing
At one point he stole a lot of silverware from the kitchen and pawned it just so he could afford to buy his daily tea allowance.~|~translationMissing
If his father ever found out, he would be in so much trouble... he might even get disowned!~|~translationMissing
Tell me about David.~|~translationMissing
David... oh David... not many people know this, but David really has an anger problem. He's always screaming and shouting~|~translationMissing
at the household servants when he's angry, and they live in a state of fear, always walking on eggshells around him, but none of them have the courage~|~translationMissing
to talk to his father about his behaviour. If they did, Lord Sinclair would almost certainly~|~translationMissing
kick him out of the house, as some of the servants have been there longer than he has, and he definitely has no right to treat them like he does... but I'm not one to gossip about people.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Frank.~|~translationMissing
I'm not one to talk ill of people behind their back, but Frank is a real piece of work. He is an absolutely terrible gambler... he can't pass 2 dogs in the street without putting a bet on which one will bark first!~|~translationMissing
He has already squandered all of his allowance, and I heard he had stolen a number of paintings of his fathers to sell to try and cover his debts, but he still owes a lot of~|~translationMissing
people a lot of money. If his father ever found out, he would stop his income, and then he would be in serious trouble!~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about his daughters?~|~translationMissing
His daughters eh? They're all nasty pieces of work. which of them specifically did you want to know about?~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Anna.~|~translationMissing
Anna... ah yes... Anna has 2 great loves~|~translationMissing
Sewing and gardening. But one thing she has kept secret is that she once had an affair with Stanford the gardener, and tried to get him fired when they broke up,~|~translationMissing
by killing all of the flowers in the garden. If her father ever found out she had done that he would be so furious he would probably disown her.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Carol.~|~translationMissing
Oh Carol... she is such a fool. You didn't hear this from me, but I heard a while ago she was conned out of a lot of money by a travelling salesman who sold her a box full~|~translationMissing
of beans by telling her they were magic. But they weren't. She sold some rare books from the library to cover her debts, but~|~translationMissing
her father would be incredibly annoyed if he ever found out - he might even throw her out of the house!~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Elizabeth.~|~translationMissing
Elizabeth? Elizabeth has a strange problem... She cannot help herself, but is always stealing small objects - it's pretty sad that she is rich enough to afford to buy things, but would rather steal them instead.~|~translationMissing
Now, I don't want to spread stories, but I heard she even stole a silver needle from her father that had great sentimental value for him.~|~translationMissing
He was devastated when it was lost, and cried for a week thinking he had lost it!~|~translationMissing
If he ever found out that it was her who had stolen it he would go absolutely mental, maybe even disowning her!~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess it could have been an intruder, but with that big guard dog of theirs I seriously doubt it. I suspect it was someone closer to home...~|~translationMissing
Especially as I heard that the poison salesman in the Seers' village made a big sale to one of the family the other day.~|~translationMissing
I think the butler did it.~|~translationMissing
And I think you've been reading too many cheap detective novels. Hobbes is kind of uptight, but his loyalty to old Lord Sinclair is beyond question.~|~translationMissing
I am so confused about who did it.~|~translationMissing
I am so confused about who did it...~|~translationMissing
Think you could give me any hints?~|~translationMissing
Well, I don't know if it's related, but I heard from that Poison Salesman in town that he sold some poison to one of the Sinclair family~|~translationMissing
the other day. I don't think he has any stock left now though...~|~translationMissing
Well, in my considered opinion it must be David. The man is nothing more than a bully And I happen to know that poor Lord Sinclair and David had a massive argument in the living~|~translationMissing
room about the way he treats the staff, the other day. I did not intend to overhear their conversation, but they were shouting so loudly I could not help but Overhear it. David definitely used the words~|~translationMissing
'I am going to kill you!' as well. I think he should be the prime suspect. He has a nasty temper that one.~|~translationMissing
I was assisting the cook with the evening meal. I gave Mary His Lordships' dinner, and sent her to take it to him, then heard the scream as she found the body.~|~translationMissing
How do you mean 'suspicious'?~|~translationMissing
Any sounds of a struggle with Lord Sinclair?~|~translationMissing
No, I definitely didn't hear anything like that.~|~translationMissing
How about the guard dog barking at all?~|~translationMissing
You know, now you come to mention it I don't believe I did. I suppose that is Proof enough that it could not have been an intruder who is responsible.~|~translationMissing
Elizabeth.~|~translationMissing
Her father confronted her about her constant petty thieving, and was devestated to find she had stolen a silver needle which had meant a lot to him.~|~translationMissing
You could hear their argument from Lumbridge!~|~translationMissing
I was right here with Hobbes and Mary. You can't suspect me surely!~|~translationMissing
suspicious? what do you mean suspicious?~|~translationMissing
Any sounds of a struggle with an intruder for example?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm sure I don't recall any such thing.~|~translationMissing
How about the guard dog barking at an intruder?~|~translationMissing
No, I didn't. If you don't have anything else to ask can You go and leave me alone now? I have a lot of cooking to do for this evening.~|~translationMissing
Oh I don't know... Frank was acting kind of funny... After that big argument him and the Lord had the other day by the beehive... so~|~translationMissing
I guess maybe him... but it's really scary to think someone here might have been responsible. I actually hope it was a burglar...~|~translationMissing
I was with Hobbes and Louisa in the Kitchen helping to prepare Lord Sinclair's meal, and then when I took it to his study... I saw... oh, it was horrible... he was....~|~translationMissing
She seems to be on the verge of crying. You decide not to push her anymore for details.~|~translationMissing
I don't really remember hearing anything out of the ordinary.~|~translationMissing
No sounds of a struggle then?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't remember hearing anything like that.~|~translationMissing
How about the guard dog barking?~|~translationMissing
Oh that horrible dog is always barking at nothing but I don't think I did...~|~translationMissing
Honestly? I think it was Carol.~|~translationMissing
I saw her in a huge argument with Lord Sinclair in the library the other day. It was something to do with stolen books. She definitely seemed upset enough to have done it afterwards.~|~translationMissing
I was in town at the Inn. When I got back the house was swarming with guards who told me what had happened. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Well, like what?~|~translationMissing
I hear him bark all the time. It's one of his favorite things to do. I can't say I did the night of the murder though as I wasn't close enough to hear either way.~|~translationMissing
It was Anna. She is seriously unbalanced. She trashed the garden once then tried to blame it on me! I bet it was her. It's just the kind of thing she'd do!~|~translationMissing
She really hates me and was arguing with Lord Sinclair about trashing the garden a few days ago.~|~translationMissing
Right here, by my little shed. It's very cosy to sit and think in.~|~translationMissing
So no sounds of a struggle between Lord Sinclair and an intruder?~|~translationMissing
Not to the best of my recollection.~|~translationMissing
Not that I can recall.~|~translationMissing
There's some flypaper in there. Should I take it?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it might be useful.~|~translationMissing
You take a piece of fly paper. There is still plenty of fly paper left.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't see any need for it.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the silver necklace~|~translationMissing
I already have Anna's Necklace.~|~translationMissing
There's something shiny hidden at the bottom. You take Anna's Silver Necklace.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the silver cup~|~translationMissing
I already have Bob's cup.~|~translationMissing
There's something shiny hidden at the bottom. You take Bob's silver cup.~|~translationMissing

There's something shiny hidden at the bottom. You take Elizabeth's silver needle.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the silver pot~|~translationMissing
I already have Frank's pot.~|~translationMissing
There's something shiny hidden at the bottom. You take Frank's silver pot.~|~translationMissing
A barrel full of finely sifted flour.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an empty pot~|~translationMissing
You need something to put the flour in.~|~translationMissing
If the player has an empty pot~|~translationMissing
You take some flour from the barrel.~|~translationMissing
There's still plenty of flour left.~|~translationMissing
You probably shouldn't use evidence from a crime scene to keep flour in...~|~translationMissing
You sprinkle a small amount of flour on the murder weapon.~|~translationMissing
The murder weapon is now coated with a thin layer of flour.~|~translationMissing
You sprinkle a small amount of flour on the strange smelling pot.~|~translationMissing
The surface isn't shiny enough to take a fingerprint from.~|~translationMissing
You sprinkle the flour on Anna's necklace.~|~translationMissing
The necklace is now coated with a thin layer of flour.~|~translationMissing
You sprinkle the flour on Bob's cup.~|~translationMissing
The cup is now coated with a thin layer of flour.~|~translationMissing

The Needle is now coated with a thin layer of flour.~|~translationMissing
You sprinkle the flour on Frank's pot~|~translationMissing
The Pot is now coated with a thin layer of flour.~|~translationMissing

You have a clean impression of Frank's finger prints.~|~translationMissing
If Anna is the murderer~|~translationMissing
The finger prints are an exact match to Anna's.~|~translationMissing
If Anna is innocent~|~translationMissing
They don't seem to be the same. I guess that clears Anna of the crime. You destroy the useless fingerprint.~|~translationMissing
If Bob is the murderer~|~translationMissing
The finger prints are an exact match to Bob's.~|~translationMissing
If Bob is innocent~|~translationMissing
They don't seem to be the same. I guess that clears Bob of the crime. You destroy the useless fingerprint.~|~translationMissing

I'm investigating the murder at the Sinclair house.~|~translationMissing
Poison Salesman~|~translationMissing
There was a murder at the Sinclair House??? That's terrible! And I was only there the other day too! They bought the last of my Patented Multi Purpose Poison!~|~translationMissing
Patented Multi Purpose Poison?~|~translationMissing
Aaaaah... a miracle of modern apothecaries!~|~translationMissing
This exclusive concoction has been tested on all known forms of life and been proven to kill them all in varying dilutions from cockroaches to king dragons!~|~translationMissing
So incredibly versatile, it can be used as pest control, a cleansing agent, drain cleaner, metal polish and washes whiter than white,~|~translationMissing
all with our uniquely fragrant concoction that is immediately recognisable across the land as Peter Potter's Patented Poison potion!!!~|~translationMissing
The salesman stops for breath.~|~translationMissing
I'd love to sell you some but I've sold out recently. That's just how good it is! Three hundred and twenty eight people in this area alone cannot be wrong!~|~translationMissing
Nine out of Ten poisoners prefer it in controlled tests!~|~translationMissing
Can I help you with anything else?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I can take your name and add it to our mailing list of poison users? We will only send you information related to the use of poison and other Peter Potter Products!~|~translationMissing
Uh... no, it's ok. Really.~|~translationMissing
Who did you sell Poison to at the house?~|~translationMissing
Well, Peter Potter's Patented Multi Purpose Poison is a product of such obvious quality that I am glad to say I managed to sell a bottle to each of the Sinclairs!~|~translationMissing
Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Elizabeth and Frank all bought a bottle! In fact they bought the last of my supplies!~|~translationMissing
Maybe I can take your name and address and I will personally come and visit you when stocks return?~|~translationMissing
Uh... no, it's ok.~|~translationMissing
Can I buy some Poison?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I am totally out of stock at the moment after my successful trip to the Sinclairs' House the other day.~|~translationMissing
But don't worry! Our factories are working overtime to produce Peter Potter's Patented Multi Purpose Poison!~|~translationMissing
Possibly the finest multi purpose poison and cleaner yet available to the general market.~|~translationMissing
And its unique fragrance makes it the number one choice for cleaners and exterminators the whole country over!~|~translationMissing
I have this pot I found at the murder scene...~|~translationMissing
You show the poison salesman the pot you found at the murder scene with the unusual smell.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... yes, that smells exactly like my Patented Multi Purpose Poison, but I don't see how it could be. It quite clearly says on the label of all bottles~|~translationMissing
'Not to be taken internally - EXTREMELY POISONOUS'.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps someone else put it in his wine?~|~translationMissing
Yes... I suppose that could have happened...~|~translationMissing
Talk about the Murder Mystery Quest~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Talk about the Fremennik Trials~|~translationMissing
Why'd you buy poison the other day?~|~translationMissing
That useless Gardener Stanford has let his compost heap fester. It's an eyesore to the garden! So I bought some poison from a travelling salesman so that I could kill off some of the wildlife living in it.~|~translationMissing
What's it to you anyway?~|~translationMissing
If you absolutely must know, we had a problem with the beehive in the garden, and as all of our servants are so pathetically useless, I decided I would deal with it myself. So I did.~|~translationMissing
I don't see what on earth it has to do with you, but the drain outside was~|~translationMissing
blocked, and as nobody else here has the intelligence to even unblock a simple drain I felt I had to do it myself.~|~translationMissing
There was a nest of spiders upstairs between the two servants' quarters. Obviously I had to kill them before our pathetic servants whined at my father some more.~|~translationMissing
Honestly, it's like they expect to be treated like royalty! If I had my way I would fire the whole workshy lot of them!~|~translationMissing
There was a nest of mosquitos under the fountain in the garden, which I killed with poison the other day. You can see for yourself if you're capable of managing that, which I somehow doubt.~|~translationMissing
I hate mosquitos!~|~translationMissing
Doesn't everyone?~|~translationMissing
Would you like to buy some? I'm kind of strapped for cash right now, I'll sell it to you cheap, it's hardly been used at all.~|~translationMissing
I just used a bit to clean that family crest outside up a bit. Do you think I can get much money For the family crest, actually? It's cleaned up a bit now.~|~translationMissing
Do you know why so much poison was bought recently?~|~translationMissing
Well, I do know Frank bought some poison recently to clean the family crest that's outside.~|~translationMissing
It's very old and rusty, and I couldn't clean it myself, so he said he would buy some cleaner and clean it himself. He probably just got some from that Poison Salesman who came to the door the other day...~|~translationMissing
You'd really have to ask him though.~|~translationMissing
Well, I do know that Elizabeth was extremely annoyed by the mosquito nest under the fountain in the garden, and was going to do something about it. I suspect any poison she bought would have been~|~translationMissing
enough to get rid of it. A Good job too, I hate mosquitos.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, so do I.~|~translationMissing
You'd really have to ask her though.~|~translationMissing
I told Carol to buy some from that strange poison salesman and clean the drains before they began to smell any worse. She was the one who blocked them in the first place with a load~|~translationMissing
of beans that she bought for some reason. There were far too many to eat, and they were almost rotten when she bought them anyway! You'd really have to ask her though.~|~translationMissing
I overheard Anna saying to Stanford that if he didn't do something about the state of his compost heap, she was going to.~|~translationMissing
She really doesn't get on well with Stanford. I really have no idea why. You'd really have to ask her though.~|~translationMissing
Well, I know David said that he was going to do something about the spiders' nest that's between the two servants' quarters upstairs.~|~translationMissing
He made a big deal about it to Mary the Maid, calling her useless and incompetent. I felt quite sorry for her actually. You'd really have to ask him though.~|~translationMissing
Well, Bob mentioned to me the other day he wanted to get rid of the bees in that hive over there. I think I saw him buying poison~|~translationMissing
from that poison salesman the other day. I assume it was to sort out those bees. You'd really have to ask him though.~|~translationMissing
The compost is teeming with maggots. Somebody should really do something about it. It's certainly clear nobody's used poison here.~|~translationMissing
There is a faint smell of poison behind the smell of the compost.~|~translationMissing
The beehive buzzes with activity. These bees definitely don't seem poisoned at all.~|~translationMissing
The hive is empty. There are a few dead bees and a faint smell of poison.~|~translationMissing
The drain is totally blocked. It really stinks. No, it REALLY smells bad. It's certainly clear nobody's cleaned it recently.~|~translationMissing
The drain seems to have been recently cleaned. You can still smell the faint aroma of poison.~|~translationMissing
There is a spiders' nest here. You estimate there must be at least a few hundred spiders ready to hatch. It's certainly clear nobody's used poison here.~|~translationMissing
A faint smell of poison and a few dead spiders is all that remains of the spiders nest.~|~translationMissing
The fountain is swarming with mosquitos. There's a nest of them underneath the fountain.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of dead mosquitos around the base of the fountain. A faint smell of poison is in the air, but the water seems clean.~|~translationMissing
It looks like the Sinclair family crest but it is very dirty. You can barely make it out under all of the grime. It's certainly clear nobody's cleaned it recently.~|~translationMissing
The Sinclair family crest. It's shiny and freshly polished and has a slight smell of poison.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has the thread evidence~|~translationMissing
) I have proof that it wasn't any of the servants.~|~translationMissing
I have proof that it wasn't any of the servants!~|~translationMissing
All the servants dress in black so it couldn't have been one of them.~|~translationMissing
That's some good work there. I guess it wasn't a servant. You still haven't proved who did do it though.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has poison evidence~|~translationMissing
) I have proof one of the family lied about the poison.~|~translationMissing
I have proof that Anna is lying about the poison.~|~translationMissing
Oh really? How did you get that?~|~translationMissing
I have proof that Bob is lying about the poison.~|~translationMissing
You tell the guard about the beehive.~|~translationMissing
I have proof that Carol is lying about the poison.~|~translationMissing
You tell the guard about the drain.~|~translationMissing
I have proof that David is lying about the poison.~|~translationMissing
I have proof that Elizabeth is lying about the poison.~|~translationMissing
I have proof that Frank is lying about the poison.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. That's some good detective work there. We need more evidence before we can close the case though. Keep up the good work!~|~translationMissing
(If the player has fingerprint evidence~|~translationMissing
) I have the finger prints of the culprit.~|~translationMissing
I have the finger prints of the culprit!~|~translationMissing
I have Anna's finger prints here. You can see for yourself they match the finger prints on the murder weapon exactly.~|~translationMissing
I have Bob's finger prints here. You can see for yourself they match the finger prints on the murder weapon exactly.~|~translationMissing
I have Carol's finger prints here. You can see for yourself they match the finger prints on the murder weapon exactly.~|~translationMissing
I have David's finger prints here. You can see for yourself they match the finger prints on the murder weapon exactly.~|~translationMissing
I have Elizabeth's finger prints here. You can see for yourself they match the finger prints on the murder weapon exactly.~|~translationMissing
I have Frank's finger prints here. You can see for yourself they match the finger prints on the murder weapon exactly.~|~translationMissing
... I'm impressed. How on earth did you think of something like that? I've never heard of such a technique for finding criminals before!~|~translationMissing
This will come in very handy in the future but we can't arrest someone on just this. I'm afraid you'll still need to find more evidence before we can close this case completely.~|~translationMissing
I have conclusive proof who the killer was.~|~translationMissing
You do? That's excellent work. Let's hear it then.~|~translationMissing
I don't think it was an intruder, and I don't think Lord Sinclair was killed by being stabbed.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm? Really? Why not?~|~translationMissing
Nobody heard the guard dog barking, which it would have if it had been an intruder who was responsible.~|~translationMissing
Nobody heard any signs of a struggle either. I think the knife was there to throw suspicion away from the real culprit.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that makes sense. But who did do it then?~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard the thread matches Anna's clothes.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd have to agree with that... but we need more evidence!~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard Anna did not use poison on the compost heap.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work - have you considered a career as a detective? But I'm afraid it's still not quite enough...~|~translationMissing
You match Anna's finger prints with those on the dagger found in the body of Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
Yes. There's no doubt about it. It must have been Anna who killed her father. All of the guards must congratulate you on your excellent work in helping us to solve this case.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard the thread matches Bob's clothes.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard Bob did not use poison on the beehive.~|~translationMissing
You match Bob's finger prints with those on the dagger found in the body of Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
Yes. There's no doubt about it. It must have been Bob who killed his father. All of the guards must congratulate you on your excellent work in helping us to solve this case.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard the thread matches Carol's clothes.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard Carol did not use poison on the drain.~|~translationMissing
You match Carol's finger prints with those on the dagger found in the body of Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
Yes. There's no doubt about it. It must have been Carol who killed her father. All of the guards must congratulate you on your excellent work in helping us to solve this case.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard the thread matches David's clothes.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard David did not use poison on the spiders nest.~|~translationMissing
You match David's finger prints with those on the dagger found in the body of Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
Yes. There's no doubt about it. It must have been David who killed his father. All of the guards must congratulate you on your excellent work in helping us to solve this case.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard the thread matches Elizabeth's clothes.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard Elizabeth did not use poison on the fountain.~|~translationMissing
You match Elizabeth's finger prints with those on the dagger found in the body of Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
Yes. There's no doubt about it. It must have been Elizabeth who killed her father. All of the guards must congratulate you on your excellent work in helping us to solve this case.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard the thread matches Frank's clothes.~|~translationMissing
You prove to the guard Frank did not use poison on the Sinclair Crest.~|~translationMissing
You match Frank's finger prints with those on the dagger found in the body of Lord Sinclair.~|~translationMissing
Yes. There's no doubt about it. It must have been Frank who killed his father. All of the guards must congratulate you on your excellent work in helping us to solve this case.~|~translationMissing
We don't have many murders here in Gielinor and I'm afraid we wouldn't have been able to solve it by ourselves. We will hold her here under house arrest until such time as we bring her to trial.~|~translationMissing
You have our gratitude, and I'm sure the rest of the family's as well, in helping to apprehend the murderer. I'll just take the evidence from you now.~|~translationMissing
You hand over all the evidence.~|~translationMissing
Please accept this reward from the family!~|~translationMissing
Excellent work on solving the murder! All of the guards I know are very impressed, and don't worry, we have the murderer under guard until they can be taken to trial.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else I can do?~|~translationMissing
No, your work here is done.~|~translationMissing
Apparently you aren't as stupid as you look.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for all your help in solving the murder.~|~translationMissing

Hi, I was...~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the magnificent wonder of the Observatory, where wonder is all around you, where the stars can be clutched from the heavens!~|~translationMissing
Wow, nice intro.~|~translationMissing
Why, thanks! How might I help you?~|~translationMissing
I'm totally lost.~|~translationMissing
Lost? It must have been those pesky goblins that led you astray.~|~translationMissing
Head north-east to find the city of Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I'll find the way.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for all your help.~|~translationMissing
No problem at all. Come and visit again!~|~translationMissing
The professor carries on with his studies.~|~translationMissing
An Observatory?~|~translationMissing
Of course. We have a superb telescope up in the Observatory, on the hill.~|~translationMissing
A truly marvellous invention, the likes of which you'll never behold again.~|~translationMissing
Observatory assistant~|~translationMissing
Well, it would be if it worked.~|~translationMissing
Don't interrupt!~|~translationMissing
What? It doesn't work?~|~translationMissing
Oh, no, no, no. Don't listen to him, he's joking. Aren't you, my FAITHFUL assistant?~|~translationMissing
Nope, dead serious. Hasn't been working for a long time.~|~translationMissing
Arghhh! Get back to work and stop sticking your nose in!~|~translationMissing
So, it's broken. How come?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I suppose there's no use keeping it secret. Did you see those houses outside?~|~translationMissing
Up on the hill? Yes, I've seen them.~|~translationMissing
It's a horde of goblins.~|~translationMissing
Since they moved here they have caused nothing but trouble.~|~translationMissing
Last week, my telescope was tampered with.~|~translationMissing
Now, parts need replacing before it can be used again. They've even been messing around in the dungeons under this area. Something needs to be done.~|~translationMissing
Strikes me that this visitor could help us.~|~translationMissing
Stop being so rude.~|~translationMissing
Although, he has a point. What do you say?~|~translationMissing
What, me?~|~translationMissing
Start the Observatory Quest?~|~translationMissing
Sounds interesting, what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
Oh, thanks so much.~|~translationMissing
I shall need some materials for the telescope, so it can be used again.~|~translationMissing
Let's start with three planks of wood for the telescope base. My assistant will help with obtaining these, won't you?~|~translationMissing
As if I don't have enough work to do. Seems I don't have a choice.~|~translationMissing
Go talk to him if you need some advice.~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry, I don't have time for that.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. I really do need some help.~|~translationMissing
If you see anyone who can help then please send them my way.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Not everyone is interested in this place, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Talk about Treasure Trails.~|~translationMissing
Can I interrupt you?~|~translationMissing
I suppose so. Please be quick though.~|~translationMissing
Might I have a word?~|~translationMissing
Sure, how can I help you?~|~translationMissing
Can I speak with you?~|~translationMissing
Why, of course. What is it?~|~translationMissing
Where can I find planks of wood? I need some for the telescope's base.~|~translationMissing
I understand planks can be found at Port Khazard, to the east of here. There are  some at the Barbarian Outpost, too.~|~translationMissing
Failing that, you could always ask the Sawmill Operator. He's to the north-east of Varrock, by the Lumber Yard.~|~translationMissing
I have a plank.~|~translationMissing
That you do - but if you remember rightly, the professor wanted an ordinary wooden plank, like the ones at Port Khazard.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I see.~|~translationMissing
How about this plank I've got here?~|~translationMissing
I think the professor was after ordinary planks. You should be able to find them at Port Khazard.~|~translationMissing
I've got a plank.~|~translationMissing
That's nice.~|~translationMissing
You know, for the telescope's base.~|~translationMissing
Well done. Remember that you'll need three in total.~|~translationMissing
I've got some planks for the telescope's base.~|~translationMissing
Good work! The professor has been eagerly awaiting them.~|~translationMissing
Hi again!~|~translationMissing
It's my helping hand, back again.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the planks yet?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, not yet. Three planks was it?~|~translationMissing
It was indeed.~|~translationMissing
I've made a start.~|~translationMissing
Well, you'll need three of them.~|~translationMissing
I have a plank for you.~|~translationMissing
That's no good. I asked for ordinary planks. If you can't find out where they are, talk to my assistant.~|~translationMissing
How about this plank?~|~translationMissing
I asked for ordinary wooden planks. If you're not sure where to get them, speak to my assistant.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've got them. Here they are.~|~translationMissing
The player hands the three planks to the observatory professor.~|~translationMissing
Well done. This will make a big difference.~|~translationMissing
Now, the bronze for the tube. Oh, assistant!~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, ask me if you need any help, [player name].~|~translationMissing
The traveller returns!~|~translationMissing
Still working hard?~|~translationMissing
Some of us are.~|~translationMissing
What did I tell you about speaking when spoken to?~|~translationMissing
So, [player name], you have the bronze bar?~|~translationMissing
Please bring me one, then.~|~translationMissing
Can you help me? How do I go about getting a bronze bar?~|~translationMissing
You'll need to use tin and copper ore on a furnace to produce this metal.~|~translationMissing
Right you are.~|~translationMissing
The bronze bar is ready, and waiting for the professor.~|~translationMissing
He'll surely be pleased. Go ahead and give it to him.~|~translationMissing
I certainly do. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
The player hands the bronze bar to the observatory professor.~|~translationMissing
Great. Now all I need is the lens made.~|~translationMissing
Please get me some molten glass.~|~translationMissing
Oi! Lazy bones!~|~translationMissing
What? I'm not lazy.~|~translationMissing
Not you! I'm talking to my assistant.~|~translationMissing
Calm down old man, I heard. [player name], I'm here if you need any help.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Wait a minute, who you calling 'old'?~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on finding me some molten glass?~|~translationMissing
Still working on it.~|~translationMissing
I really need it. Please hurry.~|~translationMissing
What's the best way for me to get molten glass?~|~translationMissing
There are many ways, but I'd suggest making it yourself. Get yourself a bucket of sand and some soda ash, which you can get from using seaweed with a furnace. Use the soda ash and sand together in a~|~translationMissing
furnace and bang - molten glass is all yours. There's a book about it on the table if you want to know more.~|~translationMissing
I've managed to get hold of some molten glass.~|~translationMissing
I suggest you have a word with the professor, in that case.~|~translationMissing
The player hands the molten glass to the observatory professor.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work, let's make the lens.~|~translationMissing
It'll need to be made to an exact shape and size.~|~translationMissing
Well, obviously, hence why we have a lens mould.~|~translationMissing
Not any more. One of those goblins took it.~|~translationMissing
Great, just what I need. [player name], I don't suppose you could find it?~|~translationMissing
I'll have a look - where should I start?~|~translationMissing
No idea. You could ask my USELESS assistant if you want.~|~translationMissing
What have I done to deserve this?~|~translationMissing
Did you bring me the mould?~|~translationMissing
Still looking for it.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find this lens mould you mentioned?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I heard one of those goblins talking about it. I bet they've hidden it somewhere. Probably using it for some strange purpose, I'm sure.~|~translationMissing
What makes you say that?~|~translationMissing
I had a nice new star chart, until recently. I went out to do an errand for the professor the other day, only to see a goblin using it...~|~translationMissing
...as some kind of makeshift hankey to blow his nose!~|~translationMissing
You may want to look through the dungeon they have under their little village.~|~translationMissing
The chest is empty.~|~translationMissing
This chest contains a poisonous spider.~|~translationMissing
This chest contains some antipoison.~|~translationMissing
You find a kitchen key.~|~translationMissing
You already have a kitchen key.~|~translationMissing
Another one will be of no use.~|~translationMissing
Dialogue4~|~translationMissing
I found a key.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps it unlocks something.~|~translationMissing
Oh, thanks. Great advice.~|~translationMissing
Look. I found this.~|~translationMissing
A key?~|~translationMissing
To what?~|~translationMissing
Well, I don't know. Perhaps some amazing treasure!~|~translationMissing
I doubt it.~|~translationMissing
Look, I found this!~|~translationMissing
It doesn't look much like a lens mould.~|~translationMissing
What? No. It's a key!~|~translationMissing
Well,I don't really know yet.~|~translationMissing
No, but I found a key.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. You might be onto something there. Keep looking.~|~translationMissing
Will do, thanks.~|~translationMissing
If you open the gate, the guard will hear you. You need to get rid of him.~|~translationMissing
You need to get rid of that goblin guard first.~|~translationMissing
Oi, how dare you wake me up!~|~translationMissing
You had better be quick, there may be more guards about.~|~translationMissing
The goblins appear to have been using the lens mould to cook their stew!~|~translationMissing
You shake out its contents and take it with you.~|~translationMissing
Euuuw, that smells awful!~|~translationMissing
I have the lens mould.~|~translationMissing
Well done on finding that! I am honestly quite impressed. Make sure you take it straight to the professor.~|~translationMissing
I certainly have. You'll never guess what they were doing with it.~|~translationMissing
Well, from the smell I'd guess cooking some vile concoction.~|~translationMissing
Wow, good guess. Well, here you go.~|~translationMissing
Please don't give that to him. Last time he tried any Crafting, I had to spend a week cleaning up after the explosion.~|~translationMissing
Explosion?~|~translationMissing
Erm, yes. I think in this instance you had probably better do it.~|~translationMissing
I suppose it's better I don't ask.~|~translationMissing
You can use the mould with molten glass to make a new lens.~|~translationMissing
The observatory professor hands the player the molten glass.~|~translationMissing
The professor gives you back the molten glass.~|~translationMissing
Hold on a second. I don't have space to carry it all.~|~translationMissing
Hurry and free up some space, then.~|~translationMissing
Is the lens finished?~|~translationMissing
How do I make it again?~|~translationMissing
Use the molten glass with the mould.~|~translationMissing
Huh. Simple.~|~translationMissing
How should I make this lens?~|~translationMissing
Just use the molten glass with the mould. Simple.~|~translationMissing
You pour the molten glass into the mould and clasp it together...~|~translationMissing
You pour the molten glass into the mould and clasp it together... It has produced a small, convex glass disc.~|~translationMissing
Do you like this lens? Good, huh?~|~translationMissing
Nice. What's that scratch?~|~translationMissing
Oh, erm, that's a feature.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's it! Indubitably, it facilitates the triangulation of photonic illumination to the correct...~|~translationMissing
Stop! You can't confuse me with big words. Just pray the professor doesn't notice.~|~translationMissing
Yes, here it is. You may as well take this mould too.~|~translationMissing
The player hands the observatory professor the observatory lens.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful, at last I can fix the telescope.~|~translationMissing
Would you accompany me to the Observatory? You simply must see the telescope in operation.~|~translationMissing
Sounds interesting. Count me in.~|~translationMissing
Superb. You'll have to go via the dungeon under the goblin settlement, seeing as the bridge is broken. You'll find stairs up to the Observatory from there.~|~translationMissing
Okay. See you there.~|~translationMissing
The professor has gone ahead to the Observatory dome. Best you follow him to see the finished telescope.~|~translationMissing
Ah, it's the telescope repairman! The professor is waiting for you in the Observatory.~|~translationMissing
How can I get to the Observatory?~|~translationMissing
Well, since the bridge was ruined, you will have to travel through the dungeon under the goblins' settlement.~|~translationMissing
~ The Observatory ~ The great eye into the heavens.~|~translationMissing
A 360 degree overhead view of the observatory~|~translationMissing
A close up of the player and professor at the telescope as the professor fixes it~|~translationMissing
Hi, professor!~|~translationMissing
Oh, hi there.~|~translationMissing
I'm just adding the finishing touches.~|~translationMissing
Okay, don't let me interrupt.~|~translationMissing
Right, let's get this finished.~|~translationMissing
Bit of a tap here...~|~translationMissing
[player name], I'm just going upstairs to finish off.~|~translationMissing
Right-oh.~|~translationMissing
In goes the lens.~|~translationMissing
Looking good.~|~translationMissing
And one final adjustment.~|~translationMissing
And all our work pays off.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back.~|~translationMissing
Hi, this really is impressive.~|~translationMissing
Certainly is. Please, take a look through the telescope and tell me what you see.~|~translationMissing
You look through the telescope.~|~translationMissing
I've had a look through the telescope.~|~translationMissing
What did you see? If you're not sure, you can find out by looking at the star charts dotted around the walls downstairs.~|~translationMissing
It was...~|~translationMissing
Aquarius~|~translationMissing
Aquarius!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Aquarius~|~translationMissing
That's exactly it!~|~translationMissing
Yes! Woo hoo!~|~translationMissing
If the player has inventory space for the reward~|~translationMissing
That's Aquarius, the water-bearer.~|~translationMissing
It seems suitable, then, to award you with water runes!~|~translationMissing
By Saradomin's earlobes! You must be a friend of the gods indeed.~|~translationMissing
Look in your backpack for your reward, in payment for your work.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have inventory space for the reward~|~translationMissing
Have you got some space for your reward?~|~translationMissing
Reward? Oh, no, I haven't.~|~translationMissing
Come see me again when you have a few free spaces in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
If the player did not this sign~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. Have another look. Remember, you can check the star charts on the walls for reference.~|~translationMissing
Capricorn~|~translationMissing
Capricorn!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Capricorn~|~translationMissing
That's Capricorn, the goat.~|~translationMissing
Capricorn will surely reward your insight with an increase to your Strength.~|~translationMissing
Sagittarius~|~translationMissing
Sagittarius!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Sagittarius~|~translationMissing
That's Sagittarius, the centaur.~|~translationMissing
As you've spotted the archer, I shall reward you with a maple longbow.~|~translationMissing
Scorpio~|~translationMissing
Scorpio!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Scorpio~|~translationMissing
That's Scorpio, the scorpion.~|~translationMissing
I think weapon poison would make a suitable reward.~|~translationMissing
~ next ~~|~translationMissing
~ previous ~~|~translationMissing
Libra~|~translationMissing
Libra!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Libra~|~translationMissing
That's Libra, the scales.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, balance, law, order - I shall award you with law runes!~|~translationMissing
Virgo~|~translationMissing
Virgo!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Virgo~|~translationMissing
That's Virgo, the virtuous.~|~translationMissing
Virgo will surely provide you with an increase to Defence.~|~translationMissing
Leo~|~translationMissing
Leo!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Leo~|~translationMissing
That's Leo, the lion.~|~translationMissing
I think the majestic power of the lion will raise your Hitpoints.~|~translationMissing
Cancer~|~translationMissing
Cancer!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Cancer~|~translationMissing
That's Cancer, the crab.~|~translationMissing
An armoured creature - I think I shall reward you with an amulet of protection.~|~translationMissing
Gemini~|~translationMissing
Gemini!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Gemini~|~translationMissing
That's Gemini, the twins.~|~translationMissing
With the double nature of Gemini, I can't offer you anything more suitable than a two-handed weapon.~|~translationMissing
Taurus~|~translationMissing
Taurus!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Taurus~|~translationMissing
That's Taurus, the bull.~|~translationMissing
This Strength potion should be a suitable reward.~|~translationMissing
Aries~|~translationMissing
Aries!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Aries~|~translationMissing
That's Aries, the ram.~|~translationMissing
A fierce fighter. I'm sure he'll look down on you and improve your Attack for such insight.~|~translationMissing
Pisces~|~translationMissing
Pisces!~|~translationMissing
If the player did see Pisces~|~translationMissing
That's Pisces, the fish.~|~translationMissing
What's more suitable as a reward than some tuna?~|~translationMissing

Get lost, outlander! I've no time for you!~|~translationMissing
Who is that? Identify yourself!~|~translationMissing
It's me, [player name]. What are you doing out here?~|~translationMissing
Nothing... Just carving these horribly broken pieces of driftwood.~|~translationMissing
In the middle of nowhere.~|~translationMissing
In damp clothing.~|~translationMissing
Well, have a nice day.~|~translationMissing
Wait! Would you do me a favour?~|~translationMissing
What kind of a favour?~|~translationMissing
Look, you see that heap of driftwood over there? That is my ship, and all that is left of my one shot at making my ancestors proud of me.~|~translationMissing
My family have always been great explorers and seafarers, and I recently set off on my maiden voyage.~|~translationMissing
However, a big storm - yes, a huge storm in fact - blew my ship onto the rocks. Three times.~|~translationMissing
I've been sitting here ever since, trying to think of a way to make my family proud, and if you will help me...I think I have a way.~|~translationMissing
Start Olaf's Quest?~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll help you out.~|~translationMissing
Thank you! I don't have much apart from my carvings, some driftwood and the map that I was following when I had my little...~|~translationMissing
...accident.~|~translationMissing
If you help me out, then I'll gladly hand it over.~|~translationMissing
So, what is your plan?~|~translationMissing
Well, I have a little food left, although it's a little briny.~|~translationMissing
If you take a couple of carvings to my wife and son in the village over the hill and tell them that I sent you with them from a distant island, then I can wait out here for a week or so before returning.~|~translationMissing
Alright, hand me over the carvings and I'll be on my way.~|~translationMissing
Well, none of these are any good. I'll need some fresh wood from a decent tree.~|~translationMissing
When I was swimming for my life I saw an odd-looking windswept tree to the east of here, up that cliff.~|~translationMissing
Could you bring me some of that wood so I can work it?~|~translationMissing
Wow, you must have pretty good eyes to be able to see a single tree from the water during a heavy storm.~|~translationMissing
Yes...great eyes...they run in the family.~|~translationMissing
Possibly later, when you don't smell so damp.~|~translationMissing
Bah! Well, if you aren't going to help, do me a favour and jump off that cliff!~|~translationMissing
So... Got the logs for me yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I just popped back to see how you were doing.~|~translationMissing
Still cold. Still damp. 'Bout average, really.~|~translationMissing
Olaf, I cut some logs from the tree. Here's the wood.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! I'll carve them up now.~|~translationMissing
Olaf carves furiously.~|~translationMissing
Done!~|~translationMissing
That's it?~|~translationMissing
Yep!~|~translationMissing
This is for my wife, Ingrid. I'm sure she will love it. Tell her it's tribal or something.~|~translationMissing
Sure...~|~translationMissing
And this one is for my son, Volf. Kids love planks in my experience. Tell him I said hello.~|~translationMissing
Alright. They live in Rellekka, right?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Hurry back! And don't forget the story~|~translationMissing
I'm not here, I'm someplace far away.~|~translationMissing
So, how did my wife like her carving?~|~translationMissing
If Ingrid's present has not been delivered yet~|~translationMissing
I don't know... I've still got it.~|~translationMissing
Well, hurry up and give it to her then!~|~translationMissing
If Ingrid's present has been delivered~|~translationMissing
She was very happy with it!~|~translationMissing
Wonderful!~|~translationMissing
I wish i[sic] could see her again...~|~translationMissing
Well, if this plan works out you will be able too, right?~|~translationMissing
Yes, you're right.~|~translationMissing
Did my son like his present? I'll bet he was thrilled.~|~translationMissing
I'll bet he will be... but I've still got it.~|~translationMissing
Well, take your time over it, why don't you.~|~translationMissing
If Volf's present has been delivered~|~translationMissing
Excuse me, but are you Ingrid? The same Ingrid that is married to Olaf Hradson?~|~translationMissing
Ingrid Hradson~|~translationMissing
Yes I am. Why do you ask?~|~translationMissing
I am a friend of your husband. He sent me here with a gift for you.~|~translationMissing
An expensive, exotic gift from the far-flung and tropical shores of the Island of Obscurity.~|~translationMissing
How wonderful! I assumed from the way the big oaf always referred to the rigging as 'big strings' that he couldn't navigate his way out of a soggy paper bag. So, can I see the gift he sent?~|~translationMissing
Certainly! Here it is. He sends his best wishes along with it.~|~translationMissing
I see. It looks like a log with 'Olaf was here' carved in it.~|~translationMissing
It's tribal! Very tribal! I watched the natives carve it myself.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Bread.)~|~translationMissing
Well, since you have come such a long way, you can have this. I baked it this morning, so it's still nice and fresh.~|~translationMissing
Oh, thank you! Enjoy your Obscurian Tribal Artefact(tm). It has a million-and-one uses!~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Have you any word from my husband?~|~translationMissing
Err, no, not yet. It takes a while for the messages to reach me, you know.~|~translationMissing
Well, when you do, tell him we'll be more than happy to see him again.~|~translationMissing
Volf? Son of Olaf Hradson?~|~translationMissing
Volf Olafson~|~translationMissing
Yes. Do I know you?~|~translationMissing
No, but I do know your father. He sent me with a present for you from, err...~|~translationMissing
From the Island of Obscurity.~|~translationMissing
Oh! That was fast! He only set off recently, and I was wondering how he was doing. So, where is this gift?~|~translationMissing
Right here. Enjoy!~|~translationMissing
Very valuable. Have a nice time!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Shark.)~|~translationMissing
Wait! Here, take this. I was going to have it for my lunch, but I suppose you can have it in payment.~|~translationMissing
Thanks! Enjoy your new...thing!~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Does my father send any word...or treasures like before?~|~translationMissing
Not today, but if he does, you will be the first to know.~|~translationMissing
Olaf, are you all right?~|~translationMissing
So...cold...need...fire.~|~translationMissing
I delivered your carvings as you asked. Your family would like to see you again.~|~translationMissing
Here, let me get you to the village before you freeze to death.~|~translationMissing
I won't...go...anywhere. I don't...care if I...freeze.~|~translationMissing
I'd rather...die...than suffer...the shame.~|~translationMissing
Just get the...fire burning. Use...these.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives damp planks.)~|~translationMissing
Well, at least give me the map like you promised!~|~translationMissing
Too...cold...to...hear...whining.~|~translationMissing
So...very...cold. Almost cold enough to tear up an old map with my fevered shivering. Cough, cough.~|~translationMissing
You managed to get the fire going!~|~translationMissing
Ahhhhhhhh... Much better.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm glad you're happy. Can I have that map now?~|~translationMissing
Well, okay...but could I have a little of that food first? I've had nothing but seaweed and biscuits for the past week.~|~translationMissing
Alright, here, have some food. Now give me the map.~|~translationMissing
Not a chance.~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, I was only asking.~|~translationMissing
Well, regardless, you've more than earned this map. It was the last one my grandfather, Sven the Helmsman, ever made.~|~translationMissing
It is supposed to show the location of one of his stashes of treasure, but I have never been able to decipher the strange, runic inscriptions that point the way.~|~translationMissing
I wish you luck!~|~translationMissing
Well, thanks. What will you do now?~|~translationMissing
I'll sit here and practice carving.~|~translationMissing
If you pass this way again, I'll be glad if you drop my next load of work off with my family.~|~translationMissing
That or bring me some food before I starve. Whichever.~|~translationMissing
Olaf hands you the map.~|~translationMissing
Hey! I'm trying to carve and you're standing in my light! Move it!~|~translationMissing
Olaf, I seem to have lost your map, can I have another?~|~translationMissing
You lost the treasured map of Sven the Helmsman? How dare you!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Sven's last map.)~|~translationMissing
You'd best take better care of this one, or else!~|~translationMissing
You dig a hole...~|~translationMissing
...and fall into a dark and slimy pit!~|~translationMissing
This 'wall' has some disks set into it showing a picture and some levers. I should try pulling the levers to see what happens.~|~translationMissing
Something in the wall goes 'clink'.~|~translationMissing

(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about this antiques business.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else interesting to do around here?~|~translationMissing
Yanni Salika~|~translationMissing
You sound a bit bored of Shilo Village...what's wrong?~|~translationMissing
Nothing, I was just wondering if there was anything else to do?~|~translationMissing
Well, if you're bored, you could do me a small favour and nip to see the jungle forester. I need a piece of red mahogany to resurface an antique wardrobe.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a combat level less than 45~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended level of 45.~|~translationMissing
Start the One Small Favour quest?~|~translationMissing
Ok, see you in a tick!~|~translationMissing
Great, nice of you to do it for me.~|~translationMissing
I'll get going then!~|~translationMissing
That'd be helpful!~|~translationMissing
Where do I meet this jungle forester?~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry, I thought you knew the area. You'll find a jungle forester in between the southern edge of Shilo Village and the Kharazi Jungle.~|~translationMissing
They're always trying to find ways into that place.~|~translationMissing
I hear that some old timer from the Legends Guild keeps sending new recruits down there..only Zamorak knows why.~|~translationMissing
Nah thanks, I've got bigger fish to fry.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough! Hope it all goes well...but, you know, you looked bored so I just thought I'd suggest it.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have any interesting items for sale?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Hmm, sorry, not interested.~|~translationMissing
What was I supposed to do again?~|~translationMissing
I've forgotten what to do, can you remind me?~|~translationMissing
Tsk....It's only a little job bwana, I ask you to do me one small favour! Go to the jungle forester and get me a piece of red mahogany. It can't be that difficult can it?~|~translationMissing
This is taking longer than I expected!~|~translationMissing
You're telling me bwana, I was supposed to have this wardrobe finished before now! Hurry it up will you, I don't have all day!~|~translationMissing
Is there an easier way of getting this exotic wood?~|~translationMissing
Huh! You make it sound like a major undertaking! I should have just done it myself!~|~translationMissing
Everyone is asking me to do them favours now! It seems like I've opened the floodgates!~|~translationMissing
Well, can't you just do my favour and forget about theirs?~|~translationMissing
Jungle forester~|~translationMissing
Hello friend. You're a long way from Lumbridge!~|~translationMissing
I need to talk to you about red mahogany.~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes, well I can get you a piece but I need my axe sharpening... Do me a small favour would you? Take it to Captain Shanks for me.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll take your axe to get it sharpened.~|~translationMissing
The Jungle Forester hands you the blunt axe.~|~translationMissing
Great, here you go! If you could ask the Captain to pop it into Brian's Axes for resharpening when he's next in Port Sarim, that would be really helpful.~|~translationMissing
Why should I take it to Captain Shanks?~|~translationMissing
He's the Captain of the 'Lady of the Waves', he goes to Port Sarim quite often. Could you ask the Captain to drop the axe in at Brian's Axes the next time he's in Port Sarim? I'm sure he won't mind!~|~translationMissing
Where is Captain Shanks?~|~translationMissing
Wow, you're really not from around here are you? The Captain is to the west of here, follow the northern edge of the Kharazi Jungle, he's usually on board his ship!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How do I get into the Kharazi Jungle?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I have a question about my Achievement Diary.~|~translationMissing
I gave you my blunt axe to give to Captain Shanks. I was hoping that he would be able to pop it into Brian's Axes in Port Sarim to get it sharpened. I do hope nothing bad has happened to my axe, I am very partial~|~translationMissing
to it!~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes... okay! No, I'm sure that nothing bad has happened to it. I mean, you gave it to me, I'm really dependable!~|~translationMissing
Take the blunt axe to Captain Shanks and ask him to take it to Brian's Axes.~|~translationMissing
Who is it that I'm supposed to meet?~|~translationMissing
You're supposed to take the axe to Captain Shanks and ask him to take it Brian's Axes in Port Sarim. I'm sure he won't mind.~|~translationMissing
Do you really actually need that axe?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, actually. It's my favourite! I've been training with that axe since I started my profession as a jungle forester.~|~translationMissing
I've lost your unsharpened axe, I need a new one.~|~translationMissing
I know. Another jungle forester found it and returned it to me. Here, take it again and this time don't lose it!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I promise to be more careful.~|~translationMissing
Captain Shanks~|~translationMissing
Hello there shipmate! I sail to Khazard Port and to Port Sarim. Where are you bound?~|~translationMissing
Actually I have a favour to ask.~|~translationMissing
A favour you say...hmmm. What is it?~|~translationMissing
I have an axe from the jungle forester, I wonder if you could nip into Brian's Axes in Port Sarim and get it sharpened for the jungle forester.~|~translationMissing
Darned cheek! I have a tight ship to run, my friend, and I'll thank you to not take advantage of my good generosity. I have a far superior solution to your problem.~|~translationMissing
Take a ride with me to Port Sarim and take the axe to Brian yourself!~|~translationMissing
But...I was only meant to do a small favour for Yanni Salika...I don't want to go to Port Sarim!~|~translationMissing
Well...the choice is yours! Do like me and never do favours...you'll find yourself in a lot less bother I can assure you!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Hmm, I'm interested in a boat trip.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) So, are you selling something?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) 'Ello~|~translationMissing
Do you sharpen axes?~|~translationMissing
Brian~|~translationMissing
You know what, normally I do...but...~|~translationMissing
But...what?~|~translationMissing
But... what?~|~translationMissing
But I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment. I'm worried that my friend is going to spend the rest of the year behind bars!~|~translationMissing
It sounds serious!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, it is, but it shouldn't be. It was only a harmless pub brawl but he got caught up in it and they just jailed everyone.~|~translationMissing
Except he says he's going to run away to the wilderness if he's found guilty and you know what blood-hungry scum inhabit those realms.~|~translationMissing
Look, can you sharpen this cursed axe or what?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'd like to. I really would, but I wouldn't be able to concentrate while worrying about my friend so much. I tell you what. If you could do me just one small favour, I promise to help you!~|~translationMissing
Oh, so you want a favour doing as well?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, if you wouldn't mind? Aggie the witch is a family friend and she's a pillar of the local community.~|~translationMissing
I know you wouldn't think it would you! Could you ask her if she'll act as a character witness for my friend?~|~translationMissing
Oh, please. It would mean such a lot to me! Just ask Aggie if she'll be a character witness for my friend. She only lives in Draynor Village. It'll only take you a few minutes!~|~translationMissing
Is there anyone else who can sharpen this axe?~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok, I'll do it! I'll go and see Aggie.~|~translationMissing
(Blunt axe is removed from the player's inventory.)~|~translationMissing
Oh, great, that would be really helpful! Here, give me the axe for safe keeping and I'll get it sharpened as soon as she agrees to help.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well you could try your luck in Lumbridge at Bob's Axes, though I've no clue if he offers this kind of service.~|~translationMissing
He always seemed very focused on selling axes to blood-hungry killers keen to explore the wilderness.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, yes, that looks pretty badly damaged. Unfortunately, I don't have the tools to fix it, but Brian over in Port Sarim might be able to.~|~translationMissing
Go talk to Aggie and ask her if she'll be a character witness for my friend before he finds himself in jail with less than savoury people...or worse, he runs off to the wilderness!~|~translationMissing
Oh, right, yes, sorry, I forgot..~|~translationMissing
So it seems!~|~translationMissing
Hey you're a witch aren't you?~|~translationMissing
My, you're observant!~|~translationMissing
Continues with regular options~|~translationMissing
Could I ask you about being a character witness?~|~translationMissing
Not at the minute I'm afraid...I'm really worried! My new apprentice 'Jimmy the Chisel' has gone missing!~|~translationMissing
'Jimmy the Chisel' - what kind of name is that?~|~translationMissing
It's sort of like a 'street name'...it's a new fad [player name]...perhaps you've seen it around? Anyway, it's not his name I'm concerned with, it's his whereabouts that worries me!~|~translationMissing
What do you mean missing?~|~translationMissing
Well, I sent him to Lumbridge to get some supplies and he hasn't come back! He left about two days ago and I've seen neither hide nor hair of him all that time.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea where he might be?~|~translationMissing
Not really, I mean, not for definite. But I did hear old Ned talking about some strange activity in that ruined building infested with goblins and spiders in between here and Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
It's probably nothing...but it would aid my mind a lot to know he was safe. I can't leave here until he returns. What if he's had an accident and needs some emergency magical attention?~|~translationMissing
Let me guess, you're going to ask me to do you a favour?~|~translationMissing
Would you my dear, it would only be a small favour...one small favour, that's all I ask.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I seem to have heard that one before. Go on then, what do you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
Could you go on and check out that abandoned building and see if there's anything odd going on. Just check to see if there's any sign of young Jimmy.~|~translationMissing
No way...I've had enough of doing favours for people.~|~translationMissing
Why you big meanie! He could be dead for all you know!~|~translationMissing
Oh, Ok, I'll see if I can find Jimmy.~|~translationMissing
Oh, thanks ever so much...I do appreciate it! Good Luck!~|~translationMissing
Well, I had hoped that you would go and look for 'Jimmy the Chisel'...but it looks like you've had other 'more important' things to do!~|~translationMissing
Where am I supposed to look?~|~translationMissing
I don't know where he is! But I suggest that you check out that ruined building to the east, you know, the one with all the spiders in it! Doesn't look like anyone's been living in there for years!~|~translationMissing
What am I doing this for?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't know, you mumbled something about 'witnesses', I just can't think straight worrying so much about that poor little Jimmy.~|~translationMissing
He could be lying somewhere in a pool of his blood, crying out for help...oooh, it's too much for me to bear.~|~translationMissing
Johanhus Ulsbrecht~|~translationMissing
Welcome [Brother/Sister]...to our organisation...ours is a fight for humanity in all its shapes and forms...and to rid mankind of the monsters that exist in our world. We have no quarrel with a fellow [brother/sister].~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What kind of organisation is this?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Who are you and what do you do here?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ok, thanks.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Jimmy the Chisel.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, he'll be joining our ranks very soon, I feel. He's still quite young and strong, but he will see the error of his ways before too long.~|~translationMissing
Huh, it sounds like you're forcing him to join you~|~translationMissing
Not at all...he just needs some time to think about things...we've given him all the time he needs in the cage back there.~|~translationMissing
Well, I have to return him to his employer, she's very worried about him, so if you could just hand him over...I'll be getting out of your way.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I can't do that...he has value to us...he's related to a farmer named Fred who lives near here. We need to arrange some things with this 'Brother Fred' so that my people down here can eat.~|~translationMissing
What kind of organisation is this?~|~translationMissing
Who are you and what do you do here?~|~translationMissing
And I suppose you need me to do you a favour?~|~translationMissing
Well, actually, now that you mention it...it would be a real help to us if you could organise some chickens in exchange for young Jimmy's release.~|~translationMissing
Ok, just exactly what is it that you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
Go to Brother Fred the farmer and tell him that we have young Brother Jimmy. Tell him that we're not going to let him free until he agrees to send us a month's supply of chickens.~|~translationMissing
No way...go do your own dirty work!~|~translationMissing
Now, now [player name], I'm a little disappointed in you! Can't you see that this is merely a business transaction?~|~translationMissing
Come back and see me when you change your mind!~|~translationMissing
Ok, Jimmy has to be worth more than a few scrawny chickens!~|~translationMissing
That's exactly right! Do this for us and we'll let Brother Jimmy go!~|~translationMissing
I'm back!~|~translationMissing
Welcome back [Brother/Sister] [player name], how are your negotiations going with Brother Fred?~|~translationMissing
Oh for the love of Saradomin...it's not too difficult! Go to Brother Fred and ask him to supply a month's worth of chickens in return for Brother Jimmy's freedom!~|~translationMissing
Can't you just release Jimmy the Chisel?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course....why didn't you ask earlier? Is that all you wanted? Huh!~|~translationMissing
Of course, you do have the chickens don't you?~|~translationMissing
Er...not exactly!~|~translationMissing
Go get them then!~|~translationMissing
I don't think I can do this.~|~translationMissing
That's a shame, because Brother Jimmy is getting older every day! His employer isn't going to be too pleased if you don't do something soon.~|~translationMissing
I need to talk to you about Jimmy.~|~translationMissing
What's the problem with Jimmy?~|~translationMissing
He's being kept prisoner by a bunch of fanatics and I need to organise a delivery of a month's supply of chickens to secure his release.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, oh dear, this is terrible. Terrible!~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's pretty bad...but keep calm, I'm going to help.~|~translationMissing
I've no idea what to do!~|~translationMissing
Well, no actually. I'm just a farmer. I've no idea how to deal with fanatics!~|~translationMissing
Well, can't you just give me some chickens?~|~translationMissing
Normally I'd say yes, but I just don't have enough for a month's supply.~|~translationMissing
Well, do you know someone who does have a month's supply?~|~translationMissing
Seth does, Seth Groats. He's another farmer over yonder at the other farm. Over the river and on the way to Varrock, he has loads of chickens.~|~translationMissing
What did you suggest I do again?~|~translationMissing
Have you been to Seth Groats yet? He's over at the other farm on the way to Varrock!~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go and see him then.~|~translationMissing
Seth Groats~|~translationMissing
Hello there stranger, what's the meaning of this intrusion? A farmer's hovel is his castle!~|~translationMissing
Sorry for the intrusion, but this is quite urgent. Jimmy the Chisel is being held by fanatics. They won't release him until they get a month's supply of chickens.~|~translationMissing
I've already talked to Fred but he says he doesn't have a month's supply of chickens. Is there any way that you could help?~|~translationMissing
A month's supply eh! Well, I was going to take them to market and just concentrate on the cows, but I reckon that little Jimmy's neck is worth a few scrawny chickens, don't you?~|~translationMissing
That's exactly what I said...~|~translationMissing
Well, Ok then. We need to get this organised. First off, we need to get some proper cages to get them chickens transported. I've never normally transported chickens in such large quantities before.~|~translationMissing
What do you propose?~|~translationMissing
We'll need to get some proper cages, but I have nothing like that here. You'll have to go and see my friend Horvik in Varrock. He's a pretty well known metal-smith and he's done me a few favours in the past.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that I'll have to ask a small favour of you as well, my friend.~|~translationMissing
I had a feeling you might!~|~translationMissing
Could you get three bars of steel and take them to Horvik, that's what I owe him for a previous job that he did for me.~|~translationMissing
No way, I'm fed up with this wild goose chase!~|~translationMissing
I understand...~|~translationMissing
Poor old Jimmy, locked in that cage...~|~translationMissing
Forever!~|~translationMissing
Oh, ok! I guess it's not that much further to Varrock!~|~translationMissing
Many thanks! Remember, you need to take him three steel bars.~|~translationMissing
You need to get three bars of steel and take them to Horvik in Varrock, ask him if he can make some chicken cages so that we can transport these chickens to those fanatics and release poor Jimmy.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes...I remember now.~|~translationMissing
How are those chicken cages coming along?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I don't have any yet.~|~translationMissing
Horvik~|~translationMissing
Hello, do you need any help?~|~translationMissing
Hi, I need to talk to you about chicken cages!~|~translationMissing
Hi, I need to talk to you about chicken cages! Seth Groats has asked me to come and see you!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, Seth eh! He's a good friend, but he still owes me three steel bars for a plough I fixed. I'm sorry but I need to have that paid off first before I can do any more work for him.~|~translationMissing
If player does not have enough steel bars~|~translationMissing
But I don't have three steel bars at the moment!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to be so harsh, but I have to ensure the debt is paid before I do any more work for Seth.~|~translationMissing
With at least 3 steel bars in inventory~|~translationMissing
Ok, well I have three steel bars here, you can have these.~|~translationMissing
Ok then! Great...tell me a little more about these chicken cages... Cough Cough Cough!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, you don't sound too well?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not actually, I'm quite ill!~|~translationMissing
Well that's a shame because I really need your help to make some chicken cages!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but the most I can manage today is simple trading...however, if I was to get some medicine say, I could be persuaded to do you a small favour!~|~translationMissing
Oh I see, you need me to do you a favour?~|~translationMissing
Well, just one small favour...and then I'll do you a small favour.~|~translationMissing
Oh, no not another favour...I just can't do another one!~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm sorry about that...but I just can't work when I'm feeling so ill.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I guess one good turn deserves another.~|~translationMissing
Horvik takes the steel bars.~|~translationMissing
Well that's jolly decent of you my friend. I need some medicine, could you get me some herbal tincture and breathing salts, that should solve my ailments!~|~translationMissing
Well, hopefully, I'll be right back, but you never know, it might take longer!~|~translationMissing
That's great! However, I must warn you, it'll be a lot easier for me to simply adjust some existing pigeon cages. If you could get me five or so of those, that would help a lot.~|~translationMissing
But first things first, bring me the medicine!~|~translationMissing
What was I supposed to be doing?~|~translationMissing
Please can you get me some medicine? I need herbal tincture and a pot of breathing salts. Also, get me five or so of those pigeon cages that they have over in Ardougne so that I can convert them into chicken~|~translationMissing
cages.~|~translationMissing
Talk about One Small Favour.~|~translationMissing
Horvik is ill, I need breathing salts and herbal tincture.~|~translationMissing
The Apothecary shows you the herbal tincture.~|~translationMissing
There you do! There's your herbal tincture!~|~translationMissing
Wow, that was surprisingly easy! Fantastic, thanks very much.~|~translationMissing
No problem, pleased to help.~|~translationMissing
Oh...but...what about the breathing salts...~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes, breathing salts...erm, just let me look around. I'm sure I have some around here somewhere.~|~translationMissing
Yep, here they are....~|~translationMissing
The Apothecary gets out a jar of breathing salts.~|~translationMissing
Oh blimey...I've dropped the pot and smashed it!~|~translationMissing
That's ok, just hand over the breathing salts.~|~translationMissing
Oh no, you don't understand. They're ruined. They're supposed to be kept in an airtight container and this was my last one.~|~translationMissing
I can't order any more in until I have a new airtight container. And they were a top selling item as well.~|~translationMissing
I just knew this wasn't going to be easy! So you can't get any more breathing salts?~|~translationMissing
No, I can..I can order plenty, but they'll lose their effectiveness. I need an airtight pot to keep them in.~|~translationMissing
Where would you get one of those from?~|~translationMissing
I've no idea really, this pot was a family heirloom. I guess you'd have to get a new one made?~|~translationMissing
Where could I do that?~|~translationMissing
You could try Tassie Slipcast over at the Barbarian Village. She's a potter there and may be able to make one. But mind, it has to be air tight.~|~translationMissing
Oh, no way am I going to the Barbarian Village.~|~translationMissing
I understand...they're all barbarians over there.~|~translationMissing
I guess I can go to the Barbarian Village.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful, I'd really appreciate it!~|~translationMissing
What about the breathing salts?~|~translationMissing
I smashed the pot which held them, remember?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes...where am I going to get a new pot?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the herbal tincture~|~translationMissing
I've lost that herbal tincture you gave me!~|~translationMissing
No problem, I'll just rustle up another one for you.~|~translationMissing
What was I supposed to be doing again?~|~translationMissing
Go and see Tassie in the Barbarian Village about making an airtight pot for me to store my breathing salts in, then you can take some for Horvik.~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes right!~|~translationMissing
Hey there...I need an airtight pot just as soon as you can make one!~|~translationMissing
Tassie Slipcast~|~translationMissing
I beg your pardon!~|~translationMissing
It's a matter of some urgency that I have an airtight container as soon as possible!~|~translationMissing
Who on earth do you think you are coming in here demanding an airtight pot...Can't you see that I have my own worries to think about?~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry, I didn't think...what's the problem?~|~translationMissing
Well, if you must know, I'm working all the hours that Saradomin sends, I have to in order to make enough money to pay that loan shark Hammerspike!~|~translationMissing
Loan shark? Hammerspike? What are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
I took over this abandoned pottery place with a loan from Hammerspike. He's demanding payment and I can barely just make the interest payments.~|~translationMissing
I'm working as hard as I can but I'll never pay the loan off at this rate!~|~translationMissing
But I need an airtight pot...to store breathing salts in.~|~translationMissing
Well, that may be, but I have a rush order for a top paying customer that's going to keep Hammerspike off my back for a bit.~|~translationMissing
If you really want that pot, you're going to have to deal with Hammerspike in the dwarven mines!~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll deal with Hammerspike!~|~translationMissing
Really, you will?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll go and have a chat with him, perhaps we can sort something out.~|~translationMissing
Well, that would be really great...I just hope he doesn't grind you into flour to make his bread, he's one of the most ruthless gangsters in the area.~|~translationMissing
Beware, his guards are incredibly loyal, they'll slit their own throats to protect him!~|~translationMissing
That's not a pretty picture you're painting, but don't worry, I'll be careful. Now, where do I find this Hammerspike?~|~translationMissing
He's in the dwarven mines somewhere, not sure exactly where though.~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, no more blooming favours for anyone!~|~translationMissing
Oh, well that's a real shame, I was hoping you could have sorted out that Hammerspike for me once and for all!~|~translationMissing
Hey there...I'm back...~|~translationMissing
So I see. What's the problem? Did you sort out Hammerspike?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly, can you tell me what I'm supposed to do again?~|~translationMissing
Go talk to Hammerspike in the Dwarven mines and see if you can get him to leave me alone...I won't be able to make you the airtight pot else.~|~translationMissing
Hammerspike Stoutbeard~|~translationMissing
And who da heck are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm [player name] and I want to talk to you about a friend of mine, Tassie Slipcast. She says you're putting the screws on her for some loan she had from you. Is this true?~|~translationMissing
And what if it is? Tassie got into an arrangement that is mutually beneficial, as far as I understood it, she was happy with the deal.~|~translationMissing
Well, I've come to change the deal!~|~translationMissing
Oh, so you wanna give me something for leaving Tassie alone?~|~translationMissing
Er...er...not exactly...why can't you just leave her alone? I mean, make a nice gesture, I'm asking out as a favour...please?~|~translationMissing
Can't you just leave Tassie alone?~|~translationMissing
Where would I be if I just left all of my 'customers' alone? Some people just need an extra 'encouragement' to make the best out of life...I'm just helping them along.~|~translationMissing
Oh, come on...do something nice for Tassie.~|~translationMissing
Oh, come on...do something nice for a[sic] Tassie. Think about how hard she's working!~|~translationMissing
Well...now that you come to mention it, I guess I have been a little hard on the girl.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, come on give her a break.~|~translationMissing
And I guess I am quite stressed about things, what with so much to think about recently.~|~translationMissing
I can understand that...you have a lot on your mind. Go on, make a change...it'll do you good! There must be something else that you wanted to do at least once in your life.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, yes, yes you're right...I did want to do something, something I noticed recently, but you'll laugh if I tell you...nah, it's silly.~|~translationMissing
Have you always been a gangster?~|~translationMissing
Have you always been a gangster? Wasn't there anything else that you wanted to do instead? Come on, tell me what you want to do...I'm listening.~|~translationMissing
Well, I was just thinking the other day that I'm feeling sort of unfulfilled in my life.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to get rid of all this anger and frustration that my current lifestyle brings and do something relaxing...like those druids, I mean, all day sitting around, looking at herbs and wearing robes and stuff.~|~translationMissing
Ok, that sounds good.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, yeah, I really want to be a druid...so...go and see the druid leader, I think Sanfew is his name, and persuade him to take me as an initiate. Do me this one small favour and I'll leave Tassie alone.~|~translationMissing
I don't think they take dwarven gangsters as initiates.~|~translationMissing
Whatever...I guess Tassie's gonna be working hard for a bit longer yet then!~|~translationMissing
Ok, another favour...I think I can manage that.~|~translationMissing
Good...I mean great! Come back when Sanfew has agreed to take me as an initiate!~|~translationMissing
And what's wrong now?~|~translationMissing
What was it that I was supposed to do for you?~|~translationMissing
Go and talk to Sanfew and get him to accept me as a druid initiate!~|~translationMissing
Are you taking any new initiates?~|~translationMissing
Are you taking any new initates?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, are you considering yourself?~|~translationMissing
How does someone become an initate?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, it's quite a straight-forward process. A person, perhaps like yourself, comes along to me and asks.~|~translationMissing
We test your knowledge of Herblore and see if you can fit in with the rest of us. If you pass, then we let you become an initiate.~|~translationMissing
Seems pretty straight forward!~|~translationMissing
Do you accept dwarves?~|~translationMissing
Dwarves? Well now, that's a mighty interesting question... Just because we haven't before, doesn't mean to say that we shouldn't.~|~translationMissing
A dwarf I know wants to become an initiate.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes? Well, that's interesting. Let me think for a moment. Hmmm... yes, actually, I don't mind taking him on, so long as you can do me just one small favour. Well, two actually.~|~translationMissing
Not you as well?~|~translationMissing
Stop interrupting me. I haven't told you about these favours!~|~translationMissing
There's a poor little gnome up on White Wolf mountain. I wondered if you could take him a warming herbal brew. I have the recipe here!~|~translationMissing
Well, that seems simple enough.~|~translationMissing
In addition...~|~translationMissing
I've long wished to take a trip down to see those ogres to the south of Yanille, and bring the word of Guthix to them. I was hoping you might organise this trip with the gnome pilot up there on White Wolf mountain.~|~translationMissing
Well, perhaps a bit... but it's never stopped you doing things for me before.~|~translationMissing
I've been asked to do a lot of favours recently.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's the life of an adventurer. Is it a deal, or not?~|~translationMissing
Yep, it's a deal.~|~translationMissing
Yep, it's a deal. Tell me the recipe for this herbal tea.~|~translationMissing
Ok, you need to heat some water up in a bowl, then pour it into an empty teacup. Add 1 harralander, 2 guam and 1 marrentill...it'll warm that poor fellow up a treat!~|~translationMissing
Mmm, sounds delicious! What's it called?~|~translationMissing
We call it 'Guthix's rest'.~|~translationMissing
Can I drink it?~|~translationMissing
If you want!~|~translationMissing
Great! And thanks.~|~translationMissing
But you'll have to make another one for the gnome.~|~translationMissing
But I can drink it though.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but you'll have to make another one for the gnome.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I think I understand.~|~translationMissing
Nope, it's not a deal!~|~translationMissing
Well, that's a shame. I was looking forward to visiting the ogres... Perhaps someday I will.~|~translationMissing
What did you need me to do again?~|~translationMissing
Make a herbal tea for the gnome and persuade him to take me to the ogre area, down to the south!~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, right, thanks!~|~translationMissing
How do I make the tea again?~|~translationMissing
I have a special tea here for you from Sanfew!~|~translationMissing
Captain Bleemadge~|~translationMissing
Ohhh! Many thanks! Brrr, blimey it's cold up here!~|~translationMissing
You hand over the cup of herbal tea.~|~translationMissing
(Guthix rest tea is removed from the inventory.)~|~translationMissing
Blimey, it was certainly jolly decent of that old stick Sanfew to get you to make me a cup of herbal tea. Wow! It really does chase away the chills!~|~translationMissing
Yes, he's quite considerate that way...you know, thinking of people. In fact, he was thinking that you may be able to help him with another little 'helping' situation that involves ogres.~|~translationMissing
Ogres!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well I guess they're just like overgrown gnomes when you think about it!~|~translationMissing
More like 'super-over-grown-gnomes' if you ask me! Or 'overgrown humans'!~|~translationMissing
Quite! Anyway, go on! What was Sanfew after?~|~translationMissing
Sanfew wants to bring the word of Guthix to those ogres, though I've no idea if ogres have the mental ability to grasp druidic concepts.~|~translationMissing
Yes, quite, but who amongst us does? I know I'm often confused by that beardy bunch of yakking druids.~|~translationMissing
Well, he wants to know if he can organise a glider ride down there.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, interesting! I know that the elders want to extend the network of glider routes, and I did hear that the Feldip Hills were being considered. I don't know why it hasn't opened up yet though.~|~translationMissing
If I'm going to transport that yakking druid down to the ogres I'll want to make it in record time so I'll need some lighter kit.~|~translationMissing
Ok, good luck with that.~|~translationMissing
There's a chap called Arhein in Catherby and I've heard that his special interest in ships has helped him to produce lightweight but strengthened ropes. I'm in need of some T.R.A.S.H.! And I need you to get it for me.~|~translationMissing
TRASH? What the demonikin are you talking about? Why do I have to get it?~|~translationMissing
I'm talking about the next generation of lightweight ropes. Triple Redundant Aero Super Hawser...T.R.A.S.H.! I'll transport your yakking druid if you can get me some T.R.A.S.H!~|~translationMissing
And you have to get it because I have to stay here with this glider. Is it a deal?~|~translationMissing
Go to Arhein and ask him for some T.R.A.S.H....~|~translationMissing
What is T.R.A.S.H?~|~translationMissing
T.R.A.S.H. is a short way of saying, 'Triple Redundant Aero Super Hawser', it's a technical term that we gnomes like to use when specifying lightweight rope.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get this from?~|~translationMissing
Go and talk to a chap called Arhein in Catherby, he's developed it so he'll know exactly what you're talking about.~|~translationMissing
Great! So I get to talk T.R.A.S.H with shopkeepers!~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go and get you some T.R.A.S.H.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful my friend, wonderful!~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, I can't do it right now.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's a bit of a shame...I was looking forward to upgrading my glider!~|~translationMissing
How was that tea?~|~translationMissing
It was delicious thanks!~|~translationMissing
Go to Arhein in Catherby and get some T.R.A.S.H! That's a short name for Triple Redundant Aero Super Hawser and then bring it back to me! I mean, it's not difficult is it?~|~translationMissing
Arhein~|~translationMissing
Hello! Would you like to trade?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Is that your ship?~|~translationMissing
I need to talk T.R.A.S.H to you.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, well it won't be the first time...but just so I'm sure can you explain what you mean?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course. There's a Gnome on White Wolf mountain who needs some T.R.A.S.H...for his glider...do you have some?~|~translationMissing
Well, I've done a lot of research into Triple Redundant Aero Super Hawsers and it seems to have paid off, but answer me this one question. Why are you asking me this rather than the Gnome?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm sort of doing him a favour.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, really, is that so? Well, I do have some Triple Redundant Aero Super Hawser and I'll let you have some if you do me just one small favour.~|~translationMissing
How totally unpredictable!~|~translationMissing
No, this is a really quick thing and shouldn't take you longer than a few minutes.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I've heard that before! Go on...tell me anyway.~|~translationMissing
I'm funding a rather expensive trade run to Brimhaven soon and I want to be sure that the weather isn't going to change and cause my ships any trouble.~|~translationMissing
The last thing I need is a load of goods going straight to the bottom of the ocean.~|~translationMissing
Well, I can understand that.~|~translationMissing
I just need you to pop along to Seers Village and ask those philosophers of foresight for a weather report. I believe a new seer there called Phantuwti can help you.~|~translationMissing
No way...I've had enough of this wild goose chase.~|~translationMissing
Yes, Ok, I'll do it!~|~translationMissing
That's great, many thanks.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Hello, what is this place?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have any quests?~|~translationMissing
Hi, can you give me a weather forecast?~|~translationMissing
Phantuwti Fanstuwi Farsight~|~translationMissing
Hmm, somehow I knew you were going to ask me that...strange...life is so predictable when you have the power of foresight.~|~translationMissing
Great! So I can assume you've been really pro-active and compiled an up-to-date one for me?~|~translationMissing
Alas my presumptuous friend, the power of foresight and the impulse to act is quite similar to the interplay between intelligence and wisdom.~|~translationMissing
One might have intelligence enough to realise that cakes are bad for us, but we may not have the wisdom to stop cramming that delicious-looking fatty cream cake into our salivating mouth.~|~translationMissing
So, in your case, you have the power of foresight, but you're too lazy to act on it?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly lazy...but unable. My abilities and concern have been focused on the fate of a local girl whose association with a certain wizard has landed her between a rock and hard place.~|~translationMissing
Who is this girl that you're concerned about?~|~translationMissing
The girl's name is Petra, she's a very ...energetic youngster, always wanted to travel and have adventures. When she turned seventeen she set off to earn herself fame and fortune.~|~translationMissing
It looks like she's ended up in a bit of a dead end position...~|~translationMissing
Where is this girl?~|~translationMissing
It's quite difficult to pinpoint exactly where she is, but apparently she's in some sort of cavern structure.~|~translationMissing
We sense that there are other beings around her, smelly creatures, and some sort of presence is watching over her.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any ideas where that might be? I mean, it's pretty vague isn't it?~|~translationMissing
Well, we believe it may be some sort of nearby cave, it can't be very far away as the impressions we get are quite strong. We believe the cave is a home for some sort of creature or creatures.~|~translationMissing
What do you think needs to be done?~|~translationMissing
Well, it would be nice to locate her...if possible. Then we may be able to work out what to do when we can see what sort of state she's in.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry but I can't help.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's a bit of a shame, I have to say...we all miss our Petra!~|~translationMissing
Do you think you could do me a small favour? Check around the vicinity. The impressions are coming from a south westerly direction.~|~translationMissing
Don't go further east than you are already, no further south than Ardougne and no further west than the combat training camp.~|~translationMissing
So, let me get this right. You want me to start poking my nose into a lot of caves where some creatures might be?~|~translationMissing
Risking my neck for some tomboy who thinks she's got what it takes to be a real adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Well, I wouldn't have put it quite that way...~|~translationMissing
Yes, Ok, I'll do it.~|~translationMissing
Great! I just knew you'd agree to help!~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, I can't do it right now. Or maybe ever!~|~translationMissing
I knew you wouldn't help...oh well, perhaps someday you'll surprise me.~|~translationMissing
I need you to start checking nearby caves looking for our missing Petra. The caves are probably home to some creature or creatures. Check around the vicincity.~|~translationMissing
The impressions are coming from a south westerly direction. Don't go further east than you are already, no further south than Ardougne and no further west than the combat training camp.~|~translationMissing
You search the life-like sculpture and see what looks like a message sticking out of the girl's belt. It reads,'...problems report to Wizard Cromp.....rently in residence in East Ardoug...~|~translationMissing
Wizard Cromperty~|~translationMissing
Hello there. My name is Cromperty. I am a wizard, and an inventor.~|~translationMissing
You must be [player name]. My good friend Sedridor has told me about you. As both wizard and inventor, he has aided me in my great invention!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Two jobs? That's got to be tough.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) So what have you invented?~|~translationMissing
I need to talk to you about a girl stuck in some rock!~|~translationMissing
Eh!~|~translationMissing
What? I have no clue what you're talking about! Now, please excuse me! I need to get back to my experiments!~|~translationMissing
Hey! Not so fast! I've seen a young girl encased in rock, a note in her belt led me to you.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, it's such a bother getting them back out of the rock walls and I do loathe the trip to Port Khazard for the components.~|~translationMissing
What the demonikin are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's not the first time someone's been teleported into a rock face, just the slightest miscalculation and bang...they're in the wall!~|~translationMissing
It's fairly straightforward to cast a spell and fish them out again - but it requires a spell component from a chap in Port Khazard.~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you could do me a small favour could you?~|~translationMissing
Just one small favour? Pop along to Port Khazard and get some iron oxide, it's a component of the spell.~|~translationMissing
No way am I going to Port Khazard for you!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, what a shame...I just don't have time to deal with this now...she's safe where she is for now, and I'm sure I'll get to it sooner or later.~|~translationMissing
Oh! Ok, one more 'small favour' isn't going to kill me...I hope!~|~translationMissing
Waaahaaay! Great! I'd never suspect you'd be so helpful!~|~translationMissing
You need to talk to a chap called Tindel Marchant in Port Khazard, he's sort of like an antiques dealer.~|~translationMissing
Well, off you go then! A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step and all that!~|~translationMissing
What? Are you saying I have to travel a thousand miles?~|~translationMissing
Of course not...you silly...just...you know...the sooner you start the sooner you can get back...that's all I was saying.~|~translationMissing
Go to Port Khazard and get me some iron oxide from Tindel Marchant.~|~translationMissing
Tindel Marchant~|~translationMissing
Hello there! Welcome to my special antiques boutique.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Chat about Antiques store.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Cromperty sent me to get some iron oxide.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Cromperty sent me to get some iron oxide. Do you have some?~|~translationMissing
As a matter of fact, I do! However, it's the last in stock and I'm not likely to get more for a while so it's highly prized amongst the wizards at the moment.~|~translationMissing
It's not easy to get so much rust together, even if I do come across it more often than most people with cleaning these rusty swords up!~|~translationMissing
Rust? What do you mean? How much does it cost?~|~translationMissing
Yes, iron oxide is more commonly referred to as rust. As for a price, hmmm...well...let me think now...I could give it to you for the price of...~|~translationMissing
One small favour!~|~translationMissing
Groan!!!~|~translationMissing
I need a nice mattress to sleep on! I haven't had a decent night's sleep in an ice-age...could you take this stodgy mattress down to Rantz in the ogre area and ask him to fill it with prime chompy bird feathers please?~|~translationMissing
So, let me get this straight.~|~translationMissing
You want me to traipse ALL the way down past the ogre city with some flea infested mattress, to some hermit ogre, who can't shoot a chompy bird to save his life, so that you'll give me a pot of rust?~|~translationMissing
Well, er, I wouldn't have said it quite that way...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll do it!~|~translationMissing
Great, many thanks indeed! Here's the mattress!~|~translationMissing
Tindel gives you a worn out, very poor-looking mattress.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I just don't want to do it.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's a shame, but come back and see me if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
You need to take that stodgy mattress I gave you to Rantz and ask him to fill it with feathers! Then, bring it back to me and I'll give you some iron oxide.~|~translationMissing
Oh, okay then!~|~translationMissing
Erm, I've lost the mattress...~|~translationMissing
Erm, I've lost the mattress... do you have another one I can get refilled?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but I had to pay for this myself so you'd better pay me for losing my last one...it cost 100 gold!~|~translationMissing
Okay, here's 100 coins for another mattress...~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks a lot, here's the mattress!~|~translationMissing
Tindel gives you a new, old mattress!~|~translationMissing
I'm not paying you 100 coins for that stinky mattress.~|~translationMissing
Well, don't expect your iron oxide any time soon then!~|~translationMissing
Okay, then I won't.~|~translationMissing
Good!~|~translationMissing
Get out!~|~translationMissing
GLADLY!~|~translationMissing
Grrrr!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) General conversation.~|~translationMissing
I need to talk to you about a mattress.~|~translationMissing
I need to talk to you about a mattress!~|~translationMissing
You's creature shuvs flapper sack in rantz face, making rantz very upset~|~translationMissing
Can you fill this mattress with feathers?~|~translationMissing
Der's no flappers to get cos da little guy scares dem away wiv his banging. He's making da man flapper 'come-down-place' and it's takin' ages and ages.~|~translationMissing
Da chompies don't come no more since he's banging all da time.~|~translationMissing
What's going on around here?~|~translationMissing
Da little guy, he's making da man flapper 'come-down-place'...so deyz more of yous creatures coming to see Rantz...but he's takin ages to do it.~|~translationMissing
What can I do about that?~|~translationMissing
You's can help da little guy, he's over der near da ogre city...he's stuck wiv sumfing, making da man flapper 'come-down-place'. Me's not doin' no chompy hunting wiv dat noise going on.~|~translationMissing
Dat would be da good find...den me's help wiv da flufsies sack.~|~translationMissing
Yous creature, go see little guy and help wiv da man flapper 'come-down-place'...den Rantz helps yous creature wiv da fluffsies sack.~|~translationMissing
Gnormadium Avlafrim~|~translationMissing
Hello! Don't get in the way around here, we've got a lot of work to do!~|~translationMissing
Hello there, what are you working on?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's quite exciting... we're extending the glider network to include the Feldip Hills so that people can come and look at these curious ogres.~|~translationMissing
They are impressive creatures aren't they - quite mystified they are by the technology we gnomes have invented.~|~translationMissing
What are you working on?~|~translationMissing
Well, people will be able to visit this area, once construction has finished, by using the most advanced network of glider routes in the whole of Gielinor... in fact, the only network of glider routes!~|~translationMissing
Is there anything that I can do?~|~translationMissing
Not really, I'm afraid, it's probably all far too technical for someone like you.~|~translationMissing
Rantz said I should help you finish this project.~|~translationMissing
Rantz? *gulp* Well, that would be nice actually! We are having some problems with getting the landing lights to work... do you think you could take a look at them?~|~translationMissing
I expect that it's far too complex for you, but hey, you may be able to do something!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll take a look at them.~|~translationMissing
Ok then, just pop over and let me know if you're not sure what you're doing... I'm sure I'll just have to fix it myself anyway. If you need any materials, just pop over.~|~translationMissing
We'll see!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I've got other things to attend to.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I expected it might be a bit too complex for you. We Gnomes lead the way with technical things like this - world leaders, you might say.~|~translationMissing
What was it you wanted me to do again?~|~translationMissing
Go and take a look at those landing lights and see if you can get them to work, would you? They've been as dull as an ogre conversation since we started working here.~|~translationMissing
Come back and tell me if you actually manage to get them fixed.~|~translationMissing
Depending on which Gnome landing light is searched~|~translationMissing
You find an uncut sapphire in the landing light.~|~translationMissing
You find an uncut opal in the landing light.~|~translationMissing
You find an uncut red topaz in the landing light.~|~translationMissing
You find an uncut jade in the landing light.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything I can do?~|~translationMissing
I need a chisel to fix these crystals.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I can sell you one for 10 coins.~|~translationMissing
Without the right amount of coins in inventory~|~translationMissing
But I don't have 10 coins.~|~translationMissing
So I can't sell you one then!~|~translationMissing
With at least 10 coins in inventory~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll buy a chisel for 10 coins.~|~translationMissing
You pay ten coins for the chisel.~|~translationMissing
Okay, many thanks for your custom.~|~translationMissing
No, I won't buy the chisel.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, come back if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
I need a new [opal/jade/red topaz] to fix the lights.~|~translationMissing
Broken something, have you? I'll want 500 coins for a new one. Be careful - my supplies are limited, and if I run out, you'll have to find your own materials elsewhere.~|~translationMissing
But I don't have 500 coins!~|~translationMissing
I can't give you one then.~|~translationMissing
With at least 500 coins in inventory~|~translationMissing
Okay, here's 500 coins, I'll buy one.~|~translationMissing
You hand over 500 coins for the [opal/jade/red topaz].~|~translationMissing
No way am I paying that much.~|~translationMissing
You place the sapphire in the landing light. It seems to look right.~|~translationMissing
You place the opal in the landing light. It seems to look right.~|~translationMissing
You place the red topaz in the landing light. It seems to look right.~|~translationMissing
You place the jade in the landing light. It seems to look right.~|~translationMissing
Depending on how many lights have been fixed~|~translationMissing
You've fixed one landing light so far...~|~translationMissing
You've fixed 2 landing lights so far...~|~translationMissing
You've fixed 3 landing lights so far...~|~translationMissing
You've fixed 4 landing lights so far...~|~translationMissing
You've fixed 5 landing lights so far...~|~translationMissing
You've fixed 6 landing lights so far...~|~translationMissing
You've fixed 7 landing lights so far...~|~translationMissing
You've fixed all the landing lights!~|~translationMissing
I've fixed all the lights!~|~translationMissing
Hmm. That seems a tad unlikely to me, but let's flick the switch here and see, shall we?!~|~translationMissing
Cutscene plays of the lights being turned on.~|~translationMissing
I don't believe it - you fixed it! Well done, well done... We can pack up now and leave these ogres in peace.~|~translationMissing
I know one ogre who'll be very pleased about that!~|~translationMissing
Ok, I've helped that Gnome, he shouldn't bother you anymore.~|~translationMissing
Yous creature dun a gud fing...Rantz give yous creature da fluffsies sack now...~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the Stodgy mattress~|~translationMissing
But I don't have the stodgy mattress anymore...I'll have to get another one.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Stodgy mattress~|~translationMissing
Rantz gives you a filled comfy mattress.~|~translationMissing
De're yous goes creature...da fluffsies sack is full now.~|~translationMissing
Great, I think Tindel will get a good night's rest on this.~|~translationMissing
I've lost that filled mattress you gave me!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a stodgy mattress~|~translationMissing
Yous creature needs to bring me da saggy fluffsies sack to full wiv da chompy flufsies!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a stodgy mattress~|~translationMissing
It cost you dis many bright pretties to do dis again, yous den be more careful wiv my work next time round.~|~translationMissing
Rantz flashes his fingers at you many times, you think he wantsabout 200 gold. ~~|~translationMissing
If the player doesnt' have enough coins~|~translationMissing
But I don't have that many bright pretties!~|~translationMissing
Den yous no get da fluffsies sack...~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 200 coins~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll give you 200 bright pretties.~|~translationMissing
Rantz gives you a new comfy mattress.~|~translationMissing
De're yous goes creatures...dere's yous comfy fluffsies sack.~|~translationMissing
No way am I giving you 200 bright pretties.~|~translationMissing
I have the mattress.~|~translationMissing
I have the mattress!~|~translationMissing
Great! Let's have a look then.~|~translationMissing
You hand Tindel the comfy mattress. Tindel gives you the iron oxide.~|~translationMissing
Great! Here's the iron oxide I promised you!~|~translationMissing
I've lost the iron oxide, can I have some more?~|~translationMissing
Okay, but I'm going to have to charge you I'm afraid. 200 coins.~|~translationMissing
But I haven't got 200 coins!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I have to make a living.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll buy it.~|~translationMissing
You pay 200 coins for another bottle of rust.~|~translationMissing
No way am I paying 200 coins for a bottle of rust!~|~translationMissing
Suit yourself... I have plenty of other customers.~|~translationMissing
I have that iron oxide you asked for!~|~translationMissing
Great! Just what I needed! Now I need to give you a spell scroll to help bring Petra back again.~|~translationMissing
Cromperty takes the iron oxide and starts preparing a spell.~|~translationMissing
After some time, he comes back and gives you an animate rock spell.~|~translationMissing
Just cast this in the room, it should have her out of that rock in a jiffy! Good luck with your exploits...now, where was I with that wranklin severance device...~|~translationMissing
I need another animate rock spell.~|~translationMissing
I suspected that you might...you can have one, but it will cost you 100 gold pieces.~|~translationMissing
But I don't have 100 coins!~|~translationMissing
So you can't have the spell then can you!~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 100 coins~|~translationMissing
No way...I'm cleaning up your mess, you should be grateful!~|~translationMissing
Well, I did give you the last one for free...you're not getting another one for free, even if it is my mess that you're trying to clear up! You shouldn't be so careless to leave things lying around!~|~translationMissing
Ok, here you go!~|~translationMissing
Thanks...try not to lose it this time.~|~translationMissing
Grrrrr!~|~translationMissing
Um nahi listic durooo-rah!~|~translationMissing
Whoooah! That was a bit of a misfire.~|~translationMissing
And this doesn't look good!~|~translationMissing
Petra Fiyed~|~translationMissing
Oh thank goodness you released me...how long have I been stuck in that gloomy wall?~|~translationMissing
Oh, not so long...I don't think...~|~translationMissing
I mean...that is... I'm not so sure...at all...in fact.~|~translationMissing
Well, at least I'm ok...thanks to you! Last time I get involved with that Cromperty lunatic...in fact I have some words to say to that man!~|~translationMissing
Well actually, I think that some of the people at the Seers Village are worried about you. That's how I came to find you here, Phantuwti sent me.~|~translationMissing
Oh, right, yes, well I guess I'd better go back there and let them all know that I'm safe then..Ok, thanks...I'll be off now and once again thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
No problem...I'll probably see you back at the Seers Village.~|~translationMissing
I've released Petra, she should have returned.~|~translationMissing
Hi there, yes she has actually! Well done, you're a true hero!~|~translationMissing
So, can I have the weather report now please?~|~translationMissing
I wish I could but it's just been so difficult to get a clear image of the future at the moment. You know...we're all so relieved that Petra has returned and all that.~|~translationMissing
Listen you...just give me the blooming weather report!~|~translationMissing
Er...no. I can't, I told you, I can't get a clear picture. Nope, sorry, the conditions are just not quite right.~|~translationMissing
Why can't you get a clear picture?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's just like that Ok, I just can't get a clear picture...and that's it.~|~translationMissing
I've done my part of the deal, now hand over that weather report.~|~translationMissing
I would really like to, please believe me, I would, but I just can't.~|~translationMissing
I'll run you through if you don't give me that weather report.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's not very nice...I mean, I'm a nice guy and I thought you were nice too! Why would you want to run me through? I mean, it's only a weather report.~|~translationMissing
It doesn't make sense to get angry about something so trivial.~|~translationMissing
You're making me angry! I did you a favour, now pay up!~|~translationMissing
I'm not making you angry, you're doing all that on your own! I just don't have a weather report to give you!~|~translationMissing
I can't help that, you should be more understanding and less forceful, then I might be persuaded to give you the weather report.~|~translationMissing
Well, it's complicated, the special Seers tools that help us predict the weather are not aligned properly...~|~translationMissing
Which special Seers tools do you mean?~|~translationMissing
Well, we use a special combination of items which are used to gauge current weather movements and we're able to predict future weather patterns from these. Of course, it's strongly linked to the Seers' foresight ability.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean, 'special combination of items'?~|~translationMissing
Well, let me think now...There's a copper eye, a rotating thing, and some pointy direction thingies. It's all highly scientific - and of course mystical - in a very magical 'foresight' sort of way.~|~translationMissing
You're talking about a weather vane aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Er...maybe...I may be talking about that...~|~translationMissing
You can't predict the weather because your weather vane is broken...that's it isn't it? Holy Saradomin breath....you can't even predict the weather, you need a weather vane!~|~translationMissing
Erm, well....err....~|~translationMissing
Ok, show me where this weather vane is...I want to look at it.~|~translationMissing
I may be able to fix it and then you can give me a weather report...come on, let's go!~|~translationMissing
Oh, very well..but you'll need to be a specialist to fix this weather vane, it was made by some of the most experienced....~|~translationMissing
Just show me it!~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok, it's up on the roof...~|~translationMissing
You're talking in riddles, just give me a straight answer!~|~translationMissing
Since when has any Seer ever given you a straight answer...the power of knowing the future and the visions we see have to be wrapped in allegory so that the truth can slowly be accepted by the listener.~|~translationMissing
This isn't allegory though, you're just avoiding my questions!~|~translationMissing
How can you be sure? Are you so sure of what you just asked me? And am I really avoiding your questions by asking you lots of other questions? Answer me that huh!~|~translationMissing
Anyway, we need a special combination of items before we can truly have foreknowledge of the weather.~|~translationMissing
How hard can it be to predict the weather?~|~translationMissing
Quite hard actually. I mean, you're still waiting for me to do it aren't you and I've told you time and again that I can't...right now...but that normally it's actually quite an easy thing for me to do.~|~translationMissing
Ok, what's it going to take to get a weather report?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well, you can come back in several months and see if we can do one for you....does that help?~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, it doesn't help at all, I need a weather report and I need it now...so hand it over!~|~translationMissing
You're just a fake...you can't predict the weather!~|~translationMissing
What's it going to take for you to give me that weather report?~|~translationMissing
Why...how dare you...I've never been so insulted in my life.~|~translationMissing
You should get out more!~|~translationMissing
What's it going to take for you to give me that weather report.~|~translationMissing
Well, nothing in fact, as I can't give you a weather report. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.~|~translationMissing
I've fixed the weather vane!~|~translationMissing
Oh, thanks so much...you can't believe how helpful it is to get accurate predictions on the weather...we Seers are almost blind without it.~|~translationMissing
Phantuwti starts compiling a weather report for you.~|~translationMissing
There you go...a weather report as asked for...I hope it helps you!~|~translationMissing
I have the weather report for you.~|~translationMissing
Fantastic...let's see it!~|~translationMissing
You show the weather report to Arhein.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful...well the weather report is slightly unspecific, but I feel much better anyway for getting it. Hopefully now the Seers will take some responsibility if my ships go down to the bottom of the ocean.~|~translationMissing
I'll get one of my associates to take some T.R.A.S.H to your Gnome Glider Pilot friend on White Wolf mountain. Once again, many thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
Hey there, did you get your T.R.A.S.H?~|~translationMissing
Hey there, did you get your T.R.A.S.H? Arhein said that he'd send one of this[sic] associates up with it.~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes, thanks...I've already installed it. I should go like the wind now! Tell Sanfew, that yakking old druid, I'll be happy to take him to the ogre area now...and yourself of course if you should like to go.~|~translationMissing
Ok then...thanks I will!~|~translationMissing
Hi there, the Gnome Pilot has agreed to take you to see the ogres!~|~translationMissing
Hi there, the gnome Pilot has agreed to take you to see the ogres!~|~translationMissing
What's that? He's agreed to take me...well that's wonderful! Many thanks.~|~translationMissing
Please tell that dwarf that he's welcome to come here and train to be an initiate.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you! Back are you then?~|~translationMissing
Yep and with good news...your life is about to change for the better. I've persuaded Sanfew to take you in as an initiate!~|~translationMissing
Ha, ha ha ha! How funny is that! I've gone and changed my mind now! I've decided that I make a far better gangster than I ever would a druid!~|~translationMissing
My men are going to deal with you!~|~translationMissing
(Hammerspike's men attack the player.)~|~translationMissing
Well...sure if you're not full of surprises then...I guess I'll have to either hire more men to try and kill you or forget Tassie's loan.~|~translationMissing
Ok, you promise me that you won't bother Tassie anymore and I'll leave you alone.~|~translationMissing
Ok then, fair enough....I'll leave her alone...but I'm going to deal with you personally one of these days!~|~translationMissing
I'll be ready for you whenever you want to take a shot Hammerspike...I'm not afraid of you! You're just a bully who can't fight his own battles.~|~translationMissing
Hey there, Hammerspike won't be bothering you anymore!~|~translationMissing
Really! Fantastic! Oh, I'm so grateful! Thanks so much! How ever can I repay you?~|~translationMissing
Well you could make me an airtight pot!~|~translationMissing
I'll do better than that! I'll show you how to make an airtight pot! First of all, you'll need some clay...here's some I have spare!~|~translationMissing
Now, while pots are quite easy to make, lids are a bit different. They have to be quite precise to fit the pot exactly, which is why you have to be quite experienced to make them.~|~translationMissing
Tassie gives you some clay!~|~translationMissing
Ok then, just use it on the wheel over there!~|~translationMissing
Tassie shows you how to make pot lids.~|~translationMissing
Hey there! I have an airtight pot for you!~|~translationMissing
Wonderful, let me see!~|~translationMissing
You show the Apothecary the airtight pot.~|~translationMissing
Huzzah! You have an airtight pot! Wonderful! Ok, let me get some breathing salts into this thing for you!~|~translationMissing
The Apothecary busily fills the airtight pot and then quickly seals the lid.~|~translationMissing
That's great! Many thanks friend...here's your breathing salts!~|~translationMissing
The Apothecary gives you a pot of breathing salts.~|~translationMissing
I have the herbal tincture.~|~translationMissing
Well that's no good, I need the breathing salts as well!~|~translationMissing
I have the breathing salts.~|~translationMissing
Well that's no good, I need the tincture as well!~|~translationMissing
I have the tincture and breathing salts.~|~translationMissing
Great! Let's have a look at them then!~|~translationMissing
(Herbal tincture and breathing salts are removed from the player's inventory.)~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! That's just great! I just need the pigeon cages now.~|~translationMissing
I need you to get me five pigeon cages, apparently you can get them from Ardougne. When I have them, I can convert them into chicken cages for you.~|~translationMissing
I have the five pigeon cages you asked for!~|~translationMissing
Great stuff...let's have them here then! Ah, I can turn my hand to a bit of woodworking on these, great, I do it as a hobby.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the pigeon cages.~|~translationMissing
Horvik works for sometime on the pigeon cages and makes several minor adjustments. Eventually, he comes back to you.~|~translationMissing
(The Pigeon cages in the player's inventory are replaced with Chicken cages.)~|~translationMissing
There you go then! There's your chicken cages!~|~translationMissing
I have some chicken cages!~|~translationMissing
Well, I need at least five! Come back when you've got that many!~|~translationMissing
Here they are! I've got all five!~|~translationMissing
You show Seth the chicken cages.~|~translationMissing
(Chicken cages are removed from the player's inventory.)~|~translationMissing
Well that's great! Well done! You can go and talk to those fanatics now and tell them that they'll get their chickens and they can let little Jimmy the Chisel go! Once again, thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for getting us those chicken cages...you can go and talk to those fanatics now and get Jimmy released.~|~translationMissing
You're in luck, I've managed to swing that chicken deal for you.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Congratulations on your achievement, your help will ensure the success of our venture and we can surely take our efforts forwards. Tell me, won't you consider joining our calling?~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the offer, but I'm sort of in the middle of something currently.~|~translationMissing
Right...well please consider it an open offer...Ok then...thanks and goodbye.~|~translationMissing
Hold on! Aren't you forgetting something?~|~translationMissing
What? Sorry? Please calm down!~|~translationMissing
You said that you would release Jimmy! Are you going to keep to your word or am I going to have to get angry?~|~translationMissing
Oh my dear friend...please...there's no need to get so upset...of course we're going to release Jimmy. Oh dear, you do take things a bit seriously don't you?~|~translationMissing
Good...I have things to do and I've had enough of people messing me about.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I understand...please don't worry. I'll release Brother Jimmy now! Tell his employer that he'll be there shortly.~|~translationMissing
Very well...but if you're lying, I'll be back and I won't be happy!~|~translationMissing
Good news! Jimmy has been released!~|~translationMissing
Good news! Jimmy has been released by those fanatical HAM people! He said he was on his way back here!~|~translationMissing
Yes! He's just returned! I'll happily be a character witness for Brian now! Please let him know that I'll help his friend however I can.~|~translationMissing
I've returned with good news.~|~translationMissing
I've returned with good news. Aggie has agreed to be your character witness!~|~translationMissing
Well, I wish I could be more happy, but I've just had some bad news.~|~translationMissing
Well, it seems that my friend was even more desperate than I had originally realised. He's gone to hide away from the authorities in the wilderness...what a lunatic!~|~translationMissing
I've heard that he's wandered into the lava maze in the most dangerous part of the wilderness!~|~translationMissing
Well...what's going to happen now?~|~translationMissing
Well, I was wondering if you could do me just one small favour? Please could you go and fetch him back again for me?~|~translationMissing
You have got to be kidding!~|~translationMissing
Well....yes...I was....actually!~|~translationMissing
Brian hands you the sharpened axe.~|~translationMissing
Here you go, here's your axe! And very many thanks for your help and a good laugh! You should have seen your face! Oh what a picture!~|~translationMissing
Good news, I have your sharpened axe!~|~translationMissing
Ah, great!~|~translationMissing
Yep, here it is... at long last!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, you've been a while... I mean, I could have just gone and done it myself! It probably wouldn't have taken so long.~|~translationMissing
Why you ungrateful...~|~translationMissing
Hang on a minute... there's no need to get so angry. Here's that red mahogany you wanted.~|~translationMissing
The jungle forester shows you the red mahogany log.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Sharpened axe.)~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Red mahogany log.)~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks for getting my axe sharpened for me!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How do I get into the Kharazi jungle?~|~translationMissing
Here's the red mahogany you asked for.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's absolutely wonderful my friend! Many thanks!~|~translationMissing
Wait, that's it?~|~translationMissing
Well...what were you expecting? I mean, it took you so long I could have gone and got it myself!~|~translationMissing
What! I've traipsed halfway around Gielinor...~|~translationMissing
I've negociated with fanatics, dwarven gangsters and arrogant gnomes.~|~translationMissing
I've fixed ancient weather vanes and gnomish landing lights and fought supernatural rock monsters...~|~translationMissing
I've filled stodgy mattresses with feathers, made pot lids to help cure an ailing metal-smith...and that's all the thanks I get? 'Thanks!'~|~translationMissing
Well, you didn't have to go to so much trouble...~|~translationMissing
Raarrrhhhh!~|~translationMissing
Look, I can see that you're quite upset about this...so here, have this.~|~translationMissing
Yanni shows you a small metallic ring.~|~translationMissing
It's a key ring, you can store some of your most valuable keys on it...helps to keep things organised!~|~translationMissing
A key ring? That's it?~|~translationMissing
Well, I only asked you to do me one small favour...~|~translationMissing
Groan! Yeah, so did everyone else!~|~translationMissing
Oh....ok, I guess I could offer you these lamps...I'm not sure what they're worth, but you can have them.~|~translationMissing
Yanni offers you two unusual looking lamps.~|~translationMissing

Arr, Matey!~|~translationMissing
I'm in search of treasure.~|~translationMissing
Arr, treasure you be after eh? Well I might be able to tell you where to find some... For a price...~|~translationMissing
What sort of price?~|~translationMissing
Well for example if you can get me a bottle of rum... Not just any rum mind...~|~translationMissing
I'd like some rum made on Karamja Island. There's no rum like Karamja Rum!~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Rum Deal~|~translationMissing
Would some Braindeath 'Rum' do?~|~translationMissing
Gadzooks, that swill! Not a chance!~|~translationMissing
It's Karamja Rum or no deal.~|~translationMissing
Start the Pirate's Treasure quest?~|~translationMissing
Ok, I will bring you some rum.~|~translationMissing
Yer a saint, although it'll take a miracle to get it off Karamja.~|~translationMissing
The Customs office has been clampin' down on the export of spirits. You seem like a resourceful young [lad/lass], I'm sure ye'll be able to find a way to slip the stuff past them.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll give it a shot.~|~translationMissing
Arr, that's the spirit!~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. I'll still be here and thirsty whenever you feel like helpin' out.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Arr!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have anything for trade?~|~translationMissing

Luthas~|~translationMissing
Hello I'm Luthas, I run the banana plantation here.~|~translationMissing
Could you offer me employment on your plantation?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I can sort something out. There's a crate ready to be loaded onto the ship.~|~translationMissing
You wouldn't believe the demand for bananas from Wydin's shop over in Port Sarim. I think this is the third crate I've shipped him this month..~|~translationMissing
If you could fill it up with bananas, I'll pay you 30 gold.~|~translationMissing
That customs officer is annoying isn't she?~|~translationMissing
Well I know her pretty well. She doesn't cause me any trouble any more.~|~translationMissing
She doesn't even search my export crates any more. She knows they only contain bananas.~|~translationMissing
Really? How interesting. Whereabouts do you send those to?~|~translationMissing
There is a little shop over in Port Sarim that buys them up by the crate. I believe it is run by a man called Wydin.~|~translationMissing
You fill the crate with bananas.~|~translationMissing
You stash the rum in the crate.~|~translationMissing
Pirates don't usually take banana with their Karamjan rum.~|~translationMissing
Pirates don't usually take sliced banana with their Karamjan rum.~|~translationMissing
The crate is full of bananas.~|~translationMissing
If the player has hidden a rum bottle in the crate~|~translationMissing
There is also some rum stashed in here too.~|~translationMissing
I've filled a crate with bananas.~|~translationMissing
Well done, here's your payment.~|~translationMissing
(The player receives 30 coins. If they talk to Luthas again or wait a short while.)~|~translationMissing
Will you pay me for another crate full?~|~translationMissing
Yes certainly.~|~translationMissing
If you go outside you should see the old crate has been loaded on to the ship, and there is another empty crate in its place.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, I'll be on my way~|~translationMissing
Thank you, I'll be on my way.~|~translationMissing
So where are these bananas going to be delivered to?~|~translationMissing
I sell them to Wydin who runs a grocery store in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
Customs officer~|~translationMissing
Can I journey on this ship?~|~translationMissing
You need to be searched before you can board.~|~translationMissing
Because Asgarnia has banned the import of intoxicating spirits.~|~translationMissing
Search away, I have nothing to hide.~|~translationMissing
If the player has Karamjan rum~|~translationMissing
Aha, trying to smuggle rum are we?~|~translationMissing
Umm... it's for personal use?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have Karamjan rum~|~translationMissing
Well you've got some odd stuff, but it's all legal. Now you need to pay a boarding charge of 30 coins.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 30 coins~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I don't seem to have enough money.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'll not bother then.~|~translationMissing
You're not putting your hands on my things!~|~translationMissing
You're not getting on this ship then.~|~translationMissing
Does Karamja have unusual customs then?~|~translationMissing
Does Karamja have any unusual customs then?~|~translationMissing
I'm not that sort of customs officer.~|~translationMissing
Wydin~|~translationMissing
Welcome to my food store! Would you like to buy anything?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What can you recommend?~|~translationMissing
Can I get a job here?~|~translationMissing
Well, you're keen, I'll give you that. Okay, I'll give you a go. Have you got your own white apron?~|~translationMissing
If the player has a white apron~|~translationMissing
Wow - you are well prepared! You're hired. Go through to the back and tidy up for me, please.~|~translationMissing
If the white apron is not equipped~|~translationMissing
You need to put your white apron on first though.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a white apron~|~translationMissing
No, I haven't.~|~translationMissing
Well, you can't work here unless you have a white apron. Health and safety regulations, you understand.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get one of those?~|~translationMissing
Well, I get all of mine over at the clothing shop in Varrock. They sell them cheap there.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and I'm sure that I've seen a spare one over in Gerrant's fish store somewhere. It's the little place just north of here.~|~translationMissing
Hey, you can't go in there. Only employees of the grocery store can go in.~|~translationMissing
Well, can I get a job here?~|~translationMissing
Same as above from "Can I get a job here?"~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I didn't realise.~|~translationMissing
Can you put your white apron on before going in there, please?~|~translationMissing
You take an apron. It feels freshly starched and smells of laundry.~|~translationMissing
There are a lot of bananas in the crate.~|~translationMissing
You find your bottle of rum in amongst the bananas.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've got some.~|~translationMissing
(Frank takes the bottle from your inventory, but returns it shortly.)~|~translationMissing
Arr - this here rum's got a banana stuck in it!~|~translationMissing
Arr - I don't likes banana in me rum!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the rum~|~translationMissing
Now a deal's a deal, I'll tell ye about the treasure. I used to serve under a pirate captain called One-Eyed Hector.~|~translationMissing
Hector were very successful and became very rich. But about a year ago we were boarded by the Customs and Excise Agents.~|~translationMissing
Hector were killed along with many of the crew, I were one of the few to escape and I escaped with this.~|~translationMissing
Frank happily takes the rum... and hands you a key.~|~translationMissing
This be Hector's key. I believe it opens his chest in his old room in the Blue Moon Inn in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
With any luck his treasure will be in there.~|~translationMissing
Ok thanks, I'll go and get it.~|~translationMissing
So why didn't you ever get it?~|~translationMissing
I'm not allowed in the Blue Moon Inn. Apparently I'm a drunken trouble maker.~|~translationMissing
Frank, I have some Karamja Rum.~|~translationMissing
I seem to have lost my chest key...~|~translationMissing
Arr, silly you. Fortunately I took the precaution to have another one made.~|~translationMissing
Frank hands you a chest key.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Chest key.)~|~translationMissing
The chest is locked.~|~translationMissing
You unlock the chest.~|~translationMissing
All that's in the chest is a message...~|~translationMissing
You take the message from the chest.~|~translationMissing
Gardener~|~translationMissing
First moles, now this! Take this, vandal!~|~translationMissing
I can't dig up anything with him attacking me!~|~translationMissing
You dig a hole in the ground...~|~translationMissing
and find a little chest of treasure.~|~translationMissing
I have the treasure, would you like a share?~|~translationMissing
No [lad/lass], you got it fair and square.~|~translationMissing
You enjoy it. It's what Hector would have wanted.~|~translationMissing
You open the casket, and find One-Eyed Hector's treasure.~|~translationMissing

5.4.1 Talking to Edmond again before using the Ardougne teleport scroll~|~translationMissing
Hello old man.~|~translationMissing
Edmond~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I can't stop to talk...~|~translationMissing
I've got to find my daughter. I pray that she is still alive...~|~translationMissing
What's happened to her?~|~translationMissing
Elena's a healer. Three weeks ago she managed to cross the wall into West Ardougne. No one's allowed to cross the wall in case they spread the plague.~|~translationMissing
Plague?~|~translationMissing
Not that long ago, West Ardougne was hit by a deadly plague. They had the wall built to try and keep it contained. No one is allowed to enter the city now apart from the mourners.~|~translationMissing
They say the plague is a horrible way to go... That's why Elena felt she had to go help. She said she'd be gone for a few days but we've heard nothing since.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could help find her?~|~translationMissing
Really, would you? I've been working on a plan to get into West Ardougne, but I'm too old and tired to carry it through. But you on the other hand, you should have no problem.~|~translationMissing
Start the Plague City quest?~|~translationMissing
Where should I start?~|~translationMissing
If you're going into West Ardougne you'll need protection from the plague. My wife made a special gas mask for Elena with dwellberries rubbed into it.~|~translationMissing
They help to repel the plague apparently. We need some more though...~|~translationMissing
Where can I find these dwellberries?~|~translationMissing
The only place I know of is McGrubor's Wood, just west of Seers' Village. The berries are bright blue so they're easy to spot.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll go and get some.~|~translationMissing
The foresters keep a close eye on it, but there is a back way in.~|~translationMissing
On second thoughts, I'd better not.~|~translationMissing
Well if you hear anything about Elena please tell me.~|~translationMissing
I will. Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
Well, good luck finding her.~|~translationMissing
Hello Edmond.~|~translationMissing
Have you got the dwellberries yet?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'm afraid not.~|~translationMissing
You'll probably find them in McGrubor's Wood, just west of Seers' Village. The berries are bright blue so they're easy to spot.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Edmond has asked me to help find your daughter.~|~translationMissing
Alrena~|~translationMissing
Yes he told me. I've begun making your special gas mask, but I need some dwellberries to finish it.~|~translationMissing
I'll try to get some.~|~translationMissing
The best place to look is in McGrubor's Wood, just west of Seers' Village.~|~translationMissing
Yes I've got some here.~|~translationMissing
Take them to my wife Alrena, she's inside.~|~translationMissing
You give the dwellberries to Alrena.~|~translationMissing
Alrena crushes the berries into a smooth paste. She then smears the paste over a strange mask.~|~translationMissing
There we go, all done. While in West Ardougne you must wear this at all times, or you could catch the plague.~|~translationMissing
Alrena has given you a gas mask.~|~translationMissing
I'll make a spare mask for you in case you lose that one. I'll hide it in the cupboard in case the mourners come looking.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the gas mask~|~translationMissing
You search the cupboard but you find nothing.~|~translationMissing
You find a protective mask but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the gas mask~|~translationMissing
You find a protective mask.~|~translationMissing
Hello darling, I think Edmond had a good idea of how to get into West Ardougne, you should hear his idea.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll go and see him now.~|~translationMissing
Hi Edmond, I've got the gas mask now.~|~translationMissing
Good stuff, now for the digging. Beneath us are the Ardougne sewers. I've done some research, and I reckon you can use them to access to West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
I've already tried digging down to them but the soil is rock hard. You'll need to pour on several buckets of water to soften it up. I reckon four buckets should do it.~|~translationMissing
How's it going?~|~translationMissing
I still need to pour four more buckets of water on the soil.~|~translationMissing
Hello Alrena.~|~translationMissing
Hello darling, how's that tunnel coming along?~|~translationMissing
I just need to soften the soil and then we'll start digging.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm sure you're quicker than Edmond.~|~translationMissing
If Edmond has not told the player to pour water~|~translationMissing
You see no reason to do that at the moment.~|~translationMissing
If this is the first, second, or third bucket of water~|~translationMissing
You pour water onto the soil. The soil softens slightly.~|~translationMissing
If this is the fourth bucket of water~|~translationMissing
You pour water onto the soil. The soil is now soft enough to dig into.~|~translationMissing
You dig deep into the soft soil... Suddenly it crumbles away! You fall through into the sewer. Edmond follows you down the hole.~|~translationMissing
You climb up the mud pile.~|~translationMissing
You climb down into the hole.~|~translationMissing
I don't trust you.~|~translationMissing
You don't have to.~|~translationMissing
If I find you attempting to cross the wall I'll make sure you never return.~|~translationMissing
I still need to pour three more buckets of water on the soil.~|~translationMissing
I just need to soften the soil a little more and then we'll start digging.~|~translationMissing
I still need to pour two more buckets of water on the soil.~|~translationMissing
I still need to pour one more bucket of water on the soil.~|~translationMissing
I've soaked the soil with water.~|~translationMissing
That's great, it should be soft enough to dig through now. There should be a spade nearby that you can use.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Alrena.~|~translationMissing
How's the tunnel going?~|~translationMissing
One of the mourners has been sniffing around asking questions about you and Edmond, you should keep an eye out for him.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a gas mask~|~translationMissing
Also, don't forget about that spare gas mask if you need it. It's hidden in the cupboard.~|~translationMissing
Great, thanks Alrena!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a gas mask~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks for the warning.~|~translationMissing
What are you up to with old man Edmond?~|~translationMissing
Nothing, we've just been chatting.~|~translationMissing
What about his daughter?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you know about that then?~|~translationMissing
We know about everything that goes on in Ardougne. We have to if we are to contain the plague.~|~translationMissing
Have you see his daughter recently?~|~translationMissing
I imagine she's caught the plague. Either way she won't be allowed out of West Ardougne, the risk is too great.~|~translationMissing
I think it's the pipe to the south that comes up in West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
Alright I'll check it out.~|~translationMissing
Hi, have you managed to get through to West Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but I should be going soon.~|~translationMissing
Make sure you wear your mask while you're over there! I can't think of a worse way to die.~|~translationMissing
Don't forget, I've got a spare one hidden in the cupboard if you need it.~|~translationMissing
Been digging have we?~|~translationMissing
Your hands are covered in mud.~|~translationMissing
Oh that...~|~translationMissing
Funny, you don't look like the gardening type.~|~translationMissing
Oh no, I love gardening! It's my favorite pastime.~|~translationMissing
You and that Edmond fella, you're looking very suspicious.~|~translationMissing
We're just gardening. Have you heard any news about West Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
Just the usual, everyone's sick or dying. I'm furious at King Tyras for bringing this plague to our lands.~|~translationMissing
If the grill has not been removed~|~translationMissing
There is a grill blocking your way.~|~translationMissing
I can't let you enter the city without your gas mask on.~|~translationMissing
You climb up through the sewer pipe.~|~translationMissing
The grill is too secure. You can't pull it off alone.~|~translationMissing
You tie the end of the rope to the sewer pipe's grill.~|~translationMissing
Edmond, I can't get through to West Ardougne! There's an iron grill blocking my way, I can't pull it off alone.~|~translationMissing
If you get some rope you could tie to the grill, then we could both pull it at the same time.~|~translationMissing
I've tied a rope to the grill over there, will you help me pull it off?~|~translationMissing
Alright, let's get to it...~|~translationMissing
The player and Edmond pull on the rope, opening the grill on the pipe.~|~translationMissing
1... 2... 3... Pull!~|~translationMissing
Once you're in the city look for a man called Jethick. He's an old friend of the family. Hopefully he can help you.~|~translationMissing
Alright, thanks I will.~|~translationMissing
Have you found Elena yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, it's a big city over there.~|~translationMissing
I hope it's not too late.~|~translationMissing
Hello, any word on Elena?~|~translationMissing
Not yet I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else I can do to help?~|~translationMissing
It's alright, I'll get her back soon.~|~translationMissing
That's the spirit, dear. Don't forget that there's a spare gas mask in the cupboard if you need one.~|~translationMissing
That's the spirit, dear.~|~translationMissing
You climb down through the manhole.~|~translationMissing
You pull back the manhole cover.~|~translationMissing
You close the manhole cover.~|~translationMissing
You pull on the large wooden doors...~|~translationMissing
...But they will not open.~|~translationMissing
Hello, how's it going?~|~translationMissing
Woman~|~translationMissing
Bah, those mourners... they're meant to be helping us, but I think they're doing more harm here than good. They won't even let me send a letter out to my family.~|~translationMissing
Have you seen a lady called Elena around here?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've seen her. Very helpful person.~|~translationMissing
Not for the last few days though... I thought maybe she'd gone home.~|~translationMissing
You should stand up to them more.~|~translationMissing
Oh I'm not one to cause a fuss.~|~translationMissing
Life is tough.~|~translationMissing
Yes, living in a plague city must be hard.~|~translationMissing
Plague? Pah, that's no excuse for the treatment we've received. It's obvious pretty quickly if someone has the plague.~|~translationMissing
I'm thinking about making a break for it. I'm perfectly healthy, not gonna infect anyone.~|~translationMissing
Well, ain't much either you or me can do about it.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a lady called Elena.~|~translationMissing
I've not heard of her. Old Jethick knows a lot of people, maybe he'll know where you can find her.~|~translationMissing
We don't have good days here anymore. Curse King Tyras.~|~translationMissing
Oh okay, bad day then.~|~translationMissing
Why, what has he done?~|~translationMissing
His army curses our city with this plague then wanders off again, leaving us to clear up the pieces.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a woman called Elena.~|~translationMissing
Not heard of her.~|~translationMissing
An outsider! Can you get me out of this hell hole?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, that's not what I'm here to do.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, how did you get over here? You're not one of this rabble. Ah well, you'll have to stay. Can't risk you going back now.~|~translationMissing
So what's a mourner?~|~translationMissing
We're working for King Lathas of East Ardougne. He has tasked us with containing the accursed plague sweeping West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
We also do our best to ease these people's suffering. We're nicknamed mourners because we spend a lot of time at plague victim funerals, no one else is allowed to risk attending.~|~translationMissing
It's a demanding job, and we get little thanks from the people here.~|~translationMissing
I haven't got the plague though...~|~translationMissing
Can't risk you being a carrier. That protective clothing you have isn't regulation issue. It won't meet safety standards.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a woman named Elena.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I've heard of her. A healer I believe. She must be mad coming over here voluntarily.~|~translationMissing
I hear rumours she has probably caught the plague now. Very tragic, a stupid waste of life.~|~translationMissing
Ted Rehnison~|~translationMissing
Go away. We don't want any.~|~translationMissing
Jethick~|~translationMissing
Hello, I don't recognise you. We don't get many newcomers around here.~|~translationMissing
The plague of course. Not many people want to come to a place like this and the few that do normally get stopped by the mourners.~|~translationMissing
All you'll find here now are the dead and the dying. Even our own king has abandoned us.~|~translationMissing
Your king?~|~translationMissing
Yes, King Tyras of West Ardougne. He's the brother of King Lathas, the ruler of East Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
So where is the king?~|~translationMissing
Well he's always been a bit of an explorer. He's led multiple expeditions into the uncharted lands to the west.~|~translationMissing
The plague first started when he came back from one of these expeditions. More than a few suspect that some of his men caught it out there and brought it back with them.~|~translationMissing
The king didn't care though. He just left on another expedition to the west. He hasn't been seen since. He left the city warder Bravek in charge but he's no better.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you clearly didn't come here to talk about kings. So tell me, what brings you to West Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a woman from East Ardougne called Elena.~|~translationMissing
East Ardougnian women are easier to find in East Ardougne. Not many would come to West Ardougne to find one. Although the name is familiar, what does she look like?~|~translationMissing
Um... brown hair... in her twenties...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, that doesn't narrow it down a huge amount... I'll need to know more than that, or see a picture?~|~translationMissing
Clerk~|~translationMissing
Hello, welcome to the Civic Office of West Ardougne. How can I help you?~|~translationMissing
Who is through that door?~|~translationMissing
The city warder Bravek is in there.~|~translationMissing
Can I go in?~|~translationMissing
He has asked not to be disturbed.~|~translationMissing
I'm just looking thanks.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't have time to talk. Bravek needs lots of help running the city.~|~translationMissing
Not yet, it's a big city over there. Do you have a picture of Elena?~|~translationMissing
There should be a picture of Elena in the house. Please find her quickly, I hope it's not too late.~|~translationMissing
Do you have a picture of Elena?~|~translationMissing
Yes. There should be one in the house somewhere. Let me know if you need anything else.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not talked to Jethick before~|~translationMissing
If the player has talked to Jethick before~|~translationMissing
Hello. We don't get many newcomers around here.~|~translationMissing
You show Jethick the picture.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. She came over here to help the plague victims. I think she is staying over with the Rehnison family.~|~translationMissing
They live in the small timbered building at the far north side of town. I've not seen her around here in a while, mind.~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you could run me a little errand while you're over there? I borrowed this book from them, can you return it?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll return it for you.~|~translationMissing
Jethick shows you the book, but you don't have room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Jethick gives you a book.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have time for that.~|~translationMissing
I'm a friend of Jethick's, I have come to return a book he borrowed.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Why didn't you say, come in then.~|~translationMissing
You hand the book to Ted as you enter.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I've been missing that.~|~translationMissing
Billy isn't interested in talking.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I hear a woman called Elena is staying here.~|~translationMissing
Martha Rehnison~|~translationMissing
Yes she was staying here, but slightly over a week ago she was getting ready to go back. However she never managed to leave.~|~translationMissing
My daughter Milli was playing near the west wall when she saw some shadowy figures jump out and grab her. Milli is upstairs if you wish to speak to her.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Your parents say you saw what happened to Elena...~|~translationMissing
Milli Rehnison~|~translationMissing
*sniff* Yes I was near the south east corner when I saw Elena walking by. I was about to run to greet her when some men jumped out. They shoved a sack over her head and dragged her into a building.~|~translationMissing
Which building?~|~translationMissing
It was the boarded up building with no windows in the south east corner of West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
Any luck finding Elena yet?~|~translationMissing
I wish you luck, she did a lot for us.~|~translationMissing
The door won't open. You notice a black cross on the door.~|~translationMissing
I'd stand away from there. That black cross means that house has been touched by the plague.~|~translationMissing
But I think a kidnap victim is in here.~|~translationMissing
Sounds unlikely, even kidnappers wouldn't go in there. Even if someone is in there, they're probably dead by now.~|~translationMissing
Good Point.~|~translationMissing
I want to check anyway.~|~translationMissing
You don't have clearance to go in there.~|~translationMissing
How do I get clearance?~|~translationMissing
Well you'd need to apply to the head mourner, or I suppose Bravek the city warder.~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't get your hopes up though.~|~translationMissing
I fear not a mere plague.~|~translationMissing
That's irrelevant. You don't have clearance to go in there.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the warning.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm still looking.~|~translationMissing
I hope you find her. She was nice.~|~translationMissing
Head Mourner~|~translationMissing
How did you get into West Ardougne? Ah well you'll have to stay, can't risk you spreading the plague outside.~|~translationMissing
I need clearance to enter a plague house.~|~translationMissing
I need clearance to enter a plague house. It's in the south east corner of West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
You must be nuts, absolutely not!~|~translationMissing
There's a kidnap victim inside!~|~translationMissing
Well they're as good as dead then, no point in trying to save them.~|~translationMissing
I've got a gas mask though...~|~translationMissing
It's not regulation. Anyway you're not properly trained to deal with the plague.~|~translationMissing
How do I get trained?~|~translationMissing
It requires a strict 18 months of training.~|~translationMissing
I don't have that sort of time.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm utterly crazy.~|~translationMissing
You're wasting my time, I have a lot of work to do!~|~translationMissing
Bravek~|~translationMissing
Go away, I'm busy! I'm... Umm... In a meeting!~|~translationMissing
I need permission to enter a plague house.~|~translationMissing
Rather you than me! The mourners normally deal with that stuff, you should speak to them. Their headquarters are right near the city gate.~|~translationMissing
I'll try asking them then.~|~translationMissing
Surely you don't let them run everything for you?~|~translationMissing
Well, they do know what they're doing here. If they did start doing something badly Bravek, the city warder, would have the power to override them. I can't see that happening though.~|~translationMissing
Can I speak to Bravek anyway?~|~translationMissing
This is urgent though! Someone's been kidnapped!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll leave him alone.~|~translationMissing
Do you know when he will be available?~|~translationMissing
I'll see what I can do I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Mr Bravek, there's a man here who really needs to speak to you.~|~translationMissing
I suppose they can come in then. If they keep it short.~|~translationMissing
Oh I don't know, an hour or so maybe.~|~translationMissing
Bravek will see you now but keep it short!~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I won't take much of his time.~|~translationMissing
My head hurts! I'll speak to you another day...~|~translationMissing
This is really important though!~|~translationMissing
I can't possibly speak to you with my head spinning like this... I went a bit heavy on the drink again last night. Curse my herbalist, she made the best hang over cures. Darn inconvenient of her catching the plague.~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't drink so much then!~|~translationMissing
Well positions of responsibility are hard, I need something to take my mind off things... Especially with the problems this place has.~|~translationMissing
Do you know what's in the cure?~|~translationMissing
I don't think drink is the solution.~|~translationMissing
I don't feel well enough to have a philosophical discussion about it right now. My head hurts.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm let me think... Ouch! Thinking isn't clever. Ah here, she did scribble it down for me.~|~translationMissing
Bravek waves a tatty piece of paper at you, but you don't have room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Bravek hands you a tatty piece of paper.~|~translationMissing
Uurgh! My head still hurts too much to think straight. Oh for one of Trudi's hangover cures!~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the scruffy note~|~translationMissing
You mix the chocolate into the bucket.~|~translationMissing
You mix the snape grass into the bucket.~|~translationMissing
Try this.~|~translationMissing
You give Bravek the hangover cure. Bravek gulps down the foul-looking liquid.~|~translationMissing
Ooh that's much better! Thanks, that's the clearest my head has felt in a month. Ah now, what was it you wanted me to do for you?~|~translationMissing
I need to rescue a kidnap victim called Elena. She's being held in a plague house, I need permission to enter.~|~translationMissing
Well the mourners deal with that sort of thing...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll go speak to them.~|~translationMissing
Is that all anyone says around here?~|~translationMissing
Well, they know best about plague issues.~|~translationMissing
Don't you want to take an interest in it at all?~|~translationMissing
Nope, I don't wish to take a deep interest in plagues. That stuff is too scary for me!~|~translationMissing
I see why people say you're a weak leader.~|~translationMissing
Bah, people always criticise their leaders but delegating is the only way to lead. I delegate all plague issues to the mourners.~|~translationMissing
This whole city is a plague issue!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll talk to the mourners.~|~translationMissing
They won't listen to me!~|~translationMissing
They say I'm not properly equipped to go in the house, though I do have a very effective gas mask.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well I guess they're not taking the issue of a kidnapping seriously enough. They do go a bit far sometimes.~|~translationMissing
I've heard of Elena, she has helped us a lot... Okay, I'll give you this warrant to enter the house.~|~translationMissing
Bravek waves a warrant at you, but you don't have room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Bravek hands you a warrant.~|~translationMissing
Thanks again for the hangover cure.~|~translationMissing
Ah now what was it you wanted me to do for you?~|~translationMissing
I need to rescue Elena. She's now a kidnap victim! She's being held in a plague house, I need permission to enter.~|~translationMissing
Not a problem, happy to help out.~|~translationMissing
I'm just having a little drop of whisky, then I'll feel really good.~|~translationMissing
I have a warrant from Bravek to enter here.~|~translationMissing
This is highly irregular. Please wait...~|~translationMissing
Hey... I've got someone here with a warrant from Bravek, what should we do?~|~translationMissing
Mourner (2)~|~translationMissing
Well you can't let them in...~|~translationMissing
You wait until the mourner's back is turned and sneak into the building.~|~translationMissing
Hey get me out of here please!~|~translationMissing
I would do but I don't have a key.~|~translationMissing
I think there may be one around somewhere. I'm sure I heard them stashing it somewhere.~|~translationMissing
Have you caught the plague?~|~translationMissing
No, I have none of the symptoms.~|~translationMissing
Strange, I was told this house was plague infected.~|~translationMissing
I suppose that was a cover up by the kidnappers.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll look for it.~|~translationMissing
You find a small key in the barrel.~|~translationMissing
Hi, you're free to go! Your kidnappers don't seem to be about right now.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, being kidnapped was so inconvenient. I was on my way back to East Ardougne with some samples, I want to see if I can diagnose a cure for this plague.~|~translationMissing
Well you can leave via the manhole in the middle of the city.~|~translationMissing
Go and see my father, I'll make sure he adequately rewards you. Now I'd better leave while I still can.~|~translationMissing
Yes, she is safe at home now.~|~translationMissing
That's good to hear, she helped us a lot.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for rescuing my daughter! Elena has told me of your bravery in entering a house that could have been plague infected. I can't thank you enough!~|~translationMissing
Thank you, thank you! Elena beat you back by minutes. Now I said I'd give you a reward. What can I give you as a reward I wonder? Here take this magic scroll, I have little use for it but it may help you.~|~translationMissing
Now I'd recommend you go and see Elena. She'll want to thank you herself. She lives in the house opposite ours.~|~translationMissing
Ah hello. Thank you again for rescuing my daughter.~|~translationMissing

14 Giving Drezel the last of the essence~|~translationMissing
You knock at the door...~|~translationMissing
Doesn't seem like anyone's home.~|~translationMissing
Well hello there. What do you want with the king of Misthalin?~|~translationMissing
A quest you say? Hmm, what an odd request to make of the king. It's funny you should mention it though, as there is something you can do for me.~|~translationMissing
Are you aware of Paterdomus? It's a temple east of here. It stands on the River Salve and guards the only passage into the deadly lands of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't think I know it...~|~translationMissing
Hmm, how strange that you don't. Well anyway, it has been some days since last I heard from Drezel, the priest who lives there.~|~translationMissing
Be a sport and go make sure that nothing untoward has happened to the silly old codger for me, would you?~|~translationMissing
Start the Priest in Peril quest?~|~translationMissing
Sure. I don't have anything better to do right now.~|~translationMissing
Many thanks adventurer! I would have sent one of my squires but they wanted payment for it!~|~translationMissing
Why do you care about Drezel anyway?~|~translationMissing
Well, that is a slightly impertinent question to ask of your king, but I shall overlook it this time.~|~translationMissing
As you are no doubt aware, this kingdom worships Saradomin, the god of wisdom and order. As such, it is a peaceful place to live and prosper.~|~translationMissing
Paterdomus, the temple where Drezel lives, stands on the eastern border of Misthalin. It guards the only passage into the evil lands of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Evil?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. Morytania is a fearful place, filled to the brim with accursed servants of the chaos god Zamorak. All of them are terrible, but none more so than the rulers of the region, the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
Thankfully, the sacred River Salve marks a natural border between Misthalin and Morytania. Together, the river and the temple prevent any invasion by the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
The waters of the river are kept blessed with Saradomin's almighty power. This ensures our defences remain strong, as the vampyres cannot cross such a holy barrier.~|~translationMissing
Drezel is descended from one of the original Saradominist priests who first blessed the river. His job is to ensure nothing happens to the river that might allow the evil of Morytania to invade this land.~|~translationMissing
This is the reason why the lack of communication from him bothers me somewhat, although I am sure nobody would dare to try and attack our kingdom!~|~translationMissing
Do I get a reward for this?~|~translationMissing
You will be rewarded in the knowledge that you have done the right thing and assisted the king of Misthalin.~|~translationMissing
Soooooo...... that would be a 'no' then?~|~translationMissing
That is correct.~|~translationMissing
Who's Drezel?~|~translationMissing
Drezel is the priest who lives at Paterdomus, the temple to the east. You're supposed to be making sure that nothing bad has happened to him. Remember?~|~translationMissing
Ooooooooh, THAT Drezel. Yup, I remember.~|~translationMissing
No. That sounds boring.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I dare say it does. I wouldn't even have mentioned it had you not seemed to be looking for something to do anyway.~|~translationMissing
You have news of Drezel for me?~|~translationMissing
Where am I supposed to go again?~|~translationMissing
The temple of Paterdomus where Drezel lives. It is but a short journey east from here. It lies south of the cliffs, at the source of the River Salve.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, you can't miss it.~|~translationMissing
You knock at the door...You hear a voice from inside.~|~translationMissing
Who are you and what do you want?~|~translationMissing
Ummmm.....~|~translationMissing
Roald sent me to check on Drezel.~|~translationMissing
Psst... Hey... Who's Roald? Who's Drezel?~|~translationMissing
Uh... Isn't Drezel that dude upstairs? Oh, wait, Roald's the king of Misthalin right?~|~translationMissing
He is? Aww man...~|~translationMissing
Hey, you deal with this okay.~|~translationMissing
He's just coming! Wait a second!~|~translationMissing
Hello, my name is Drevil.~|~translationMissing
Drezel!~|~translationMissing
I mean Drezel. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
Well, as I say, the king sent me to make sure everything's okay with you.~|~translationMissing
And, uh, what would you do if everything wasn't okay with me?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. Ask you what help you need I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Ah, good, well, I don't think...~|~translationMissing
Psst... Hey... The dog!~|~translationMissing
OH! Yes, of course!~|~translationMissing
Will you do me a favour, adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Sure. I'm a helpful person!~|~translationMissing
HAHAHAHA! Really? Thanks buddy! You see that mausoleum out there? There's a horrible big dog underneath it that I'd like you to kill for me! It's been really bugging me! Barking all the time and stuff!~|~translationMissing
Please kill it for me buddy!~|~translationMissing
Okey-dokey, one dead dog coming up.~|~translationMissing
Nope. Something about all this is very suspicious...~|~translationMissing
Get lost then! I have important things to do, as sure as my name is Dibzil.~|~translationMissing
Drezel. Now, go away!~|~translationMissing
Hi, I just moved in next door.~|~translationMissing
Can I borrow a cup of coffee?~|~translationMissing
What next door? What's coffee? Who ARE you?~|~translationMissing
I hear this place is of historic interest.~|~translationMissing
Can I come in and have a wander around? Possibly look at some antiques or buy something from your gift shop?~|~translationMissing
Pssst... Hey... Is this place of historic interest?~|~translationMissing
I dunno. I guess it might be. Does it matter?~|~translationMissing
I suppose not.~|~translationMissing
Clear off! You can't come in!~|~translationMissing
The council sent me to check your pipes.~|~translationMissing
They did? Ummm....~|~translationMissing
Psst... Are there any pipes in here, you reckon?~|~translationMissing
I dunno... I don't think so...~|~translationMissing
We don't have any thanks! Bye!~|~translationMissing
Nothing. Never mind.~|~translationMissing
SHHHH! It's the adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Ah! I want you to go kill the horrible dog in the mausoleum for me! You can use the entrance out there.~|~translationMissing
You'll do this for good old Delzig, won't ya buddy?~|~translationMissing
*cough* for good old Drezel, right buddy?~|~translationMissing
Excuse me...oh, wait, I thought you were someone else.~|~translationMissing
No problem. Have a good day!~|~translationMissing
And yourself.~|~translationMissing
The gate is securely locked.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... From the looks of things, it seems as though somebody has been trying to force this gate open. It's still securely locked however.~|~translationMissing
Well... I went to the temple like you asked me to... and I spoke to someone inside...~|~translationMissing
Ah, well that must have been Drezel then. What did he say?~|~translationMissing
Well... he seemed to be having some kind of trouble. He asked for my help.~|~translationMissing
Well I expect you to offer him your full assistance in whatever he needs.~|~translationMissing
Well... okay then.~|~translationMissing
There we go, one dead dog. I should go and tell Drezel.~|~translationMissing
You again? What do you want now?~|~translationMissing
I killed that dog for you.~|~translationMissing
Really? Hey, that's great!~|~translationMissing
Yeah thanks a lot buddy!~|~translationMissing
HAHAHAHAHAHA!~|~translationMissing
What's so funny?~|~translationMissing
Nothing buddy! We're just so grateful!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, maybe you should go tell the king what a great job you did buddy!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I spoke to the guys at the temple. They said they were being bothered by a dog in the mausoleum, so I went and killed it for them. No problem.~|~translationMissing
YOU DID WHAT???~|~translationMissing
Are you a complete imbecile?~|~translationMissing
That mausoleum contain the only passage between Morytania and Misthalin! Not only that, it's built right over the source of the River Salve!~|~translationMissing
Did I make a mistake?~|~translationMissing
YES YOU DID!!!!! Without that 'dog', there's nothing to stop someone from entering the mausoleum to sabotage the blessings on the river. Thanks to you, all of Misthalin is now at risk!~|~translationMissing
B-but... Drezel told me to...~|~translationMissing
No, you absolute cretin! Obviously some fiend has done something to Drezel and tricked your feeble intellect into helping them kill that guard dog!~|~translationMissing
Now you get back there and do whatever is necessary to safeguard the kingdom from attack, or I will see you beheaded for high treason!~|~translationMissing
Y-yes your highness.~|~translationMissing
YOU! Why haven't you ensured the border with Morytania is secure yet?~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay... I'm going, I'm going... There's no need to shout...~|~translationMissing
NO NEED TO SHOUT???~|~translationMissing
Listen, and listen well, and see if your puny mind can comprehend this~|~translationMissing
if the border is not protected, then we are all at the mercy of the vampyres!~|~translationMissing
I would say that me shouting at you for your incompetence is the LEAST of your worries right now. NOW GO!~|~translationMissing
It sounds like there's something alive inside it. I don't think it would be a very good idea to open it...~|~translationMissing
Oh! You do not appear to be one of those Zamorakians who imprisoned me! Who are you and why are you here?~|~translationMissing
My name's [player name]. King Roald sent me to find out what was going on at the temple. I take it you are Drezel?~|~translationMissing
That's right! Oh, praise be to Saradomin! All is not yet lost!~|~translationMissing
I feared that when those Zamorakians attacked this place and imprisoned me up here, Misthalin would be doomed!~|~translationMissing
If they should manage to desecrate the holy River Salve, we will be defenceless against the vampyres of Morytania!~|~translationMissing
Why is the river such a good defence?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure if this is the best time for a history lesson. I suppose I can give you a brief overview though. It might help you understand our next steps.~|~translationMissing
It is said that many years ago, the land that is now Morytania was a peaceful Saradominist kingdom. Alas, all that ended when the vampyres invaded, claiming the land as their own.~|~translationMissing
Morytania wasn't enough for them though. Soon, they set their sights on these lands as well.~|~translationMissing
Misthalin would have quickly fallen to the vampyres, were it not for the bravery of the Seven Priestly Warriors.~|~translationMissing
They led the armies of Misthalin against the vampyres in a great battle that took place right where this temple stands.~|~translationMissing
For ten days and nights they fought, never sleeping, never eating, fuelled by their desire to make the world a better place for humans to live.~|~translationMissing
On the eleventh day they were to be joined by reinforcements. However, when those reinforcements arrived, they found the Seven Priestly Warriors and their forces had been slain by the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
Their sacrifice was not in vain though. Before they were defeated, the Seven Priestly Warriors managed to bless the Salve with the holy power of Saradomin.~|~translationMissing
Their blessings remain to this day, ensuring no vampyre can cross the river.~|~translationMissing
The temple here was built soon after. It guards the source of the River Salve, and acts as the only passage between Misthalin and Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Once the temple was complete, the bodies of the Seven Priestly Warriors were laid to rest in tombs of honour in the mausoleum below. On the top of each tomb, a golden gift was placed as a mark of respect.~|~translationMissing
A great statue was also built over the river, so that all who might try and cross into Misthalin would know that these lands are protected by Saradomin himself.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I can see how the river protects the border. Where do these Zamorakians fit in though?~|~translationMissing
Well, as much as it saddens me to say so adventurer, Lord Saradomin's presence has not been felt on the land for many years now.~|~translationMissing
Of course, while we know that he still watches over us, his power here is not as strong as it once was.~|~translationMissing
I fear this group of Zamorakians intends to take advantage of that. If they can somehow pollute the Salve, the blessings on the river might fail.~|~translationMissing
If that happens, there won't be anything to stop an invasion from Morytania.~|~translationMissing
So what do you say adventurer? Will you aid me and all of Misthalin in foiling this Zamorakian plot?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, adventurer. There is a well in the mausoleum beneath the temple that provides direct access to the source of the Salve. That will be where the Zamorakians will attempt their sabotage.~|~translationMissing
We need to get to that well. However, the immediate problem is that I'm trapped in this cell.~|~translationMissing
The key must be somewhere nearby. One of the Zamorakians might have it, or they might have hidden it somewhere. That's not the only problem though.~|~translationMissing
What else is there?~|~translationMissing
When the Salve was blessed, a small number of vampyres were left trapped on this side of it. They were heavily weakened, but still posed a dangerous threat.~|~translationMissing
This coffin here contains one of those vampyres. The Zamorakians somehow found it and brought it here with them.~|~translationMissing
I see. It doesn't seem to be posing a threat right now though.~|~translationMissing
No, but as those fiendish Zamorakians pointed out to me with delight, as I am the descendant of one of the Seven Priestly Warriors who blessed the river, it will likely recognise the smell of my blood.~|~translationMissing
If I get too close, it will probably wake up and kill me, very slowly and painfully.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could kill it somehow?~|~translationMissing
No adventurer, you should not risk waking it. Even now, it could pose a huge threat.~|~translationMissing
The priests of old would incapacitate trapped vampyres with the blessings of Saradomin. I suggest you do the same.~|~translationMissing
Right. So, I need to find the key to your cell and do something about the vampyre. Got it.~|~translationMissing
Oooooh... I knew it was too good to be true... Then leave me to my fate villain, there's no need to taunt me as well as keeping me imprisoned.~|~translationMissing
Well, let's just say if we cannot undo whatever damage has been done here, the entire land is in grave peril!~|~translationMissing
How goes it adventurer? Any luck in finding the key to the cell or a way of stopping the vampyre yet?~|~translationMissing
Well don't give up adventurer! That key must be around here somewhere! I know none of those Zamorakians ever got very far from this building!~|~translationMissing
I could hear them laughing about some gullible fool that they tricked into killing the guard dog at the monument.~|~translationMissing
Honestly, what kind of idiot would go around killing things just because a stranger told them to? What kind of oafish, numb-skulled, dim-witted...~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, I get the picture!~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about this temple?~|~translationMissing
Thank you for the information. I'll get going.~|~translationMissing
I do indeed, sire. He has been imprisoned by some Zamorakian monks.~|~translationMissing
What? This is wholly unacceptable! I order you to do all that you can to free Drezel immediately!~|~translationMissing
I was doing that anyway.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. In that case keep up the good work.~|~translationMissing
I have this key I took from one of those Zamorakian monks!~|~translationMissing
Excellent work adventurer! Quickly, try it on the door, and see if it will free me!~|~translationMissing
You swap the Golden key for the Iron key.~|~translationMissing
You use the key to unlock the cell door.~|~translationMissing
I have this key I took from one of the monuments underground.~|~translationMissing
Oh! Thank you! You have found the key!~|~translationMissing
The key fit the lock! You're free to leave now!~|~translationMissing
Excellent work, adventurer! Unfortunately, as you know, I cannot risk waking the vampyre in that coffin.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any ideas about dealing with the vampyre?~|~translationMissing
Well, the water of the Salve should still have enough power to work against the vampyre, even if the Zamorakians have desecrated it.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should try and get hold of some?~|~translationMissing
Have you freed Drezel yet?~|~translationMissing
Well, I found the key to his cell and unlocked it, but there's a vampyre in there stopping him leaving.~|~translationMissing
A vampyre? Well, I order you to do something about it at once!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I was planning on doing that anyway.~|~translationMissing
Good work! Always a place for quick thinkers in my kingdom!~|~translationMissing
You look down the well and see the filthy polluted water of the River Salve moving slowly along.~|~translationMissing
I don't think pouring normal water on the coffin is going to help...~|~translationMissing
This water doesn't look particularly holy to me... I think I'd better check with Drezel first.~|~translationMissing
I have some water from the Salve. It seems to have been desecrated though. Do you think you could bless it for me?~|~translationMissing
Yes, good thinking adventurer! Give it to me, I will bless it!~|~translationMissing
Drezel blesses the water for you.~|~translationMissing
You pour the blessed water over the coffin...~|~translationMissing
I have some blessed water from the Salve in this bucket. Do you think it will help against that vampyre?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Great idea! If his coffin is doused in the blessed water he will be unable to leave it! Use it on his coffin, quickly!~|~translationMissing
The vampyre should be dealt with. I'd still best not risk it though.~|~translationMissing
Yes sire.~|~translationMissing
Aha! Good work adventurer! What news of the border defences against Morytania?~|~translationMissing
I, uh, don't know about that...~|~translationMissing
Well get back and find out at once! This is a matter of national security and if I find out we are vulnerable I will hold you personally responsible!~|~translationMissing
I poured the blessed water over the coffin. I think that should trap the vampyre in there long enough for you to escape.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work adventurer! I am free at last! Let me ensure that evil vampyre is trapped for good. I will then meet you down in the mausoleum.~|~translationMissing
I just need to ensure this vampyre is trapped. I will meet you down in the mausoleum.~|~translationMissing
Have you ensured Misthalin's border is fully secured?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'm working on it though.~|~translationMissing
STOP!~|~translationMissing
Can't I go through there?~|~translationMissing
No, you cannot! It is taking all of my willpower to hold that barrier in place. You must restore the sanctity of the Salve as soon as possible!~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]. Glad you made it. Things are worse than I feared down here. I'm not sure if I will be able to repair the damage.~|~translationMissing
Why, what's happened?~|~translationMissing
Sadly, with the guard dog gone, there was nothing to stop those Zamorakians from entering the mausoleum. From what I can tell, they have used some kind of evil potion to pollute the Salve.~|~translationMissing
The well here is built right over the source of the river. That means that their potion will spread all the way down the Salve, disrupting the blessings placed upon it.~|~translationMissing
Before long, there will be nothing to stop the vampyres from invading Misthalin at their leisure.~|~translationMissing
What can we do to prevent that?~|~translationMissing
This passage is currently the only route between Morytania and Misthalin. The barrier here draws power from the river.~|~translationMissing
I have managed to reinforce the barrier, but I must continue focussing on it to keep it intact. Although the passage is safe for now, I do not know how long I can keep it that way.~|~translationMissing
This passage could be the least of our worries soon though. Before long, the vampyres will be able to cross at any point of the river. We won't be able to reinforce all of it.~|~translationMissing
Couldn't you bless the river to purify it? Like you did with the water I took from the well?~|~translationMissing
No, that would not work. The power I have from Saradomin is not great enough to cleanse an entire river of this foul Zamorakian pollutant.~|~translationMissing
However, I do have one other idea.~|~translationMissing
I believe we might be able to soak up the evil magic that the potion has released into the river.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you know of runestones, used by mages to power their spells. The essence used to create these stones absorbs magical potential from runic altars to be released later.~|~translationMissing
And you think we could use some rune essence to absorb the magic they've released into the Salve?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. If you could bring me fifty essence, I should be able to reverse the damage done. Be quick though. The longer we wait, the worse things will get.~|~translationMissing
Bring me fifty rune essence so that I can undo the damage done by those Zamorakians.~|~translationMissing
I brought you some rune essence.~|~translationMissing
Quickly, give them to me!~|~translationMissing
If the player has brought rune essence~|~translationMissing
You give Drezel some essence.~|~translationMissing
If the player has brought pure essence~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I need [1-50] more.~|~translationMissing
How much more essence do I need to bring you?~|~translationMissing
I need [1-50] more.~|~translationMissing
I brought you some more essence.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! That should do it! I will bless these stones and place them within the well. With the river safe, Misthalin should be protected from the vampyres once more!~|~translationMissing
Please take this dagger. It has been handed down within my family for generations and is filled with the power of Saradomin.~|~translationMissing
You will find that it has the ability to prevent werewolves from adopting their wolf form in combat. Hopefully it comes in useful.~|~translationMissing
So can I pass through that barrier now?~|~translationMissing
Into Morytania? Yes, you can. The barrier will prevent the servants of Zamorak from entering Misthalin, but it is safe for those blessed by Saradomin.~|~translationMissing
I must warn you though, Morytania is an evil land. The region is filled with creatures and monsters more terrifying than any you'll find on this side of the Salve.~|~translationMissing
Worst of all are the vampyres, the rulers of Morytania. Be very cautious of their kind. Many are completely immune to human weaponry. Those that aren't, are still very hard to kill.~|~translationMissing
I'll be careful. Anything else I should know?~|~translationMissing
The first settlement you'll likely come across is Canifis, a town of werewolves. They probably won't attack you unless provoked, but you should still be cautious.~|~translationMissing
You should keep your Wolfbane dagger to hand. It will prevent them from taking on their wolf form.~|~translationMissing
I see. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
One last thing. While in Morytania, stay alert for any mention of the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
The Myreque?~|~translationMissing
Yes. They're a band of freedom fighters. They fight to protect the humans trapped in Morytania from the tyranny of the vampyres. Their hope is to one day rid the region of all evil.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf, the leader of their Mort Myre group, is an old friend. I imagine they'd appreciate the help of someone like you, if you can find them.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep an eye out for them.~|~translationMissing
Right, I think that's everything. Just the blessing itself now. Hold still a moment.~|~translationMissing
Drezel blesses you, allowing you to pass through the barrier into Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Good luck out there. Stay safe.~|~translationMissing
Do you know of anything I can do in Morytania?~|~translationMissing

Can I help you? You must need some help here in the desert.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
Well... we do currently have a very urgent issue we need to resolve, and I suppose you look like someone who knows how to get a job done. Are you definitely interested in helping?~|~translationMissing
Start the Prince Ali Rescue quest?~|~translationMissing
You'll find our Spymaster, Osman, just outside the palace. Go to him and tell him I sent you. He will fill you in on the details of our problem.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll get to it.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I've changed my mind.~|~translationMissing
I see. Well you know where to find me if you do wish to help us.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) It's just too hot here. How can you stand it?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you mind if I just kill your warriors?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'd better be off.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Have you spoken to Osman yet? He should be just outside the palace.~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'll go and see him.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. I hear you have agreed to help rescue Prince Ali. On behalf of the Emir, I will have a reward ready for you upon your success.~|~translationMissing
Osman? I was told by the Chancellor to come and speak to you. Apparently you have an issue that I can help with.~|~translationMissing
That would be an apt description. However, I find you to be an interesting choice by the Chancellor. Why has he chosen to trust you with this task over one of our own?~|~translationMissing
Er... I just asked if he needed help and he said yes.~|~translationMissing
That man is far too trusting at a time when we must take extra care. However, if he has made his decision, I will not question it. Still, you should know that I will be keeping a close eye on you.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. So what is this issue?~|~translationMissing
Prince Ali, heir to the Emir of Al Kharid, has been taken. My spies have already discovered where he is being held, but we need someone to make the rescue.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm sure I can manage that. How do I go about rescuing him?~|~translationMissing
The Prince has been taken by a group of bandits led by the self-proclaimed 'Lady' Keli. They are holding him in the abandoned jail just east of Draynor Village.~|~translationMissing
According to our information, Keli is the only one able to freely move around the area. For you to get the Prince out, you will need to disguise him as her. She will of course need dealing with first.~|~translationMissing
Why can't I just go in and kill her and her bandits?~|~translationMissing
And endanger the life of the Prince in the process? No. There will be no unnecessary risks. We need to do this with as little bloodshed as possible.~|~translationMissing
You make a fair point. Do you know what Keli looks like?~|~translationMissing
She has blonde hair and wears pink clothes. My daughter, Leela, one of my spies, is currently in Draynor Village keeping an eye on the jail. I'm sure she can help you with the specifics.~|~translationMissing
Before you go, there is one more thing. You'll need a key to get the Prince out of his cell. Keli has the only one. You could steal it, but that seems like a risk we should avoid.~|~translationMissing
But if she has the only copy, and I can't just steal it, how do I get the key?~|~translationMissing
If you bring me an imprint of the key along with a bronze bar, I can have a copy made for you. You should be able to make an imprint of the key using some soft clay.~|~translationMissing
Of course, you'll need to find a way to get Keli to show you the key without causing suspicion. I'm sure Leela can help you with that.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like I should head on over to Draynor Village and see Leela then.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Do you have any further questions before you go?~|~translationMissing
Do you know why they've taken the Prince?~|~translationMissing
No, but we have our theories.~|~translationMissing
Care to share them?~|~translationMissing
No. You have not yet proven yourself enough to be trusted with that information.~|~translationMissing
Now, do you have any further questions?~|~translationMissing
Where abouts in Draynor is Leela?~|~translationMissing
She will be somewhere near the abandoned jail that the bandits are using. It's just east of the village.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any further questions?~|~translationMissing
No. I think I know everything I need to.~|~translationMissing
Then you should get going.~|~translationMissing
You again. How are things going in Draynor?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key imprint but no bronze bar~|~translationMissing
I have an imprint of the key.~|~translationMissing
Good. Bring me a bronze bar, and I'll get a copy made.~|~translationMissing
You give Osman the imprint along with a bronze bar.~|~translationMissing
I'll use this to have a copy of the key made. I'll send it to Leela once it's ready.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not acquired the key imprint~|~translationMissing
I'm still working on gathering all the items I need.~|~translationMissing
Well if you need help, just talk to Leela.~|~translationMissing
You must be Leela. Your father sent me to help rescue Prince Ali.~|~translationMissing
Leela~|~translationMissing
Yes, he sent word ahead that you'd be coming. Are you aware of the plan?~|~translationMissing
I need to obtain a copy of the key to the Prince's cell, create a disguise for him that makes him look like Keli and then break him out of the jail.~|~translationMissing
I'd say that's a good summary. Now, do you have any questions for me about any part of the plan?~|~translationMissing
Any ideas for the key?~|~translationMissing
Keli keeps it on her at all times, on a chain around her neck. If you can convince her to show it to you, you might be able to use some soft clay to take an imprint.~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't obtained the key print yet~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound easy.~|~translationMissing
My suggestion is that you pretend to be interested in joining her bandits. From there, you should be able to steer the conversation towards the key.~|~translationMissing
Once you have the imprint, take it to my father along with a bronze bar. He'll then be able to make us a copy.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the key print in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I already have the imprint!~|~translationMissing
Then you should take it to my father along with a bronze bar. He'll then be able to make us a copy.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any other questions about the plan?~|~translationMissing
Any ideas for the disguise?~|~translationMissing
To make the Prince look like Keli, you'll need a blonde wig and a pink skirt. You'll also want some skin paste to hide the black eye he got when they captured him.~|~translationMissing
There's an old sailor in the village who makes rope. Perhaps he could make you a wig. Don't forget to dye it once you have one.~|~translationMissing
For the skin paste, there's a local witch who's apparently an expert on all sorts of potions. I'm sure she could make you some. I hear she also sells dye, if you need some for the wig.~|~translationMissing
Finally there's the skirt. I imagine you could just buy one from any clothes shop. Thessalia's Fine Clothes in Varrock is probably the closest.~|~translationMissing
Don't think so. I'll go and prepare.~|~translationMissing
You're back. Do you have everything needed yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'll go and prepare.~|~translationMissing
Could you make other things apart from rope?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I can. What are you thinking of?~|~translationMissing
Could you knit me a sweater?~|~translationMissing
Do I look like a member of a sewing circle? Be off wi' you. I have fought monsters that would turn your hair blue.~|~translationMissing
I don't need to be laughed at just 'cos I'm getting a bit old.~|~translationMissing
How about some sort of wig?~|~translationMissing
Well... that's an interesting thought. Yes, I think I could do something. Give me three balls of wool and I might be able to do it.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have three balls of wool~|~translationMissing
Great, I will get some. I think a wig would be useful.~|~translationMissing
If the player has three balls of wool~|~translationMissing
I have them here. Please make me a wig.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll have a go.~|~translationMissing
Ned gives you a pretty good wig.~|~translationMissing
Here you go. How's that for a quick effort? Not bad I think!~|~translationMissing
Thanks Ned. There's more to you than meets the eye.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't need one right now.~|~translationMissing
Could you repair the arrow holes in the back of my shirt?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, it's a tough world these days. There's a few brave enough to attack from ten metres away.~|~translationMissing
Ned pulls out a needle and attacks your shirt.~|~translationMissing
There you go, good as new.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Ned. Maybe next time they will attack me face to face.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Actually, I don't need anything.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't need anything.~|~translationMissing
Can you make skin paste?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all the required items~|~translationMissing
Why, it's one of my most popular potions! Lots of people around here like to pretty their faces up a bit. I can make it for you if you get me what's needed.~|~translationMissing
Well dearie, you need a base for the paste. That's a mix of ash, flour and water. Then you need redberries to colour it as you want. Bring me those four items and I will make you some.~|~translationMissing
If the player has all the required items~|~translationMissing
Yes I can. I see you already have the ingredients. Would you like me to mix some for you now?~|~translationMissing
Yes please. Mix me some skin paste.~|~translationMissing
That should be simple. Hand the things to Aggie then.~|~translationMissing
You hand the ash, flour, water and redberries to Aggie. She tips the ingredients into a cauldron and mutters some words.~|~translationMissing
Tourniquet, Fenderbaum, Tottenham, Marshmallow, Marblearch.~|~translationMissing
Aggie hands you the skin paste.~|~translationMissing
There you go dearie. That will make you look good at the Varrock dances.~|~translationMissing
No thank you. I don't need any skin paste right now.~|~translationMissing
Okay dearie, that's always your choice.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you make dyes for me please?~|~translationMissing
Are you the famous Lady Keli? Leader of the toughest gang of bandits around?~|~translationMissing
Lady Keli~|~translationMissing
Yes, I am Keli. You've heard of me then?~|~translationMissing
Heard of you? You're famous in Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
That's very kind of you to say. Reputations are not easily earned. I have managed to succeed where many fail.~|~translationMissing
What's your latest plan then?~|~translationMissing
Why do you want to know?~|~translationMissing
Well I was actually hoping to join your group.~|~translationMissing
Join us? Interesting... I suppose you do look the type.~|~translationMissing
You'll of course need to properly prove yourself before we let you join us. However, what I can tell you is that we currently have a very valuable prisoner. If all goes well, he will make us very rich.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. You must have been very skillful.~|~translationMissing
To catch him? Oh yes. We had to grab him without his bodyguards noticing. It was a stroke of genius. Mostly my doing, of course.~|~translationMissing
How do you know someone won't try to free him?~|~translationMissing
Well good luck with it.~|~translationMissing
There is no way to release him. The only key to his cell is on a chain around my neck, and the locksmith who made it died very suddenly.~|~translationMissing
There isn't another key like this in the world.~|~translationMissing
Could I see the key please?~|~translationMissing
It will be something I can tell my grandchildren, when you are even more famous than you are now.~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose there's no harm in letting you see it. After all, you have no hope of stealing it.~|~translationMissing
Keli shows you a small key on a strong looking chain.~|~translationMissing
Could I touch the key for a moment please?~|~translationMissing
Well... only for a moment then.~|~translationMissing
As you touch the key, you take an imprint of it using your soft clay.~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much! You are too kind.~|~translationMissing
You are welcome, but run along now. I will need some time to consider your request to join us.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I'd better go now.~|~translationMissing
That is a good way to keep secrets.~|~translationMissing
It is the best way I know. Dead men tell no tales.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll be off. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
You must have trained a lot for this work.~|~translationMissing
I have used a sword since I was a girl. My first kill was before I was even six years old.~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't disturb someone as tough as you.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I am very busy. Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
I've heard rumours that you kill people.~|~translationMissing
There's always someone ready to spread rumours. I hear all sort of ridiculous things these days.~|~translationMissing
No, I've never really heard of you.~|~translationMissing
You must be new around here then. Everyone knows of Lady Keli and her prowess with a sword.~|~translationMissing
No, still doesn't ring a bell.~|~translationMissing
Well, you know of me now. You should also know that I will wring your neck if you don't show some respect.~|~translationMissing
I don't show respect to killers and hoodlums.~|~translationMissing
You should, you really should. I am wealthy enough to place a bounty on your head, or I could just remove your head myself. Luckily, I am too busy to deal with the likes of you, so clear off!~|~translationMissing
Actually, I have heard of you. You're famous in Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you. What do you want?~|~translationMissing
I was hoping we could talk more about your prisoner.~|~translationMissing
Until you join us, I can say little. What I can tell you is that he is very valuable. If all goes well, he will make us very rich.~|~translationMissing
Hi. Who are you guarding here?~|~translationMissing
Can't say. It's all very secret. You should get out of here. I am not supposed to talk while I guard.~|~translationMissing
Good work. Now, before breaking the Prince out, you'll need to find a way to deal with his personal guard. He's talkative, so try to find a weakness. Remember, we don't want any unneeded violence.~|~translationMissing
Alright. I'll go have a chat to this guard.~|~translationMissing
Before you go, my father sent this for you.~|~translationMissing
Leela gives you a key.~|~translationMissing
You're back. How are things going?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I lost that key you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Well that was foolish. I can sort you out with another, but it will cost you 15 coins.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 15 coins~|~translationMissing
I haven't got that much.~|~translationMissing
Then come back to me when you do.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 15 coins~|~translationMissing
Here, I have 15 coins.~|~translationMissing
Now, how are things going with that guard?~|~translationMissing
I haven't spoken to him yet.~|~translationMissing
Well you'd better get on it then. We need him out of the way.~|~translationMissing
I have some beer here. Fancy one?~|~translationMissing
Ah, that would be lovely. Only one though, just to wet my throat.~|~translationMissing
Of course. It must be tough being here without a drink.~|~translationMissing
You hand a beer to the guard. He drinks it in seconds.~|~translationMissing
That was perfect! I can't thank you enough.~|~translationMissing
How are you? Still okay? Not too drunk?~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than three beers~|~translationMissing
No, I don't get drunk from only one drink. I reckon I'd need at least two more for that. Still, thanks for the beer.~|~translationMissing
If the player has two more beers~|~translationMissing
Would you care for another beer, my friend?~|~translationMissing
I'd better not. I don't want to be drunk on duty.~|~translationMissing
Here, just keep these for later. I hate to see a thirsty guard.~|~translationMissing
You hand two more beers to the guard. He takes a sip of one, and then he quickly drinks them both.~|~translationMissing
Franksh! That wash jusht what I need to shtay on guard. No more beersh, I don't want to get drunk.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the life of a guard.~|~translationMissing
Well, the hours are good, but most of those hours are a drag.~|~translationMissing
Sometimes I wonder if I should have spent more time learning when I was a young boy. Maybe I wouldn't be here now, scared of Keli.~|~translationMissing
What did you want to be when you were a boy?~|~translationMissing
I'd better go.~|~translationMissing
Well, I loved to sit by the lake, with my toes in the water. I'd shoot the fish with my bow and arrow.~|~translationMissing
That's a strange hobby for a boy.~|~translationMissing
It kept us from goblin hunting, which was what most boys did.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... Why do you ask? What do you want?~|~translationMissing
Hey, chill out. I won't cause you trouble.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, it's hard to relax when I'm on duty. Stress of the job, and all.~|~translationMissing
So why do you do it?~|~translationMissing
There's good money in it, and some of the shouting I rather like.~|~translationMissing
RESISTANCE IS USELESS!~|~translationMissing
So what do you buy with your great wages?~|~translationMissing
Really, after working here, there's only time for a drink or three. All us guards go to the same pub and drink ourselves stupid.~|~translationMissing
It's what I enjoy these days. I can't resist the sight of a really cold beer.~|~translationMissing
Would you be interested in making a little more money?~|~translationMissing
What? Are you trying to bribe me? I may not be a great guard, but I am loyal. How dare you try to bribe me!~|~translationMissing
No, no, you've got the wrong idea, totally. I just wondered if you wanted some part-time bodyguard work.~|~translationMissing
Oh... sorry. No, I don't need money. As long as you were not offering me a bribe.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I appreciate that. Talking on duty can be punished by having your mouth stitched up. These are tough people, make no mistake.~|~translationMissing
Halt! Who goes there?~|~translationMissing
Hello friend. I'm just here to rescue the Prince, if thats okay?~|~translationMissing
Thatsh a funny joke. You are lucky I'm shober. Go in peace, friend.~|~translationMissing
You're back. How are things going with that guard?~|~translationMissing
I could attack him.~|~translationMissing
I don't think that's a good idea. Any violence could put the Prince at risk.~|~translationMissing
I might be able to get him drunk.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could bribe him to leave.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep thinking.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that could work. I'd imagine three beers would do it. Why don't you give it a try?~|~translationMissing
It would take a lot of gold to convince him to betray Keli. She's not known to be kind to those she believes to be traitors. Perhaps there's something else you could try.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure yet.~|~translationMissing
You should try talking to him. He might give away some sort of weakness.~|~translationMissing
He's been dealt with.~|~translationMissing
Great! I think that means we're ready. Go in and use some rope to tie Keli up. Once she's dealt with, use the key to free the Prince. Don't forget to give him his disguise so the guards outside don't spot him.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not ready~|~translationMissing
You cannot tie Keli up until you have all equipment and disabled the guard!~|~translationMissing
You'll need to deal with Lady Keli before freeing the Prince.~|~translationMissing
If the player used rope on Lady Keli~|~translationMissing
You overpower Keli, tie her up, and put her in a cupboard.~|~translationMissing
Prince Ali? I'm here to rescue you.~|~translationMissing
Prince Ali~|~translationMissing
Oh thank goodness! What's your plan?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a complete disguise and key~|~translationMissing
I've already dealt with Lady Keli and the guard. I'm going to get you a disguise so the guards outside don't spot you leaving. I'll be back once I have it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a complete disguise and key~|~translationMissing
Take this disguise. You can use it to get past the guards outside.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, my friend. I must leave you now, but my father will pay you well for this.~|~translationMissing
Prince Ali puts on the disguise and uses it to escape.~|~translationMissing
You did it! Prince Ali is now safe again. You should head back to Al Kharid. I expect you will be well rewarded for your work.~|~translationMissing
Prince Ali is safe once more. Chancellor Hassan has your payment.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, friend. I am forever in your debt for what you did, as is all of Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
I know my father is very grateful as well. If he were in better health, he would have thanked you personally. However, at his age, it is best that he spends his time resting.~|~translationMissing
I'm just happy to have helped. All the best.~|~translationMissing
Prince Ali is home safe. You have the eternal gratitude of the Emir for rescuing his son. Please, take this payment as a thank you.~|~translationMissing

Well, err...who are you, and what are all these bones doing here?~|~translationMissing
Mumblemumble~|~translationMissing
I'm an archaeologist. I work with the museum.~|~translationMissing
An archaeologist?~|~translationMissing
Well that explains the bones...sort of...but what are you doing all the way out here?~|~translationMissing
Mumblemumble. Mumblemumblemumble.~|~translationMissing
I'm collecting bones for the museum.~|~translationMissing
They have asked me to rig up some displays of second and third age creatures using their bones, so that people can come and...well, look at them.~|~translationMissing
I need to get them into some sort of order before I begin, but I've run into a bit of a snag.~|~translationMissing
What sort of a snag?~|~translationMissing
Well, I need to have all the bones I'm going to use here, and placed into some sort of order.~|~translationMissing
However, I seem to have discovered I am a few short.~|~translationMissing
Anything I can do to help?~|~translationMissing
There is something you could do for me. I'm going to be busy...err...~|~translationMissing
Mumble~|~translationMissing
Sorting, yes, sorting these bones out ready for the museum, but I need a few more.~|~translationMissing
Will you help me out by grabbing some?~|~translationMissing
Rag and Bone Man I is started.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'll give you a hand.~|~translationMissing
You will? Excellent!~|~translationMissing
Snicker.~|~translationMissing
Where do you need me to dig?~|~translationMissing
Dig?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you must have got the wrong end of the stick.~|~translationMissing
I need some fresh, whole bones to replace ones that have become damaged.~|~translationMissing
Mumblemumblemumblemumblemumble. Mumblemumblemumblemumble. Mumble.~|~translationMissing
Shhh!~|~translationMissing
Sorry...~|~translationMissing
Ok, got it.~|~translationMissing
Ok, here is the thing. While sorting out what bones I do have I managed to lose or damage a few. If you can get me some fresh, unbroken bones to use as replacements then I can get on with things.~|~translationMissing
That make things clearer?~|~translationMissing
Well, it makes some sense I suppose...~|~translationMissing
Great. If you can get me a bone from a Goblin, a Bear, a Big Frog, a Ram, a Unicorn, a Monkey, a Giant rat and a Giant Bat then I'll be able to move on with the...~|~translationMissing
Displays...~|~translationMissing
So you just want me to bring you these bones and that will be that?~|~translationMissing
Well, I wouldn't mind you sticking them in a pot and boiling them in vinegar first, if you don't mind.~|~translationMissing
There is a Wine Merchant in Draynor called Fortunato that sells the stuff you'll need.~|~translationMissing
You can even use my pot-boiler if you want.~|~translationMissing
Why do I need to boil them in vinegar?~|~translationMissing
It gets them bright and sparking white.~|~translationMissing
It's an archaeologist thing.~|~translationMissing
Just put the bone in a pot of vinegar, throw some logs on the fire, put the pot in the holder and light the logs.~|~translationMissing
It takes a while for the vinegar to evaporate, but the bone will be nice and clean in the end.~|~translationMissing
All right, I'll be back later.~|~translationMissing
Bye!~|~translationMissing
Oh...I see.~|~translationMissing
Well, never mind me young man, I'll just stagger over here under my massive burden, and continue my thankless task.~|~translationMissing
Unaided and alone...~|~translationMissing
Wow, trying a guilt trip much?~|~translationMissing
Well, good luck with that.~|~translationMissing
Well good luck with that!~|~translationMissing
Thanks stranger!~|~translationMissing
What a polite young man...~|~translationMissing
Well, back to work!~|~translationMissing
Where is that mumbling coming from?~|~translationMissing
What mumbling?~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I have enough problems of my own without dealing with a delusional adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Sniggersnigger~|~translationMissing
I was just passing and I wondered if you still needed someone to help with the bones?~|~translationMissing
Fortunato~|~translationMissing
Can I help you at all?~|~translationMissing
Have you got any vinegar?~|~translationMissing
Vinegar?~|~translationMissing
Vinegar!~|~translationMissing
The very idea! My wines are the finest in the district!~|~translationMissing
Sorry! I was told to come and speak with a wine merchant about getting some vinegar, I must have the wrong person.~|~translationMissing
Wait...did HE send you?~|~translationMissing
If by HE you mean the old man with the sack of bones, then yes.~|~translationMissing
Aaaah...say no more sir, I have some in specially.~|~translationMissing
Ah! Good afternoon your lordship. I take it you have come for a refill?~|~translationMissing
Wine Shop. opens.~|~translationMissing
Not today~|~translationMissing
Not today.~|~translationMissing
Well, just remember I have some in stock for you when you want it.~|~translationMissing
Depending on what you have already handed in, but do not have any~|~translationMissing
Have you brought me any bones?~|~translationMissing
Not at the moment. Can you just give me a run down on which bones I have left to get?~|~translationMissing
Sure.~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Goblin bone.~|~translationMissing
Goblins are relatively common. I hear there is a house full of them around Lumbridge in fact.~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Bear bone.~|~translationMissing
I heard that there are some Bears over by the Legends' Guild, near Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Big Frog bone.~|~translationMissing
This might be a little tricky as you will need to go into the Lumbridge Swamp caves. You will need a light source! Never forget your light source down there!~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Ram bone.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you will be able to find a ram wherever there are sheep.~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Unicorn bone.~|~translationMissing
I seem to remember that there were Unicorns south of Varrock, I think they might be there still.~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Monkey bone.~|~translationMissing
Monkeys tend to live in Jungle areas, like Karamja. I think they are pretty plentiful there if I remember correctly.~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Giant Rat bone.~|~translationMissing
If you can't find one in a sewer, then you might want to try looking in some caves.~|~translationMissing
You still need to bring me a Giant Bat bone.~|~translationMissing
Giant bats tend to live underground, but I have heard there are a few near the Coal Pits.~|~translationMissing
Did you get all that?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'll get right on it.~|~translationMissing
Don't forget to boil them in vinegar first.~|~translationMissing
Just chuck some logs into the pit, put the bone in the pot of vinegar and drop it onto the pot-boiler. Then light the logs and wait for the the vinegar to boil away.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll remember.~|~translationMissing
I have some bones for you.~|~translationMissing
Great! Let me take a look at them.~|~translationMissing
That's the last of them!~|~translationMissing
The museum will be thrilled to know I've completed the collection.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm just glad I could help.~|~translationMissing
Well you've been a big help and no mistake.~|~translationMissing
I'm always on the lookout for fresh bones, so if you see some bring them right over.~|~translationMissing
No problem, I'll be sure to bring anything you might like over if I find something.~|~translationMissing

4.10 Using the fishcake on Pirate Pete~|~translationMissing
How would I go about protecting this nautical fellow from the curse of the culinaromancer then?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... Wait a moment, my fortune-teller-sense is tingling...~|~translationMissing
Erm... okay...~|~translationMissing
Ah yes. To immunise him from the culinaromancer's attack, you will need to feed him fishcakes.~|~translationMissing
Fishcakes? What, like chocolate cake with fish instead of chocolate?~|~translationMissing
No... Like small bread crumbed fishy delicacies.~|~translationMissing
Um... So how would I make those then?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I am a fortune-teller, not a cook.~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose it occurred to you to ask the actual cook in the room right next door to us?~|~translationMissing
Ooooh yeah... I'll be right back!~|~translationMissing
Err... have you forgotten about the fishcakes already?~|~translationMissing
I might have, I might not have.~|~translationMissing
This time-travelling stuff just has me a little worn out ok?~|~translationMissing
To immunise him from the culinaromancer's attack, you will need to feed him fishcakes.~|~translationMissing
And try not to forget this time!~|~translationMissing
Can we talk about what happened in the dining room?~|~translationMissing
Wow! You were incredible! The way you defeated the Culinaromancer, you made it seem so easy!~|~translationMissing
Uh... What?~|~translationMissing
With the foods, and that big portal thingy, and everything!~|~translationMissing
I'm just glad you were around, who knows WHAT could have happened if you weren't able to help us!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I don't have any clue what you...~|~translationMissing
Oh. Oh, right. This must be part of that whole time-bubble thing that Aris told me about.~|~translationMissing
So the cook outside of the bubble remembers me having already saved the council members even though I haven't actually gone and done it yet...~|~translationMissing
Gah! This time travel stuff makes my head hurt!~|~translationMissing
So... I don't suppose you can remember exactly how I defeated him can you?~|~translationMissing
Of course! Which bit can't you remember doing?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Protecting the Dwarf~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Protecting the Goblins~|~translationMissing
Protecting the Pirate~|~translationMissing
I can't quite remember how I managed to save that pirate...~|~translationMissing
The pirate? Yes, you used fishcakes didn't you?~|~translationMissing
I did? Er... I mean I did.~|~translationMissing
Out of interest, could you just help me quickly with that?~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me how to make fishcakes?~|~translationMissing
Fishcakes? As in with fish eggs and fish milk?~|~translationMissing
Don't be silly, that would never work.~|~translationMissing
Can you check to see if there is a recipe for them?~|~translationMissing
The Chef checks one of his cookbooks.~|~translationMissing
Found it!~|~translationMissing
Apparently you need Ground Cod, Ground Kelp, Ground Giant Crab Meat and Breadcrumbs.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get Ground Cod?~|~translationMissing
Well, if you use a pestle and mortar on a raw cod that will grind it up nicely.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get Ground Kelp?~|~translationMissing
Where do I get Ground kelp?~|~translationMissing
There are apparently some kelp patches off the coast near Rimmington. Murphy knows more about that.~|~translationMissing
As for the grinding part, all you have to do is use a pestle and mortar on it, that ought to get it sorted.~|~translationMissing
Murphy also used to bring in Giant Crabs occasionally. He hasn't had any of them in for a while though.~|~translationMissing
You had best go and have a word with him to see if he can tell you what happened.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get Ground Giant Crab Meat?~|~translationMissing
Where do I get Ground Giant Crab meat?~|~translationMissing
Well, Murphy used to bring in Giant Crabs occasionally. He hasn't had any of them in for a while though.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and  there are apparently some kelp patches off the coast near Rimmington. Murphy knows about that too.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get Breadcrumbs?~|~translationMissing
That's easy, all you do is use a knife to slice the bread up into tiny, tiny chunks.~|~translationMissing
What do I do with all of it?~|~translationMissing
What did I do with all of it?~|~translationMissing
I'm not entirely sure. What am I, an encyclopedia?~|~translationMissing
I'll have a look through my cookbook while I wait for the ingredients.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go out and get all of the stuff and bring it to you.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else you need to know?~|~translationMissing
(If the player has asked at least one question) Thanks!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) More...~|~translationMissing
Talk about Recipe for Disaster.~|~translationMissing
Murphy, what can you tell me about giant crabs?~|~translationMissing
Murphy~|~translationMissing
Giant Crabs? Why, I used to haul up a few of those whenever I set my nets around Rimmington.~|~translationMissing
Why the interest?~|~translationMissing
I need to get some Giant Crab Meat and Kelp. Can you tell me where I can get some?~|~translationMissing
Well, the only thing I can think to do is to go down there and look to see if there are any left.~|~translationMissing
Go down there? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
As in under the water!~|~translationMissing
Tell me, can you get your hands on a fishbowl?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I will be able to if I put my mind to it, why do you ask?~|~translationMissing
Well, I know how to rig up a handy set of breathing gear that can allow you to keep air inside the fishbowl.~|~translationMissing
You just put the barrel of air on your back, with the fishbowl over your head, and then dive over the side.~|~translationMissing
It should hold enough air to keep you alive for quite some time.~|~translationMissing
That sounds pretty dangerous...~|~translationMissing
Not at all. I'll even weigh anchor with the chain somewhere easy to reach so you can climb out easily enough if you run into trouble.~|~translationMissing
I'm still not happy about this...~|~translationMissing
Well, I can't think of any other way to check. If you come up with a better plan then feel free to tell me.~|~translationMissing
In the meantime I'll wait, and if you want me to take you diving I'll be ready.~|~translationMissing
By the way, why are you so interested in crabs all of a sudden?~|~translationMissing
I can't tell you I'm afraid. The very fabric of space and time could collapse!~|~translationMissing
O...k...~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess some people will do anything for a bit of fresh seafood.~|~translationMissing
Ahoy there! Up for a bit of a swim?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a fishbowl~|~translationMissing
Well, whenever you want me to get you some diving gear, just come and see me with a fishbowl.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a fishbowl~|~translationMissing
I certainly am.~|~translationMissing
Great! I'll sort that fishbowl out for you.~|~translationMissing
Murphy attaches some tubes to the backpack and the fishbowl and puts a rubber hood inside.~|~translationMissing
There you go.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure this is safe?~|~translationMissing
Sure! It's as sound as my ship!~|~translationMissing
Want me to take you out now?~|~translationMissing
Yes, Let's go diving.~|~translationMissing
Well I can't take you out until you are properly geared up.~|~translationMissing
We lost three diving parties that way!~|~translationMissing
Ok, well I'll just put my diving helmet and diving backpack on.~|~translationMissing
Ok, well I'll be here if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost their diving helmet~|~translationMissing
Murphy, can I get another diving helmet?~|~translationMissing
Well sure, just as soon as you have some spare space for it.~|~translationMissing
Sure, here you go. Try not to lose this one, I'm not a very good glassblower.~|~translationMissing
Well, the bowls I make tend to shatter under pressure into razor-sharp shards of lethal, face shredding shrapnel.~|~translationMissing
Don't let it bother you, I think I know what I'm doing wrong now.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost their diving apparatus~|~translationMissing
Hello Murphy. Do you have a spare diving backpack?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I have plenty after the...little incident.~|~translationMissing
What 'little incident'?~|~translationMissing
Nothing to worry yourself about.~|~translationMissing
Well, I have plenty of them under the tap, getting sluiced off. When you have space for one come and see me.~|~translationMissing
Here, have this one. Only dropped once!~|~translationMissing
Is that blood?~|~translationMissing
No, no.~|~translationMissing
Well, yes.~|~translationMissing
But seriously, what are the chances of getting a jellyfish jammed in there again?~|~translationMissing
If the player has all their equipment~|~translationMissing
Ahoy there! All set for a dive?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the diving equipment on~|~translationMissing
If the player weighs more than 27kg~|~translationMissing
Well that's the sort of spirit I like to see. However you are far too heavy to go diving right now.~|~translationMissing
Well, I can't take you diving if you are carrying more than 27kg worth of equipment.~|~translationMissing
We arrived at that number through trial and error, and the errors were not pretty let me assure you.~|~translationMissing
So what can I do?~|~translationMissing
Well, if you pop over to a bank and leave all your heavy equipment behind then I'll take you out.~|~translationMissing
See you then!~|~translationMissing
If the player is properly equipped~|~translationMissing
Ok, let's be off then.~|~translationMissing
(Cutscene plays of Murphy taking the player out on a boat.)~|~translationMissing
Ok, see you soon Murphy!~|~translationMissing
Good luck, I'll weigh anchor. Climb up the chain to get aboard.~|~translationMissing
You have no idea what is in there, best leave it for the time being.~|~translationMissing

Seriously, I need to get that meat. I'll do your big favour if you want.~|~translationMissing
Hah! Silly round head fishy! If you get Nung 5 big skippy skins, den maybe Nung thinking you ok.~|~translationMissing
Big skippy skins?~|~translationMissing

You do dis, den maybe Nung let you swaps da big crunchy claws.~|~translationMissing
Hey fishy! You gots da skippy skins?~|~translationMissing
Den no crunchy claws for you!~|~translationMissing
If the player is holding less than 5 rocks~|~translationMissing
You pick up a rock and put it in your pocket.~|~translationMissing
If the player picks up a 6th rock~|~translationMissing
You have enough rocks to stand on the sea bed if you need to.~|~translationMissing
You take some Kelp.~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't collected 5 rocks~|~translationMissing
You need to collect 5 rocks to get into the pen.~|~translationMissing
If the player has enough rocks~|~translationMissing
You enter the cave...~|~translationMissing
You exit the cave.~|~translationMissing
You kick off the sea bed and begin swimming again.~|~translationMissing
Nung, I have your giant Mudskipper Skins.~|~translationMissing
What you say? Has da silly round headed fishy got da big skippy skins?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have the big skippy skins.~|~translationMissing
Silly round head fishy done good!  Gimme!~|~translationMissing
If the player has given Nung fewer than 5 hides~|~translationMissing
Ya, dis fishy is a good fishy, but it no count good like Nung! Nung say dere are dis many hides left for da fishy to get.~|~translationMissing
Nung holds up [number] of his fingers.~|~translationMissing

But it not be easy~|~translationMissing
Well I'll do it. What do I need? An item of ancient power? Something from the deepest, darkest dungeon in the world?~|~translationMissing
What sort of monsters will I need to fight? I'd best grab myself some potions too.~|~translationMissing
Will there be traps? Should I bring cakes?~|~translationMissing
Ya, it real dangerous for a fishy.~|~translationMissing
You's gotta go up to da topsies, and your gotta get a needly-thing and some wirey stuff.~|~translationMissing

Hey! Nung says no fishies...~|~translationMissing
I just spoke to Nung, he said it was ok.~|~translationMissing
Well...if Nung say it ok, den go ahead.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough rocks~|~translationMissing
You try to enter the pen, but the current is too strong.~|~translationMissing
With the rocks in your pocket you can quite easily land on the sea bed.~|~translationMissing
It is a little slippery, but you should be able to fight normally.~|~translationMissing
You kick off from the sea bed and begin swimming again.~|~translationMissing
If the player is holding any rocks~|~translationMissing
You have to drop all of your rocks to surface.~|~translationMissing

I have all the ingredients for fishcakes!~|~translationMissing
Great! Just like before! I've been reading the recipe and I know how to make the fishcakes now.~|~translationMissing
It's pretty simple actually. All you have to do is use the ingredients on each other and then cook the fishcakes on a range.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I thought that there was a page missing from the cookbook because it seemed so easy, but it turns out it really IS that easy!~|~translationMissing
You mix all the ingredients together to make an uncooked fishcake.~|~translationMissing
You manage to cook a fishcake.~|~translationMissing
Stop messing about and use the fishcakes on him!~|~translationMissing
Good work adventurer, I've teleported them away to safety! You only have [number] council members left to protect!~|~translationMissing

To protect this noble knight from the magic of the culinaromancer, you will have to give him a creme brulee.~|~translationMissing
Not just any creme brulee mind you, but a creme brulee supreme!~|~translationMissing
Well that doesn't sound too hard. What's so supreme about a creme brulee supreme?~|~translationMissing
Are you going to constantly ask me questions?~|~translationMissing
I am a fortune-teller, not a cook, and again I would suggest you speak to the cook next door who will be much more helpful on such culinary matters.~|~translationMissing
Although I happen to know that one of the ingredients is the egg of the evil chicken.~|~translationMissing
The evil chicken? Great. He only ever seems to show up when I don't want him to.~|~translationMissing
I believe the wise old man in Draynor has studied the Evil Chicken.~|~translationMissing
I would suggest you speak to him to get you on the right track. And tell him Bubbykins says hi.~|~translationMissing
Er... Bubbykins?~|~translationMissing
That is not important right now. Go! Protect Sir Amik from the magic that threatens his life, my spell will only hold so long!~|~translationMissing
Just give me 5 minutes and I'll be back!~|~translationMissing
Could you give me that recipe again, please?~|~translationMissing
Certainly, forgetful hero.~|~translationMissing

Protecting Sir Amik Varze~|~translationMissing
That white knight... Sir Amik Varze... I can't quite remember how I saved him...~|~translationMissing
but it was something to do with creme brulee supreme...~|~translationMissing
Ah yes! Why, I was so impressed with that recipe you created that I memorised it!~|~translationMissing
Ah, you did, did you? I don't suppose you could refresh my memory about that?~|~translationMissing
But of course! It was an unusual dish, an unusual dish indeed! First you blend together, in a pot, some milk and some cream. Then add cornflour to the mixture.~|~translationMissing
Cornflour? How do I... er, how DID I make that then?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you told me you used sweetcorn in a mill!~|~translationMissing
Really? Weird. Okay, what did I do then?~|~translationMissing
Then you travelled to the Kharazi Jungle and searched the plants there until you found a vanilla stick, which was then added to the mixture.~|~translationMissing
After that you told me that you sought out and killed the fearsome Evil Chicken, to get one of his eggs, which was then mixed with the other ingredients.~|~translationMissing
Finally you made some cinnamon by grinding the branch of a Dramen Tree and sprinkled it on top of the creme brulee.~|~translationMissing
Sounds easy enough so far. Er, I mean it was easy enough up to that point.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but then came the impressive part!~|~translationMissing
Apparently, a creme brulee supreme needs to be flambed at exactly the right temperature, and the only fire that is hot enough to do this is the breath of a dragon. Luckily, while killing black dragons near the Evil~|~translationMissing
Chicken's lair, you came across a method of forcing a dragon to your will so that it would complete the dish, which you then used to protect Sir Amik!~|~translationMissing
I definitely said that I had to kill some black dragons to do that?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. You were quite adamant about it. Specifically black dragons. Specifically near the Evil Chicken's lair.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah... I remember now...~|~translationMissing
Did you want a reminder on any other of your brave exploits?~|~translationMissing

So you're a wise old man, huh?~|~translationMissing
Less of the 'old' man, if you please!~|~translationMissing
But yes, I suppose you could say that. I prefer to think of myself as a sage.~|~translationMissing
So what's a sage doing here?~|~translationMissing
I've spent most of my life studying this world in which we live. I've strode through the depths of the deadliest dungeons, roamed the murky jungles of Karamja, meditated on the glories of Saradomin on Entrana,~|~translationMissing
and read dusty tomes in the Library of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Now I'm not as young as I used to be, I'm settling here where it's peaceful.~|~translationMissing
It's a pity about that vampyre that keeps attacking the village. At least Saradomin protects me.~|~translationMissing
That's quite an exciting life you've had.~|~translationMissing
Exciting? Yes, I suppose so.~|~translationMissing
Now I'm here, perhaps I could offer you the benefit of my experience and wisdom?~|~translationMissing
Thanks! So how can you help me?~|~translationMissing
Well, I imagine you've gathered up quite a lot of stuff on your travels. Things you used for quests a long time ago that you don't need now.~|~translationMissing
If you like, I can look through your bank and see if there's anything you can chuck away.~|~translationMissing
Alternatively, you can bring items here and show them to me. If I see that it's something you don't need, I'll let you know. I might even be willing to buy it.~|~translationMissing
So you'll help me clear junk out of my bank?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. Or I'd be happy to chat with you about the wonders of this world!~|~translationMissing
What would you like to say?~|~translationMissing

The Evil Chicken~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me about the Evil Chicken, please?~|~translationMissing
The Evil Chicken! Many are the myths and legends surrounding this foul bird. Some say that it is the result of a mad mage's attempt to summon a demon, others say that it was once a~|~translationMissing
normal chicken that realised how limited its farmyard life was. It threw off its chains and attempted to unite the other chickens in revenge against their human captors.~|~translationMissing
When that failed the Evil Chicken grew angry with its brethren and swore to kill any human or chicken that it ever encountered again!~|~translationMissing
It is whispered that there is a coven of witches that meet, on the night of the full moon in the fabled fairy kingdom, to worship this bird and that they can summon it to do their twisted will!~|~translationMissing
Right, so if you were looking for the chicken where would you go?~|~translationMissing
I would start in the lands of the fairies, possibly there is some truth in the rumours of summoning the chicken there. Actually, I've done further research, it may be around~|~translationMissing
here somewhere, if you're really thinking of going there you should be extremely careful, it's claimed that the chicken has forced some very powerful creatures to guard his lair.~|~translationMissing

K'klik~|~translationMissing
Who are you? You're not the hero I gave my token to!~|~translationMissing
How did you get that coin you used to summon me?~|~translationMissing
I took it from the dead body of a black dragon.~|~translationMissing
I didn't realise what it would do if I rubbed it.~|~translationMissing
Who, or what, are you anyway?~|~translationMissing
My name is K'klik. I am a Fairy Dragon.~|~translationMissing
One of the last surviving members of my race, I fear.~|~translationMissing
Enough of that~|~translationMissing
you summoned me, so how can I help?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't understand.~|~translationMissing
The person who holds my token can summon me by rubbing it.~|~translationMissing
They then have the right to request one thing of me before returning my token.~|~translationMissing
So I can ask one thing of you?~|~translationMissing
That's right. What do you want?~|~translationMissing
What will you ask for?~|~translationMissing
(If the player is holding the brulee~|~translationMissing
) Please flambe this creme brulee for me.~|~translationMissing
Please flambe this creme brulee for me.~|~translationMissing
Sure, that's easy.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing ice gloves~|~translationMissing
I think you need to wear some sort of protective gloves, otherwise I'll flamb? your arm.~|~translationMissing
Go ahead, I'll be fine.~|~translationMissing
Okay, if you're sure.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing an anti-dragon shield~|~translationMissing
Your shield absorbs most of the dragon fire!~|~translationMissing
The dragon's token has vanished from your backpack.~|~translationMissing
What gloves do you have in mind?~|~translationMissing
A pair of ice gloves should do the trick.~|~translationMissing
I'll go fetch them then.~|~translationMissing
Could I just keep your token for when I really need it, please?~|~translationMissing
I suppose that seems fair. Alright, just call me when you need me.~|~translationMissing
Can I wish for some xp?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, can't help. You'll have to ask the genie for that.~|~translationMissing
I'd like a horse, please.~|~translationMissing
No horses in Gielinor. Try again.~|~translationMissing
You mix the pot of cream and the milk together.~|~translationMissing
You mix the cornflour into the milk and cream mixture.~|~translationMissing
You add the vanilla pod to the brulee mixture.~|~translationMissing
You mix in the Evil Chicken's egg.~|~translationMissing
You grind the branch into powder.~|~translationMissing
You sprinkle cinnamon on top of the brulee mixture. Now it just needs flambeing.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you want to empty that pot?~|~translationMissing
You empty the contents of the pot onto the floor.~|~translationMissing
Congratulations, you have saved Sir Amik Varze.~|~translationMissing

6.2 Speaking with King Lathas~|~translationMissing
I received your message my liege. How may I serve the kingdom?~|~translationMissing
Ahh... adventurer. The repair work on the Well of Voyage has been completed. We're finally ready to move against my brother.~|~translationMissing
I assume you have a plan?~|~translationMissing
I do indeed. I recently managed to make contact with the elves that inhabit the western lands.~|~translationMissing
Elves? I?ve never seen an elf before.~|~translationMissing
Well that may well change soon. Apparently, my brother has been causing them quite a bit of trouble. As such, they've agreed to help us get rid of him once and for all.~|~translationMissing
So what do I need to do?~|~translationMissing
You are to head into the Underground Pass and through the Well of Voyage. Lord Iorwerth, the leader of the elves, will send some representatives to meet you on the other side.~|~translationMissing
With their help, you are to find my brother and kill him. Once that's done, return to me.~|~translationMissing
Start the Regicide quest?~|~translationMissing
Very well. Anything else I should know?~|~translationMissing
My brother may not be the only threat you face. I hear the elves are currently dealing with a rebellion. The rebels likely won't take kindly to you working with their enemy so be on the look out.~|~translationMissing
I see. I'll be careful.~|~translationMissing
Good luck adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't think I'm ready for this yet.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. Return to me when you are ready and we will begin.~|~translationMissing
What's the deal with your brother again?~|~translationMissing
My brother, King Tyras, was always a bit of an explorer. He went on numerous expeditions to the lands west of here. On one of these expeditions, he was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
The Dark Lord agreed to spare his life, but only on one condition... That he would drink from the Chalice of Eternity. The chalice corrupted him. He joined forces with the Dark Lord, the embodiment of pure evil?~|~translationMissing
As a result, I had a wall built around West Ardougne to act as a barrier between him and the rest of the world. Tyras is king of West Ardougne, sealing off the city was the only way to stop him and the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
But now we?re ready to stop him.~|~translationMissing
Indeed we are. My brother has been gathering strength in the west, preparing to move against us. But now that we have a way through, we can move against him first.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Do you have a plan in place?~|~translationMissing
Sounds good. See you later.~|~translationMissing
Farewell adventurer. Return to me once you are ready to begin.~|~translationMissing
Idris~|~translationMissing
Halt human! What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Wait! What was that? What the...~|~translationMissing
Morvran~|~translationMissing
Are you the human by the name of [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Yes that's me.~|~translationMissing
Good... We've been expecting you. King Lathas sent word of your coming.~|~translationMissing
You should speak with Lord Iorwerth. He will help you track down that brigand Tyras. You'll find his camp in the north west of the forest.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I'm [player name]. Your scouts said that I should come and see you.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth~|~translationMissing
Ahh... [player name]. Welcome to Tirannwn. I understand you've been sent here to rid us of that criminal Tyras. I offer my full support.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, most of my troops are currently dealing with a group of renegade elves. That does mean we're a bit more limited than we otherwise would be.~|~translationMissing
I see. I'll need to play this smart then.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Now, Tyras and his forces moved camp recently so your first step will be to find their new camp. I have a tracker currently working in that area. I suggest you join up with him.~|~translationMissing
You'll find him at Tyras's old camp. It's south east of here, just north of that poisoned lake. Once you've found the camp, come and let me know.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I shall return when my task is complete.~|~translationMissing
Elf Tracker~|~translationMissing
Human! You must be one of Tyras's men...~|~translationMissing
No I'm [player name]! Lord Iorwerth said you might be able to help me.~|~translationMissing
And you have something to prove this?~|~translationMissing
Well... Err... No.~|~translationMissing
As I was saying... I have no time for brigands or outlaws.~|~translationMissing
Good day [player name]. How may I help you now?~|~translationMissing
Your scout refused to help. He asked for proof that you sent me.~|~translationMissing
Bless his loyalty but curse his suspicion. Here he will recognise this.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth gives you a crystal pendant.~|~translationMissing
You show the tracker the crystal pendant.~|~translationMissing
That's Lord Iorwerth's pendant. He must have a lot of faith in you. Now, what is it I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
I need to find Tyras and kill him. Do you know where his camp is?~|~translationMissing
Well this was his old camp. After the battle a few days ago they moved. We're yet to find them again.~|~translationMissing
As it goes I'm not actually tracking them at the moment. I'm currently trying to trace our renegade brethren instead. This here is the best lead we've found so far.~|~translationMissing
Ahh I guess you can't see it with those human eyes.~|~translationMissing
I tell you what. Now that you're here I may as well give you a hand. I'll search here on the east side. You check out the west end of the camp. Come and tell me if you find anything.~|~translationMissing
I've found tracks leading off to the west. But they trail off into the trees. Beyond that I am unable to follow.~|~translationMissing
These forests aren't always as dense as you'd think. If you look closer, you might see ways that you can get through. With that in mind, why don't you give it another go?~|~translationMissing
Thanks... I'll see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
How goes the hunt for that bandit camp?~|~translationMissing
I found it a short distance west of here.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure Lord Iorwerth will be pleased to hear that. You should let him know.~|~translationMissing
[player name] how goes your search... Any luck hunting down that brigand?~|~translationMissing
I've finally tracked the brute down. His camp is in a secluded bit of forest, almost directly south of here.~|~translationMissing
Good job. As we don't have the troops available to take on his forces directly, I suggest we try some alternative tactics.~|~translationMissing
I have this book here which details an explosive reaction. We should be able to use it to create a bomb.~|~translationMissing
Well that should make short work of Tyras.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Have a read through and see what you think. Once you have, let me know if you have any questions.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth gives you a book.~|~translationMissing
Good day [player name]. Have you had any luck with that book?~|~translationMissing
I need some quicklime.~|~translationMissing
Quicklime?~|~translationMissing
Apparently it's made by heating limestone.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see. There's a mine directly east of here where you can mine limestone.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else I can help with?~|~translationMissing
I need some sulphur.~|~translationMissing
Check the shore south of the old camp you were at earlier. I've seen sulphur there in the past, it comes from that poisoned lake.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good, thanks.~|~translationMissing
I need some naphtha.~|~translationMissing
Naphtha?~|~translationMissing
According to the book, you get it through the fractional distillation of coal tar.~|~translationMissing
Well you should be able to get some coal tar from that poisoned lake to the south. As for the rest, I'm afraid I don't have the chemistry knowledge to understand it.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I know someone from Ardougne who might be able to help. She knows a thing or two about chemistry.~|~translationMissing
Perfect! Take the book to her and see if she can help. Just don't tell her what it's for. Even if she's trustworthy, we can't take any risks.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, is there anything else I can help with?~|~translationMissing
I need a barrel.~|~translationMissing
Have a look around the camp, there should be some empty barrels lying around.~|~translationMissing
I need a fuse.~|~translationMissing
Some sort of fabric should work. You can use the loom here if needed.~|~translationMissing
That's all thanks.~|~translationMissing
Let me know if you need anything else.~|~translationMissing
Good day. I was hoping you could help me with something. I have a book which mentions the fractional distillation of coal tar. I don't know how to do that though.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you'll be wanting to use the still then. It's just outside.~|~translationMissing
How do I use it?~|~translationMissing
It's quite simple really. You have to get the still heat up very high for it to work. However, if it gets too hot it will burn out and you will have to start over.~|~translationMissing
You must also watch the pressure, if it gets too high you will also have to start over. There are valves to control pressure and tar flow. These will also affect the heat of the still.~|~translationMissing
Is that all?~|~translationMissing
You'll also need plenty of coal to keep the still hot.~|~translationMissing
I see, thanks for the information.~|~translationMissing
Tyras guard~|~translationMissing
Yeah, what ya want?~|~translationMissing
I was wondering what you were doing out here?~|~translationMissing
I was just wondering what I was doing here too. I'm meant to be looking after this catapult but I can't keep my mind on the job. We've been living off field rations for almost a year now.~|~translationMissing
I keep seeing rabbits in this forest. What I wouldn't give to eat one, but I'm not quick enough to kill any and I'm no good with a bow.~|~translationMissing
Well I have one here for you.~|~translationMissing
You cooked me a rabbit! Thanks a lot. You don't mind watching things while I take five to eat it, do you?~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth, it is done.~|~translationMissing
Good good... One of my scouts reported that they saw his tent in a ball of flames. You have done well.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you will want to get back to your king and tell him. He will undoubtedly want some proof. He should trust me enough in this matter, Give him this letter, it verifies that the job is done.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth gives you a scroll.~|~translationMissing
As a token of my own thanks, I give you access to the pass through Arandar. You'll find the start of the trail in the far north east of the woods.~|~translationMissing
Thank you my lord.~|~translationMissing
Good day Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
Have you delivered the message to King Lathas yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet my lord.~|~translationMissing
There is no time for delay, he'll need to see it.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth, I have lost the message for King Lathas.~|~translationMissing
Here have another copy, but don't let it fall into the wrong hands.~|~translationMissing
Thank you Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
Are you the human by the name [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's me?~|~translationMissing
Thank Seren, maybe all is not yet lost.~|~translationMissing
I am Arianwyn, leader of the Elven Resistance. We've been watching you since you arrived in Tirannwn. We know it was you that murdered King Tyras.~|~translationMissing
There is much to explain and little time. You carry a message from Lord Iorwerth, do you not?~|~translationMissing
Well you seem to know everything else so I'll not lie. Yes.~|~translationMissing
Good, we understand each other well. Now hand it here and find the truth of who your real employer is.~|~translationMissing
You show the message to the elf, he moves his lips silently and the seal on the message is parted.~|~translationMissing
(Opens Iorwerth's message.)~|~translationMissing
I had no idea! Why would the king do this?~|~translationMissing
I have a few ideas, now is not the time to discuss them though. For now, you should go to King Lathas as normal. Give him the message and act like nothing unusual has happened.~|~translationMissing
Once you are done, return to Tirannwn and seek out Islwyn and Eluned. You'll find them roaming the Isafdar forest. They will bring you to me.~|~translationMissing
You want me to help you? Okay, what's in it for me?~|~translationMissing
The chance for redemption after all you've done? If that doesn't take your fancy, consider this...~|~translationMissing
This isn't a struggle for land or title. It is a war for life, all life. If Iorwerth and Lathas manage to summon Zamorak, we all die.~|~translationMissing
Deliver your message, act normal. We'll meet again soon.~|~translationMissing
My lord, Tyras is dead!~|~translationMissing
This is grand news indeed! You'll forgive me if I'm a little apprehensive about this, but I take it you do have proof?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have a letter sent by Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
You hand the king the message. He looks at the seal then opens it.~|~translationMissing
Yes... Good... This will do nicely. Well done, you've done an excellent job.~|~translationMissing
Does this mean we can reveal the truth about the plague?~|~translationMissing
Not yet I'm afraid. Even with my brother gone, the Dark Lord remains a threat. For now, the plague must remain.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'll send word when I next require your services. Oh, and I guess you'll be wanting your reward.~|~translationMissing

Blub! Blub...where is my Juliet? Have you seen her?~|~translationMissing
Looking for a blonde girl, goes by the name of Juliet..quite pretty...haven't seen her have you?~|~translationMissing
Juliet, Juliet, wherefore art thou Juliet? Have you seen my Juliet?~|~translationMissing
Oh woe is me that I cannot find my Juliet! You haven't seen Juliet have you?~|~translationMissing
Sadness surrounds me now that Juliet's father forbids us to meet. Have you seen my Juliet?~|~translationMissing
What is to become of me and my darling Juliet, I cannot find her anywhere, have you seen her?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have seen her actually!~|~translationMissing
At least, I think it was her... Blonde? A bit stressed?~|~translationMissing
Golly...yes, yes...you make her sound very interesting!~|~translationMissing
And I'll bet she's a bit of a fox!~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess she could be considered attractive...~|~translationMissing
I'll bet she is! Wooooooooo!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, all that jubilation has made me forget what we were talking about.~|~translationMissing
You were asking me about Juliet? You seemed to know her?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, Juliet!~|~translationMissing
The fox...could you tell her that she is the love of my long and that I life to be with her?~|~translationMissing
What? Surely you mean that she is the love of your life and that you long to be with her?~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah...what you said...tell her that, it sounds much better! Oh you're so good at this!~|~translationMissing
Yes, ok, I'll let her know.~|~translationMissing
Sorry Romeo, I've got better things to do right now but maybe later?~|~translationMissing
No sorry, I haven't seen her.~|~translationMissing
Oh...well, that's a shame...I was rather hoping you had.~|~translationMissing
Why? Is she a fugitive? Does she owe you some money or something?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, she might do? Perhaps she does? How do you know?~|~translationMissing
I don't know? I was asking 'YOU' how 'YOU' know Juliet!~|~translationMissing
Ahh, yes Juliet, she's my one true love. Well, one of my one true loves! If you see her, could you tell her that she is the love of my long and that I life to be with her?~|~translationMissing
What? Surely you mean that 'she is the love of your life and that you long to be with her?'~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I could help to find her for you?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I can help find her for you? What does she look like?~|~translationMissing
Oh would you? That would be great! She has this sort of hair...~|~translationMissing
Hair...check..~|~translationMissing
...and she these...great lips...~|~translationMissing
Lips...right.~|~translationMissing
Oh and she has these lovely shoulders as well..~|~translationMissing
Shoulders...right, so she has hair, lips and shoulders...that should cut it down a bit.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, Juliet is very different...please tell her that she is the love of my long and that I life to be with her?~|~translationMissing
Oh great! And tell her that I want to kiss her a give.~|~translationMissing
You mean you want to give her a kiss!~|~translationMissing
Oh you're good...you are good!~|~translationMissing
I see I've picked a true professional...!~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Juliet?~|~translationMissing
Why do you ask?~|~translationMissing
So that I can try and find her for you!~|~translationMissing
Ah yes....quite right. Hmmm, let me think now.~|~translationMissing
She may still be locked away at her Father's house on the sest vide of Warrock.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I remember how she loved it when I would sing up to her balcony! She would reward me with her own personal items...~|~translationMissing
What, she just gave you her stuff?~|~translationMissing
Well, not exactly give...more like 'throw with considerable force'...she's always a kidder that Juliet!~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else you can tell me about Juliet?~|~translationMissing
Oh, there is so much to tell...she is my true love, we intend to spend together forever...I can tell you so much about her..~|~translationMissing
Ermmm.....~|~translationMissing
So much can I tell you...~|~translationMissing
Yes..~|~translationMissing
So much to tell...why, where do I start!~|~translationMissing
Yes..yes! Please go on...don't let me interrupt...~|~translationMissing
You can't remember can you?~|~translationMissing
Not a thing sorry....~|~translationMissing
Oh, ok, well, I guess my Juliet and I can spend some time apart. And as the old saying goes, 'Absinthe makes the heart glow longer'.~|~translationMissing
Don't you mean that, 'Absence makes the...~|~translationMissing
Actually forget it...~|~translationMissing
Hello again, remember me?~|~translationMissing
Of course, yes....how are.. you....ermmm...~|~translationMissing
You haven't got a clue who I am do you?~|~translationMissing
Not a clue my friend, but you seem to have a friendly face...a little blood stained, and perhaps in need of a wash, but friendly none the less.~|~translationMissing
You asked me to look for Juliet for you!~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, Juliet...my sweet darling...what news?~|~translationMissing
Nothing so far, but I need to ask a few questions?~|~translationMissing
If player has not started the Romeo & Juliet quest by talking to Romeo~|~translationMissing
Juliet~|~translationMissing
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Bold adventurer, have you seen Romeo on your travels? Skinny guy, a bit wishy washy, head full of poetry.~|~translationMissing
Yes I've met him.~|~translationMissing
Yes I've met him. He seemed a bit depressed.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that sounds like Romeo. I'd be very grateful if you could deliver a message to him?~|~translationMissing
Certainly, I'll do so straight away.~|~translationMissing
Many thanks! Oh, I'm so very grateful. You may be our only hope.~|~translationMissing
Player receives Message (Romeo & Juliet).~|~translationMissing
No, he was a little too weird for me.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, that will be the ruin of our love. Well, I will just stay here and worry. You unromantic soul.~|~translationMissing
No, I think I'd have remembered if I'd met him.~|~translationMissing
Oh, well that's a shame, I was hoping that you might deliver a message to him for me.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I don't even know what he looks like or where he is?~|~translationMissing
Oh, he's so lovely...in his own soppy and confused way. You should spot him easily! He's usually fending off the advances of the Varrockian market women. Are you sure I couldn't persuade you to deliver my itsy bitsty~|~translationMissing
widdle message to my Romeo?~|~translationMissing
Certainly, I will do so straight away.~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, I have better things to do.~|~translationMissing
Then, I will not keep you from them. Goodbye.~|~translationMissing
I guess I could look for him for you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that would be so wonderful of you! I'd be most grateful if you could please deliver a message to him?~|~translationMissing
I think you could do better than Romeo!~|~translationMissing
He has his good points, he's not obsessed with fighting, magic and ranging at least.~|~translationMissing
If the player started Romeo & Juliet by talking to Romeo~|~translationMissing
Juliet, I come from Romeo. He begs me to tell you that he cares still.~|~translationMissing
Oh how my heart soars to hear this news! Please take this message to him with great haste.~|~translationMissing
Well, I hope it's good news...he was quite upset when I left him.~|~translationMissing
He's quite often upset...the poor sensitive soul. But I don't think he's going to take this news very well, however, all is not lost.~|~translationMissing
Everything is explained in the letter, would you be so kind and deliver it to him please?~|~translationMissing
Draul Leptoc~|~translationMissing
What are you doing here? Snooping around...~|~translationMissing
I've come to see Juliet on Romeo's behalf.~|~translationMissing
What...what...Romeo! Why that good for nothing swine...he's always trying to get the affections of my daughter..that soppy, half brained nincompoop won't ever have the heart of my daughter.~|~translationMissing
She deserves someone of character, wit and repose.~|~translationMissing
What's so wrong about Romeo?~|~translationMissing
Wrong! What's wrong with him...have you actually talked to him? He's nothing but a dim witted upperclass twit, totally useless.~|~translationMissing
If he threw a stone at the ground, he'd probably miss! He's totally invisible when it's raining because he's so wet!~|~translationMissing
If you started with what's right with him, you'd have much less to consider!~|~translationMissing
Well, I admit, he's probably not the sharpest knife in the cutlery draw...~|~translationMissing
Sharp? I've seen keener wit in root vegetables. Anyway, stop changing the subject. Get out of here and don't think you can sneak up those stairs to see Juliet, because I'll catch you and then you'll be for it!~|~translationMissing
That seems a bit harsh....~|~translationMissing
Harsh but fair I think you'll find...now get OUT!~|~translationMissing
I've just come to have a chat with Juliet.~|~translationMissing
What on earth about? I hope you're not in cahoots with that good for nothing Romeo!~|~translationMissing
Err..no of course not....why would I be?~|~translationMissing
He's been trying to wooo my daughter for an age. Up until now she's had the good sense to just ignore him. I just don't know what's gotten into her recently so that she would give him the time of day.~|~translationMissing
Well, love is mysterious! Perhaps one day someone may even learn to love you!~|~translationMissing
What! Someone may fall in love with me...what are you trying to insinuate?~|~translationMissing
Err...Nothing....I guess I'd better be going now...~|~translationMissing
Oh...just looking around...~|~translationMissing
Just looking around! This is MY house! You might have at least 'ASKED' to view my considerably well appointed abode...but no, you've just burst in with all the elegance of a Troll at a tea party.~|~translationMissing
I can see that you're busy ranting so I'll just nip off and investigate a bit.~|~translationMissing
Hello~|~translationMissing
Phillipa~|~translationMissing
Hi, I'm Phillipa! Juliet's cousin? I like to keep an eye on her, make sure that dashing young Romeo doesn't just steal away from here under our plain old noses!~|~translationMissing
He'd do it you know... he's ever so dashing, and cavalier, in a wet blanket sort of way.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have Juliet's message in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Romeo...great news...I've been in touch with Juliet!~|~translationMissing
Oh great! That is great news! Well done...well done... what a total success!~|~translationMissing
Yes, and she gave me a message to give you...~|~translationMissing
Ohhh great! A message....wow!~|~translationMissing
A message...oh, I can't wait to read what my dear Juliet has to say....~|~translationMissing
I know...it's exciting isn't it...?~|~translationMissing
Yes...yes...~|~translationMissing
You've lost the message haven't you?~|~translationMissing
Yep, haven't got a clue where it is.~|~translationMissing
If the player has Juliet's message in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Romeo...great news...I've been in touch with Juliet! She's written a message for you...~|~translationMissing
You hand over Juliet's message to Romeo.~|~translationMissing
Oh, a message! A message! I've never had a message before...~|~translationMissing
No, no, not one!~|~translationMissing
Oh, well, except for the occasional court summons.~|~translationMissing
But they're not really 'nice' messages. Not like this one! I'm sure that this message will be lovely.~|~translationMissing
Well are you going to open it or not?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, yes, of course! 'Dearest Romeo, I am very pleased that you sent [player name] to look for me and to tell me that you still hold affliction...', Affliction! She thinks I'm diseased?~|~translationMissing
'Affection?'~|~translationMissing
Ahh yes...'still hold affection for me. I still feel great affection for you, but unfortunately my Father opposes our marriage.'~|~translationMissing
Oh dear...that doesn't sound too good.~|~translationMissing
What? '...great affection for you. Father opposes our..~|~translationMissing
'...marriage and will...~|~translationMissing
...will kill you if he sees you again!'~|~translationMissing
I have to be honest, it's not getting any better...~|~translationMissing
'Our only hope is that Father Lawrence, our long time confidant, can help us in some way.'~|~translationMissing
Well, that's it then...we haven't got a chance...~|~translationMissing
What about Father Lawrence?~|~translationMissing
...our love is over...the great romance, the life of my love...~|~translationMissing
...or you could speak to Father Lawrence!~|~translationMissing
Oh, my aching, breaking, heart...how useless the situation is now...we have no one to turn to...~|~translationMissing
FATHER LAWRENCE!~|~translationMissing
Father Lawrence?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, Father Lawrence...he's our long time confidant, he might have a solution! Yes, yes, you have to go and talk to Lather Fawrence for us and ask him if he's got any suggestions for our predicament?~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Father Lawrence?~|~translationMissing
Lather Fawrence! Oh he's...~|~translationMissing
You know he's not my 'real' Father don't you?~|~translationMissing
I think I suspected that he wasn't.~|~translationMissing
Well anyway...he tells these song, loring bermons...and keeps these here Carrockian vitizens snoring in his church to the East North.~|~translationMissing
Not so good my friend...I miss Judi..., Junie..., Joopie...~|~translationMissing
Juliet?~|~translationMissing
Juliet! I miss Juliet, terribly!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, so I see!~|~translationMissing
Have you heard anything from Juliet?~|~translationMissing
Sadly not my friend! And what's worse, her Father has threatened to kill me if he sees me. I mean, that seems a bit harsh!~|~translationMissing
Well, I shouldn't worry too much...you can always run away if you see him...~|~translationMissing
I just wish I could remember what he looks like! I live in fear of every man I see!~|~translationMissing
Hey again Romeo!~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello... Juliet has told me what you're doing for her and Romeo and I have to say, I'm very grateful to you. Juliet deserves a bit of happiness in her life.~|~translationMissing
And I'm sure Romeo is just the sort of jester to make her laugh out loud...hysterically you might say. He always brings a tear to my eyes...tears of happiness at his foolish antics!~|~translationMissing
Oh, thanks...I like to do my cupid bit.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing in my house? Up to no good I shouldn't wonder!~|~translationMissing
Just a small chore for Juliet, you do have a lovely daughter in her sir.~|~translationMissing
Oh...why, thank you...I've always tried to my best...~|~translationMissing
...Hang on! Enough of that smiley talk. I have a daughter and I know what she's like. Don't even think of carrying on anything behind my back, I have the eyes of a hawk, nothing gets past me!~|~translationMissing
Sir Draul notices the message!~|~translationMissing
Hey! What's that in your hands...looks like a message to me...with Juliet's barely legible scrawl on it...~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, that's probably why I can't read it!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I mean, that's right sir. I'm just popping to the shops to get some groceries for Juliet.~|~translationMissing
Right, have to be off now...thanks...~|~translationMissing
Groceries!~|~translationMissing
Groceries!...at a time like this, does that girl know what she's putting me through!~|~translationMissing
If the player has delivered Juliet's message to Romeo~|~translationMissing
Do you live here? If so, how's about a couple of hundred gold towards the rent eh? Pay your share I say...you don't want to be like that freeloading Romeo!~|~translationMissing
Father Lawrence~|~translationMissing
...and let Saradomin light the way for you...  Urgh!~|~translationMissing
Can't you see that I'm in the middle of a Sermon?!~|~translationMissing
But Romeo sent me!~|~translationMissing
But I'm busy delivering a sermon to my congregation!~|~translationMissing
Congregation~|~translationMissing
Zzzzzzzzz~|~translationMissing
Yes, well, it certainly seems like you have a captive audience!~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok...what do you want so I can get rid of you and continue with my sermon?~|~translationMissing
Romeo sent me. He says you may be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Ah Romeo, yes. A fine lad, but a little bit confused.~|~translationMissing
Yes, very confused....Anyway, Romeo wishes to be married to Juliet! She must be rescued from her father's control!~|~translationMissing
I agree, and I think I have an idea! A potion to make her appear dead...~|~translationMissing
Dead! Sounds a bit creepy to me...but please, continue.~|~translationMissing
The potion will only make Juliet 'appear' dead...then she'll be taken to the crypt...~|~translationMissing
Crypt! Again...very creepy! You must have some strange hobbies.~|~translationMissing
Then Romeo can collect her from the crypt! Go to the Apothecary, tell him I sent you and that you'll need a 'Cadava' potion.~|~translationMissing
Apart from the strong overtones of death, this is turning out to be a real love story.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not made a cadava potion~|~translationMissing
Ah, have you found the Apothecary yet? Remember, Cadava potion, for Juliet.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Romeo!~|~translationMissing
Ooh did you manage to survive one of Lather Fawrences sermons? I bet not, you were ages! I bet you snoozed on the welcome mat just as soon as you heard his voice!~|~translationMissing
Did not!~|~translationMissing
Oh, come on, come on, what did he say?~|~translationMissing
He wants me to go to the Apothecary!~|~translationMissing
The Apothecary?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I think so...but the word potion-ey doesn't exist.~|~translationMissing
Well, you just used it...so I guess it does exist!~|~translationMissing
It doesn't matter...do you know where the Apothecary is?~|~translationMissing
Why should I tell you?~|~translationMissing
Because I'm doing you a favour!~|~translationMissing
Right, yes...of course! Well, I think the potion-ey place is Wouth Sest of here and near a sword shop.~|~translationMissing
He seems keen for you to marry Juliet.~|~translationMissing
He seems very keen for you to marry Juliet.~|~translationMissing
Me too! I can't wait! Do you think it will be soon?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, but I'll do what I can. It just seems a bit odd that Father Lawrence is so keen for you to marry?~|~translationMissing
I can't imagine why he's so keen? Though, he was our messenger before you. Of course, he had a lot more hair back then...and I think we may have gone to school together...~|~translationMissing
What, since you were kids?~|~translationMissing
Yeah! Thinking about it now, we called him 'Diddy Dorrence' back then!~|~translationMissing
So, maybe, he just wants a bit of peace? And when you two are married, he won't have to traipse around delivering your messages anymore?~|~translationMissing
Yes, the years haven't been good to him.~|~translationMissing
Talk about Romeo & Juliet.~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't talked to the Apothecary before~|~translationMissing
Apothecary, Father Lawrence sent me. I need a Cadava potion to help Romeo and Juliet.~|~translationMissing
Cadava potion. It's pretty nasty. And hard to make.~|~translationMissing
Wing of rat, tail of frog. Ear of snake and horn of dog.~|~translationMissing
I have all that, but I need some Cadava berries.~|~translationMissing
You will have to find them while I get the rest ready. Bring them here when you have them. But be careful. They are nasty.~|~translationMissing
If the player has cadava berries in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Conveniently, I have some here.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the berries, which the Apothecary shakes up in a vial of strange liquid.~|~translationMissing
Phew! Here is what you need.~|~translationMissing
The Apothecary gives you a Cadava potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have cadava berries in their inventory~|~translationMissing
What do these berries look like?~|~translationMissing
They're a nice bright pink colour, with green leaves, stalks are a pale brown colour...you can't miss them. They look pretty tasty, but I wouldn't advise eating them.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get these berries?~|~translationMissing
I think I saw some recently in the local vicinity. Oh yes, that's right! There was a little bit of commotion when some kids visited the south eastern Varrock mining pit. The trip was disrupted because some kids~|~translationMissing
had found some cadavaberry bushes and they started picking them. They wrapped that trip up pretty quickly!~|~translationMissing
How are these berries dangerous?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, they're generally okay, but if handled improperly they can be a bit nasty. And I certainly wouldn't advise drinking the potion!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have cadava berries or cadava potion in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Keep searching for those Cadavaberries. They're needed for the potion.~|~translationMissing
If the player only has cadava berries in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Well done. You have the berries.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the cadava potion in their inventory or bank~|~translationMissing
Thank you for the Cadava potion.~|~translationMissing
You're welcome. I hope it helps that young couple find happiness.~|~translationMissing
If the player has given the cadava potion to Juliet~|~translationMissing
I gave Juliet the Cadava potion.~|~translationMissing
Good, good. I hope it helps that young couple find happiness.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you know a potion to make hair fall out?~|~translationMissing
Did you find the Apothecary?~|~translationMissing
I've got the cadava potion.~|~translationMissing
Good! Good work! Ok, take it to Juliet, she's expecting you. I'll talk to Romeo and make sure he knows what to do.~|~translationMissing
If player is not carrying a cadava potion~|~translationMissing
Hi Romeo!~|~translationMissing
Oh hello, have you seen Lather Fawrence?~|~translationMissing
Yes, he's given me details of a potion which should help resolve this situation. The Apothecary is helping me prepare it.~|~translationMissing
Ooooh, it all sounds horribly complicated?~|~translationMissing
All I can say is I'll be glad when Juliet's finally in that crypt!~|~translationMissing
Spoken like a true lover!~|~translationMissing
If player is carrying a cadava potion~|~translationMissing
Romeo spots the Cadava potion.~|~translationMissing
Ooohh, that's the potion is it? Rather you than me!~|~translationMissing
I'm not drinking it! It's for Juliet!~|~translationMissing
Well, I mean...it's probably delicious...and not dangerous at all. And you quite often see harmless drinks in a glowing sort of pink colour.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I'm not convinced...maybe you ought to try some before I give it to Juliet?~|~translationMissing
Urgh! No way! Not in a million years!~|~translationMissing
Ok...but you know what to do when I've given this to Juliet?~|~translationMissing
Oh, yeah...sure Lather Fawrence explained all that to me...~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a Cadava potion in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Hi Juliet!~|~translationMissing
Hi [player name], how close am I to being with my true love Romeo?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I still have to get a special potion for you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I hope it isn't a love potion because you would be wasting your time. My love for Romeo grows stronger every minute...~|~translationMissing
That must be because you're not with him...~|~translationMissing
Oh no! I long to be close to my true love Romeo!~|~translationMissing
Well, ok then...I'll set about getting this potion as quickly as I can!~|~translationMissing
Fair luck to you, the end is close.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Cadava potion in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Hi Juliet! I have an interesting proposition for you...suggested by Father Lawrence. It may be the only way you'll be able to escape from this house and be with Romeo.~|~translationMissing
Go on....~|~translationMissing
I have a Cadava potion here, suggested by Father Lawrence. If you drink it, it will make you appear dead!~|~translationMissing
Yes...~|~translationMissing
And when you appear dead...your still and lifeless corpse will be removed to the crypt!~|~translationMissing
Oooooh, a cold dark creepy crypt...~|~translationMissing
...sounds just peachy!~|~translationMissing
Then...Romeo can steal into the crypt and rescue you just as you wake up!~|~translationMissing
...and this is the great idea for getting me out of here?~|~translationMissing
To be fair, I can't take all the credit...in fact...it was all Father Lawrence's suggestion...~|~translationMissing
Ok...if this is the best we can do...hand over the potion!~|~translationMissing
You pass the suspicious potion to Juliet.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! I just hope Romeo can remember to get me from the crypt.~|~translationMissing
Please go to Romeo and make sure he understands. Although I love his gormless, lovelorn soppy ways, he can be a bit dense sometimes and I don't want to wake up in that crypt on my own.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene starts~|~translationMissing
Oh, here's Phillipa, my cousin...she's in on the plot too!~|~translationMissing
She's going to make it seem even more convincing!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm quite the actress! Good luck dear cousin!~|~translationMissing
Right...bottoms up!~|~translationMissing
Urk!~|~translationMissing
Oh no...Juliet has...died!~|~translationMissing
You might be more believable if you're not smiling when you say it...~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah...you might be right...ok, let's try again.~|~translationMissing
Oh no...Juliet has...died?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps a bit louder, like you're upset...that your cousin has died!~|~translationMissing
Right...yes...Ok, ok, I think I'm getting my motivation now. Ok, let's try this again!~|~translationMissing
OH NO...JULIET HAS...DIED?.... Oooooohhhhhh....(sob), (sob).Juliet...my poor dead cousin!~|~translationMissing
What's all that screaming?~|~translationMissing
Oh no! My poor daughter...what has become of you?~|~translationMissing
Poor Juliet...make preparations for her body to be placed in the Crypt...~|~translationMissing
A cutscene ends~|~translationMissing
Hey ,[sic] what are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Nothing much sir...I promise...I'm just an innocent friend of Juliet's...doing her a few favours...as a friend.~|~translationMissing
Well, just make sure there's no funny business going on that's all I can say. Do you know why?~|~translationMissing
I think I can guess sir...~|~translationMissing
There's no need to guess! You can see it in my hawk like eyes, in my cat like ears and my dog like nose...~|~translationMissing
Are you saying that you look like an animal sir?~|~translationMissing
NO! Not look like an animal! I have the keen 'SENSES' of an animal and I don't miss a thing. Don't even think about trying anything!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the cadava potion~|~translationMissing
If the player currently has the cadava potion~|~translationMissing
Draul notices the potion!~|~translationMissing
Hey! What's that in your hands? Looks like some sort of potion to me!~|~translationMissing
Err...no! Nope! Not a potion! Some medicine...I have a terrible cough ...cough...cough....see?~|~translationMissing
Except, I can't drink too much or else it makes me feel 'really' tired. One sip of this and the lights go out...I mean, I'm asleep in a minute.~|~translationMissing
Sleep!~|~translationMissing
Sleep...! How can you even think of such a thing at a time like this? And I hope you have no intentions of sleeping in my house!~|~translationMissing
You'll get a bill for rent if I catch you dozing off around here!~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello again! How was I...do you think I was convincing?~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes, totally!~|~translationMissing
Ohhh good! I do hope Juliet will be pleased as well! That dashing young Romeo must be beside himself with excitement! Have you told him the good news yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but soon!~|~translationMissing
Good, good...you lucky thing, I can't wait to see the look on his face!~|~translationMissing
My poor Juliet....she's dead...dead! I shouldn't have been so hard on her...she was my lovely daughter. Booo hoooo hooooo!~|~translationMissing
Romeo, it's all set. Juliet has drunk the potion and has been taken down into the Crypt...now you just need to pop along and collect her.~|~translationMissing
Ah right, the potion! Great...~|~translationMissing
What potion would that be then?~|~translationMissing
The Cadava potion...you know, the one which will make her appear dead! She's in the crypt, pop along and claim your true love.~|~translationMissing
But I'm scared...will you come with me?~|~translationMissing
Oh , ok...come on! I think I saw the entrance when I visited there last...~|~translationMissing
This is pretty scary...~|~translationMissing
Oh , be quiet...~|~translationMissing
We're here. Look, Juliet is over there!~|~translationMissing
You go over to her...and I'll go and wait over here...~|~translationMissing
Ohhh, ok then...~|~translationMissing
Hey...Juliet...~|~translationMissing
Juliet....?~|~translationMissing
Oh dear...you seem to be dead.~|~translationMissing
Hi Romeo...I'm Phillipa!~|~translationMissing
Wow! You're a fox!~|~translationMissing
It's a shame about Juliet...but perhaps we can meet up later?~|~translationMissing
Who's Juliet?~|~translationMissing

5.2 Speaking to Islwyn~|~translationMissing
Islwyn~|~translationMissing
You, you're the human that killed Tyras. Arianwyn told us about you.~|~translationMissing
That's me. Could you take me to Arianwyn?~|~translationMissing
Why should we? All you human do is take and destroy with no care for others. We don't need your help. You've done enough damage.~|~translationMissing
Well I admit that I've made a few mistakes, but my intentions were good, I swear.~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but it's not a risk worth taking. It was the acts of humans that led my grantmother's death. You will bring similar ruin to us.~|~translationMissing
Your grandmother?~|~translationMissing
Glarial, wife to King Baxtorian. At one time my grandparents ruled over a great elven kingdom. But your kind put an end to that.~|~translationMissing
Glarial? I know that name, I visited her tomb. I moved her remians to Baxtorian Falls, I thought that was where she would want to be.~|~translationMissing
You... you moved her into the waterfall? That... that's the perfect place for her to be.~|~translationMissing
Maybe this human isn't as bad as you think Islwyn~|~translationMissing
Maybe... Very well human, we will take you to Arianwyn. But first, there is something you must do. If my grandmother has been moved, then her new tomb must be consecrated. Do this, and you will earn my trust.~|~translationMissing
Start the Roving Elves quest?~|~translationMissing
Deal, what do I need to do?~|~translationMissing
I don't know the consecration process myself. You should speak to Eluned. She is wise in the ways of the ritual.~|~translationMissing
I'd rather not.~|~translationMissing
If you wish to see Arianwyn, this is the only way. Come find us if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
So what do you need to do?~|~translationMissing
Hey there, Islwyn said you might be able to help me. He told me you'd know how to consecrate ground for an elven burrial. I need to consecrate Glarial's new resting place.~|~translationMissing
That I do... It is also elvish tradition to plant a specially enchanted crystal seed at the graves of our ancestors. The seed will create guardians to protect the area. Unfortunately the crystal seed must be tuned to the person it's protecting... a new seed won't do. But you should be able to recover the seed from her old tomb. I'm not very familiar with the lands to the east so I couldn't tell you where her old tomb is I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
That's okay, I've been there before. It's just south east of Baxtorian Falls.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Now, the tomb's guardians will be protecting the seed, you'll need to defeat one of them to get it. Once you have it, return to me and I will re-enchant it.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back as soon as I have it.~|~translationMissing
Hello, any luck finding the consecration seed?~|~translationMissing
No not yet.~|~translationMissing
You should be able to find it in her old resting place, I think you said it was south east of Baxtorian Falls. You'll need to defeat one of the old tomb's guardians to obtain it. Bring it to me as soon as you find it, then I can re-enchant it.~|~translationMissing
Good day. Have you spoken to Eluned yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, she told me to retrieve a crystal seed from Glarial's old tomb.~|~translationMissing
Well I wish I could help but my kind have no place in the east any more.~|~translationMissing
Yes, she told me to retrieve a crystal seed from Glarial's old tomb. I have it right here.~|~translationMissing
Good, you should go and show it to her.~|~translationMissing
Yes I have it here.~|~translationMissing
You hand the crystal seed to Eluned.~|~translationMissing
How odd. I can see her lips moving... But there's no sound.~|~translationMissing
Eluned hands you an enchanted crystal seed.~|~translationMissing
Plant this seed in Glarial's new tomb, close to her remains. With it in place, she will rest in peace.~|~translationMissing
Hey, How's it going? Have you managed to reconsecrate Glarial's resting place?~|~translationMissing
Well when you're ready, plant the seed in Glarial's new tomb, close to her remains. With it in place, she will rest in peace.~|~translationMissing
Good day. I hear you managed to retrieve the crystal seed.~|~translationMissing
Indeed I did, all I need to do now is plant it in her new resting place.~|~translationMissing
This is good to hear. It put me at ease to know she is in my grandfather's home. I will rest even easier once it has been consecrated.~|~translationMissing
This seed may only be planted close to Glarial's remians.~|~translationMissing
You dig a small hole with your spade.~|~translationMissing
You drop the crystal seed in the hole.~|~translationMissing
Well done. You should let Islwyn know.~|~translationMissing
Hello Islwyn..~|~translationMissing
You have returned! Is it done?~|~translationMissing
It is, your grandmother's resting place has been consecrated.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, I admit I was wrong about you. You have showed care and compassion that I didn't think possible for a human. As promised, we will take you to Arianwyn. But first, a reward for you.~|~translationMissing
Islwyn shows you a crystal bow and a crystal shield.~|~translationMissing
We elves use equipment formed out of crystal itself, far superior to your human weapons. However, the crystal does degrade with use and will eventually revert to seed. Both the shield and bow I am carrying have been used, so are not at their full potential. They should still be quite useful though.~|~translationMissing
Fascinating. What do you mean by 'revert to seed'?~|~translationMissing
All elven crystal starts as a seed. It can then be sung into various shapes through the power of the voice. Eventually, it reverts back to seed, ready for the next song. Keep an eye out for an elf named Ilfeen as you wander the forest. She can chant crystal seeds into new items for you.~|~translationMissing
I will, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'm sure you will learn more about crystal seeds as you spend time with our kind. For now though, which one of these creations would you like?~|~translationMissing
Shields are for wimps! Give me the bow!~|~translationMissing
All right. If you ever need a replacement I can sell you another. Remember, the better the condition of crystal equipment, the more potential it has.~|~translationMissing
I don't like running and hiding behind mushrooms. Shield please!~|~translationMissing
I need some time to decide.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Come find me when you are ready.~|~translationMissing
Hi, I hear you finished consecrating Glarial's tomb. Well done.~|~translationMissing
It was a worthy deed.~|~translationMissing
Indeed it was. Anyway, are you ready to be taken to Arianwyn?~|~translationMissing
Continues with Mourning's End Part I dialogue.~|~translationMissing
Hello again~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Are you ready to be taken to Arianwyn?~|~translationMissing
Very well. Arianwyn will be in Lletya, Eluned can take you there.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I wanted to talk about crystal equipment.~|~translationMissing
As you wish~|~translationMissing
I'd like to buy a bow~|~translationMissing
Well sorry, but you'll have to get 900,000 coins. Oh well... See you later.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to buy a shield~|~translationMissing
Well sorry, but you'll have to get 750,000 coins. Oh well... See you later.~|~translationMissing
What should I do with crystal seeds?~|~translationMissing
Ilfeen can chant them into new items for you. She'll be wandering the forest somewhere.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep an eye out for her, thanks.~|~translationMissing
No problem. Let us know when you are ready to be taken to Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't want anything.~|~translationMissing

Has anything been happening in the kingdom recently?~|~translationMissing
Interesting that you should ask that, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
You see, the people are worried that war will break out again.~|~translationMissing
King Vargas has found himself with little to do now that you are the regent. He intended, at first, to return to adventuring.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, we still have not had the doors to the throne room enlarged so that he can leave...~|~translationMissing
So, what has he been doing?~|~translationMissing
He has been trying to rule once more, in your absence. However, he has once again quarrelled with the Queen of Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
The two of them have been writing letters to each other, threatening to raise armies and declare war on each other once more!~|~translationMissing
Your Royal Highness, I suggest that you deal with this matter and reconcile the two of them again. Such a quarrel is not good for Miscellania.~|~translationMissing
Start the Royal Trouble quest?~|~translationMissing
Very well, I'll sort it out.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
I suggest you talk to the prince and princess to find out more about the situation.~|~translationMissing
Prince Brand has been asking after you. He would very much like to see you once again.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have the time at the moment.~|~translationMissing
You are the regent of this kingdom, Your Royal Highness. I would urge you to reconsider.~|~translationMissing
However, you are also a busy hero, and thus I understand your reluctance.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, [Fremennik name], but I'm very busy. Talk to my son and daughter if Ghrim can't help you.~|~translationMissing
Talking to the Prince and Princess, Your Royal Highness. I believe they have something to ask you.~|~translationMissing
Hello, dear.~|~translationMissing
Prince Brand~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, dear!~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I haven't managed to find a priest for our marriage yet.~|~translationMissing
That's a pity.~|~translationMissing
Oh, Advisor Ghrim said I should talk to you and the Princess about recent events in the kingdom.~|~translationMissing
I'll ask Father if he minds us discussing this in the throne room for a while.~|~translationMissing
Advisor Ghrim told me to talk to you about the situation in Miscellania.~|~translationMissing
What has happened while I've been away?~|~translationMissing
It's terrible, my dear! My father's been arguing with the Queen of Etceteria, and has managed to start a war again.~|~translationMissing
It's awful that your work has been undone by such an accident.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean, 'an accident'?~|~translationMissing
Well, if my father had had something to occupy him, he wouldn't have gotten bored and decided to argue with Queen Sigrid again.~|~translationMissing
What would you suggest he do, then?~|~translationMissing
Princess Astrid~|~translationMissing
We can't have him declaring war all the time. Even if it would give us a chance to show off our military might.~|~translationMissing
And I could finally show him that archery isn't a cowardly skill. If only we had an army, we could prove ourselves against the Etceterians.~|~translationMissing
Astrid, I have an even better idea.~|~translationMissing
Better than archery? What is it?~|~translationMissing
I think we should persuade our father and Queen Sigrid to marry!~|~translationMissing
...What are you talking about, Brand?~|~translationMissing
Think of the poetic irony of the situation!~|~translationMissing
The best part is that I could write their wedding hymn for them.~|~translationMissing
'Today is a happy day, we are getting married,~|~translationMissing
Our national anthems are wonderful, won't you sing this song?'~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure that's such a good idea...~|~translationMissing
I think it will work.~|~translationMissing
I quite agree!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps it's an odd idea, my dear, but since we don't have an army, we can hardly declare war...~|~translationMissing
Are you sure it'll work?~|~translationMissing
Of course it will! It always happens in the ballads and stories.~|~translationMissing
Two people who start out hating each other, and end up falling in love. It's a classic tale.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't always work...~|~translationMissing
But we don't have an army, so it's our best hope.~|~translationMissing
So, will you talk to our father and Queen Sigrid, then?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you can manage to arrange it all.~|~translationMissing
I'll give it a try. But they'll still be angry with each other, so I don't think it'll work.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you'll manage to do it, dear.~|~translationMissing
What is it? You'll have to excuse me, I'm quite busy...~|~translationMissing
What are you busy with, your Majesty?~|~translationMissing
Affairs of state, and so on.~|~translationMissing
I thought I was supposed to deal with those, once you appointed me Regent.~|~translationMissing
Well, there's not all that much for me to do these days, you see.~|~translationMissing
And though you do make a fine regent, you cannot be here all the time.~|~translationMissing
So you're still helping to rule, your Majesty?~|~translationMissing
In a manner of speaking.~|~translationMissing
These 'affairs of state' you're dealing with...~|~translationMissing
Would these involve starting a war with Queen Sigrid of Etceteria?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly...~|~translationMissing
Well, yes. Of course, Sigrid was the one who insulted me first.~|~translationMissing
And that's the least of the kingdom's problems at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Some of Frodi's barrels are missing, as are many of Magnus's crates. Leif also says he's had stacks of wood disappear.~|~translationMissing
Since you're the regent, you should investigate what has happened to these missing resources.~|~translationMissing
Right away, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Right away, your majesty.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I have some other things to do.~|~translationMissing
That never prevented me from ruling this kingdom when I was your age, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose I could spare a little time.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad to have your help.~|~translationMissing
All you need to do for the moment is to talk to the citizens of Miscellania, and find out what has been happening.~|~translationMissing
It might also be useful to interrogate the citizens of Etceteria to see what they know.~|~translationMissing
Gardener Gunnhild~|~translationMissing
Good day, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
King Vargas tells me that things have been going missing from the kingdom. Can you tell me anything about this?~|~translationMissing
You mean you hadn't heard, Your Royal Highness? Etceterian soldiers came and demanded tithes from us.~|~translationMissing
You're the only person we give any of our goods to, so we refused, and found the next day that some of our goods had been stolen.~|~translationMissing
Lumberjack Leif~|~translationMissing
You hadn't heard about it, Your Royal Highness? Etceterian soldiers came and demanded tithes from us.~|~translationMissing
Miner Magnus~|~translationMissing
You mean you don't know, Your Royal Highness? Etceterian soldiers came and demanded tithes from us.~|~translationMissing
Have you spoken to the citizens yet, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
I've spoken to the Miscellanean citizens.~|~translationMissing
They say that the Etceterian army demanded tithes from them, and took some of their goods even though they refused.~|~translationMissing
So, Sigrid's planning to invade, is she?~|~translationMissing
Or perhaps she's claiming that Miscellania is part of Etceteria now!~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name], go and talk to Sigrid and ask her what she thinks she's doing.~|~translationMissing
Exchanging angry letters is understandable, but where did she get an army from?~|~translationMissing
I'll talk to her right away, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Your Majesty, do you have a moment?~|~translationMissing
Queen Sigrid~|~translationMissing
Incompetent! I'll give him 'incompetent'...~|~translationMissing
Yes, what is it?~|~translationMissing
I hear from King Vargas that relations between Etceteria and Miscellania are none too cordial at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Of course not!~|~translationMissing
That idiot Vargas has decided to take a hand in ruling Miscellania, even though he'd handed it over to you, and now he's declared war on Etceteria again!~|~translationMissing
I suppose all those insults I made about his parentage can't have helped the matter...~|~translationMissing
Even so, that doesn't excuse what he did to my citizens!~|~translationMissing
What happened, your Majesty?~|~translationMissing
My citizens have told me that items of theirs have been taken, and I'm sure that Vargas is behind it.~|~translationMissing
Since you're the one who's supposed to be ruling Miscellania, you should sort it out.~|~translationMissing
Of course, it's my duty.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you understand.~|~translationMissing
If you talk to the citizens of Etceteria, they will tell you exactly what happened.~|~translationMissing
I would find out for myself, but the pressures of ruling are immense, and I would never have the time free.~|~translationMissing
Of course not, it's not my fault.~|~translationMissing
What sort of Regent of Miscellania do you call yourself?~|~translationMissing
Of course it's your fault. You rule the country now.~|~translationMissing
I suppose you're right...~|~translationMissing
Matilda~|~translationMissing
Queen Sigrid tells me that things have been going missing from the kingdom. Can you tell me anything about this?~|~translationMissing
You haven't heard about that until now?~|~translationMissing
I'm surprised.~|~translationMissing
Well, Miscellanian soldiers came and asked for tribute.~|~translationMissing
When I told them to leave, they came back the next day and stole my hat!~|~translationMissing
It was a wonderful hat. Mithril-reinforced, you see, and with a special splitbark brim to keep the sun off.~|~translationMissing
Could you please get it back for me?~|~translationMissing
Have you talked to the citizens yet, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
I've talked to the Miscellanian citizens as well as the Etceterians.~|~translationMissing
What exactly happened?~|~translationMissing
The Etceterian citizens said that Miscellanian soldiers came to their houses and demanded tribute...~|~translationMissing
Just as I suspected! Vargas, you treacherous snake!~|~translationMissing
...and the Miscellanian citizens said that the Etceterian army marched into their fields and demanded tithes!~|~translationMissing
Your Majest-~|~translationMissing
Etceterian army? There hasn't been one for centuries! These Miscellanian soldiers of his must have disguised themselves.~|~translationMissing
If I may-~|~translationMissing
And since Vargas shouldn't even be ruling now, it's your responsibility to deal with this.~|~translationMissing
The one who should sort this out is you.~|~translationMissing
I suppose so...~|~translationMissing
I suppose you're right.~|~translationMissing
It's one of the hazards of ruling a country, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Have you found those stolen items yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
You'd better hurry and look for them.~|~translationMissing
We don't know what Vargas might be planning next!~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure I should be reading this...~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't read other people's letters.~|~translationMissing
I won't read that letter. It's for the King, not for me.~|~translationMissing
Go ahead and read it anyway.~|~translationMissing
Oh, why not. I'm the Regent, after all.~|~translationMissing
How are your investigations going, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
I've found the people who took the goods from your citizens!~|~translationMissing
Those Etceterian soldiers?~|~translationMissing
They weren't Etceterian soldiers after all.~|~translationMissing
They were teenagers from Rellekka who were trying to prove themselves as adults, by starting a war and then bringing about peace.~|~translationMissing
Why didn't they just go through the trials as usual?~|~translationMissing
Unless they're the ones that the Council warned me about.~|~translationMissing
Still, I can't believe they'd start a war between Miscellania and Etceteria, just to show they were adults...~|~translationMissing
But at least you've found the missing goods. Do you have them with you?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, your Majesty. There were far too many for me to carry.~|~translationMissing
We'll have to send people down to collect them later, then.~|~translationMissing
And I also spoke to Queen Sigrid of Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
She gave me a letter for you, which she said was a formal apology.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Do you have this letter with you?~|~translationMissing
Of course, your Majesty. Here you are.~|~translationMissing
You defeated that sea snake? Sigrid seems rather impressed with that.~|~translationMissing
And the caverns underneath her palace are joined to ours, I see.~|~translationMissing
She thinks we should join forces to develop them for more houses.~|~translationMissing
Finally... hmm. That's not what I'd have expected from Sigrid.~|~translationMissing
What is it, your Majesty?~|~translationMissing
She, erm, says if I weren't a yeti, she might want to get to know me better.~|~translationMissing
Since we're both warmongering fools, she thinks we'd get on well.~|~translationMissing
I suppose she has a point there.~|~translationMissing
Brand's suggestion worked, and I didn't even do anything.~|~translationMissing
Nothing, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Do you want me to give a reply to Queen Sigrid?~|~translationMissing
No, no. I'll think about it for a while.~|~translationMissing
Though I'd like to tell her I'm sorry for calling her a warmongering harpy.~|~translationMissing
In the meantime, [Fremennik name], you have managed to avert a war and bring the culprits to light.~|~translationMissing
The kingdom of Miscellania will have to reward you for this.~|~translationMissing
I hear that the Etceterians are also grateful for your help, and have pledged some of their resources.~|~translationMissing
You can talk to Ghrim to deal with those, just as before.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for your work in bringing peace back to these islands, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
I hear that the Etceterians have also pledged to give you some of their resources, as thanks for preventing war once again.~|~translationMissing
How is the kingdom faring?~|~translationMissing
Everything is fine, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Remember, speak to Ghrim if you require assistance.~|~translationMissing
I hear you made peace between our kingdom and Etceteria once more. Well done, dear.~|~translationMissing
(Continues with relationship dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
I hear you made peace between our kingdom and Etceteria once more. Well done, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Thank you for all your help, [Fremennik name]. It's good to know that the Regent of Miscellania is willing to help his neighbours.~|~translationMissing
You're welcome, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing

Pirate Pete~|~translationMissing
Mornin'.~|~translationMissing
Hey...you're an adventurer, right?~|~translationMissing
Yes I am!~|~translationMissing
Got any quests for me?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact!~|~translationMissing
(Ahem.)~|~translationMissing
I am a poor, dispossessed nobleman, forced by circumstance to lurk in the middle of nowhere, soliciting help from passers-by.~|~translationMissing
You see, my fiendish half-brother has seized my estates and forced me into exile.~|~translationMissing
The simple lemon farmers suffer under his tyrannous yoke, and only a brave adventurer can lift his iron boot from the neck of the poor.~|~translationMissing
To reclaim my lands I will need to have my family sword returned to me so that I may present it as proof of my rulership.~|~translationMissing
Will you help me find my family sword?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Your uncorroborated sob story has touched my heart. When do we set off?~|~translationMissing
You'll help! Wonderful!~|~translationMissing
But, alas, my half brother has a powerful ally, the mighty demon...~|~translationMissing
Err...Barrelor!~|~translationMissing
Barrelor?~|~translationMissing
That's what I said!~|~translationMissing
Barrelor is an awesome opponent, and to reclaim my family sword you will need to defeat him, for he guards it within the deadly Trapped Pit of Barrelor.~|~translationMissing
Of course, I fear no demon!~|~translationMissing
Atta [boy/girl]!~|~translationMissing
When I am reinstated in my rightful place, I will not be a very wealthy man, as my half-brother has squandered my family fortune.~|~translationMissing
However, I will gladly give you every bent penny of what is left, and starve in the gutter with my many, many adorable children, if you say you will help me.~|~translationMissing
Nonsense! Keep the money!~|~translationMissing
Nonsense! Keep the money! I will dispose of this evil half-brother of yours and leave you what little money is left to feed your family.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Just pick up your diversion and we'll leave!~|~translationMissing
What diversion?~|~translationMissing
(Cutscene 1 begins.)~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll take the cash in used coins please.~|~translationMissing
Look, I think I'll wait here for someone a little more... you know...~|~translationMissing
...heroic.~|~translationMissing
Not a chance, this sounds too dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Captain Braindeath~|~translationMissing
Arrr... 'Tis lookin' bleak...~|~translationMissing
Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Good news Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
I found us a hero down by the docks!~|~translationMissing
Be they heroic, brave and true?~|~translationMissing
Aye! They also be gullible, tied up and unconscious!~|~translationMissing
They were willing to help out some random stranger with a good enough sob story, so I smacked them with a bottle and rowed them over.~|~translationMissing
Brilliant! The island's location will remain a secret!~|~translationMissing
Bring 'em here and wake 'em up.~|~translationMissing
We may make it through this yet...~|~translationMissing
(Cutscene ends and dialogue continues below.)~|~translationMissing
Are ye alright, [lad/lass]?~|~translationMissing
Ohhhh... My head...~|~translationMissing
It feels like someone has smacked me one with a bottle...~|~translationMissing
Arr... Those devils gave ye a nasty knock when ye came to aid us.~|~translationMissing
But now yer here we'll run those evil brain-eatin' dogs off the island fer good!~|~translationMissing
What? What is going on here?~|~translationMissing
I can't seem to remember anything beyond chatting to a man at the docks.~|~translationMissing
Arr. Well, [lad/lass], that would be Pete, one of my men.~|~translationMissing
He's been out lookin' fer heroes like yerself to aid us in our peril.~|~translationMissing
Okay... I'll buy that. It sounds like something I would do.~|~translationMissing
So where am I, and what is going on?~|~translationMissing
Yer on Braindeath Island!~|~translationMissing
Where it lies is a secret, because ye are standin' in the brewery of Cap'n Braindeath, purveyor of the most vitriolic alcoholic beverages in the world!~|~translationMissing
I am the notorious alchemist Cap'n Braindeath, and this whole operation be my idea!~|~translationMissing
With my crew of sturdy, upright pirate brewers, we sail the seven seas, distributing cheap 'alcohol' to all and sundry.~|~translationMissing
Oooh!~|~translationMissing
These be dark times, though, [lad/lass]. See, a week ago we awoke to find ourselves beseiged.~|~translationMissing
The lads and I have held them off so far, but 'tis only a matter of time before they sweep through the buildin' and put us all to the sword.~|~translationMissing
Them!~|~translationMissing
The captian points out of the window....~|~translationMissing
Cutscene ends~|~translationMissing
Are they...~|~translationMissing
...protesting?~|~translationMissing
Arr, [lad/lass]! That they are!~|~translationMissing
Day and night they seek to break our will with their chantin', and their singin' and their passive resistance!~|~translationMissing
So, what do you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
Well, me and the lads got our heads together and decided that if we can get their Cap'n drunk enough, perhaps they'll stop protestin'.~|~translationMissing
If that happens, we'll slip out the back and set up shop somewhere else.~|~translationMissing
Well, how can I help?~|~translationMissing
Well, first of all, we need someone to go out the front and grow us some Blindweed.~|~translationMissing
'Tis one of the ingredients of our 'rum'.~|~translationMissing
The only problem is that those rottin' fiends have torn up and destroyed all but one of the Blindweed Patches.~|~translationMissing
Here, [lad/lass]. I'll give ye the seed you'll need fer growin' the herb. Help yerself to the gardenin' equipment in the basement.~|~translationMissing
I'll warn ye again that those devils are sat right on top of the patch.~|~translationMissing
Try hecklin' 'em from a distance. Those Swabs may talk a good fight, but if ye can put a scare in 'em they'll keep out of yer way!~|~translationMissing
So...~|~translationMissing
What exactly do you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
Arr, well I want ye to get outside and grow some Blindweed.~|~translationMissing
Best be careful, [lad/lass], fer them pirates will skin ye alive if they catch ye.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the Blindweed seed~|~translationMissing
And what happens if I lose the seed?~|~translationMissing
Then I'll have ye flogged, hung, slapped with a haddock and sent back out there to fight the zombie hordes with little more than harsh language!~|~translationMissing
Arr... Here, [lad/lass]. Just take this and get goin'!~|~translationMissing
(The player is handed another seed.)~|~translationMissing
Why do you talk like a pirate?~|~translationMissing
Why do you talk like a pirate? Didn't you tell me you were an alchemist?~|~translationMissing
Arr, [lad/lass], 'tis true.~|~translationMissing
However, 'tis also true that I stumbled across the basic recipe fer my most potent of brews in a terrible alchemical accident.~|~translationMissing
See, 'twas a dark and stormy night, and the wind was howlin' around the trees as I worked late into the night.~|~translationMissing
Steppin' too close to a candle with my flask in my hand, I was suddenly swept up in a terrible, yet potently alcoholic, explosion.~|~translationMissing
Well' [lad/lass], it seems the fumes from that first batch of me 'rum' did strange things to me brain.~|~translationMissing
I don't remember the exact words the healers used, but apparently the stuff burned out the tiny, specialised part of me brain that tells me not to talk like a pirate.~|~translationMissing
That... that... that sounds utterly impossible!~|~translationMissing
Arr! That be what I told them!~|~translationMissing
So what do you make here anyway?~|~translationMissing
'Rum', [lad/lass]!~|~translationMissing
The finest, most potent, most flammable and most debilitatin' 'rum' in the whole of Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
Rum, eh?~|~translationMissing
No, [lad/lass], 'rum'!~|~translationMissing
What's the difference?~|~translationMissing
Well, see, it's like this.~|~translationMissing
If we called the stuff we make 'rum' without makin' the little quote gestures every time, then the Cookin' Guild has promised to do entertaininly painful things to us with whisks.~|~translationMissing
See, technically -~|~translationMissing
And by that I mean technically according to the Disposal of Hazardous Waste Act and the Health and Safety Laws -~|~translationMissing
technically, what we're brewin' here is Artificially Produced Hyper Condensed Sweetened 'Rum' Flavour Distillate.~|~translationMissing
Riiiiiiiight...~|~translationMissing
So ye see, [lad/lass], we just call it 'rum' because the real name be a bit of a mouthful.~|~translationMissing
Want a drop?~|~translationMissing
No thanks... I think I'll skip it for now.~|~translationMissing
So... how are you holding up?~|~translationMissing
Brewer~|~translationMissing
You sure?~|~translationMissing
Oh Guthix, who am I kidding?~|~translationMissing
We're all gonna die!~|~translationMissing
You're one of THEM, aren't you!~|~translationMissing
O...kay...walking away now, smiling and not making eye contact.~|~translationMissing
Game over, man! Game over!~|~translationMissing
Errr...keep up the good work.~|~translationMissing
How do I know you're not one of them?~|~translationMissing
Well, I don't know... the way I'm breathing could give it away.~|~translationMissing
That means nothing! NOTHING!~|~translationMissing
Don't talk to me! If I play this right, I can sell you lot out and make it to the mainland!~|~translationMissing
No school today mother, my brain hurts real baaaad...~|~translationMissing
I no sleep in many, many, many days.~|~translationMissing
Don't sneak up on me like that!~|~translationMissing
Don't you know there's a war on?~|~translationMissing
I didnt think this counted as a war.~|~translationMissing
That's because you're a landlubber!~|~translationMissing
I bet ye've never had to beat a dozen zombies to death with a blunt toothpick!~|~translationMissing
That's right. Have you?~|~translationMissing
No, I've spent most of my time in the toilet to be honest.~|~translationMissing
Very well, considering.~|~translationMissing
Considering what?~|~translationMissing
That I've been crawling into the corner to cry whenever nobody is looking.~|~translationMissing
Wow... I always thought pirates were tough...~|~translationMissing
'Ello guv.~|~translationMissing
Why are you not helping out the others?~|~translationMissing
Well you see, guv, I've got these unshakable religious convictions.~|~translationMissing
And those are?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's like this, see. I used to do a bit of the old priestin' on the side.~|~translationMissing
You know, collectin' for repairs to the church roof, passing the collection plate, jumble sales, nicking the lead off the temple roof so they needed repairing again.~|~translationMissing
Real holy stuff, you know.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound all that holy to me.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's because you're not a man of the cloth are you?~|~translationMissing
You are, in fact, what we refer to in layman's terms as a punter.~|~translationMissing
But anyway, all that priestin' left me with an unshakable faith in three things.~|~translationMissing
The power of good over evil.~|~translationMissing
The true glory of the human spirit.~|~translationMissing
And that I ain't goin out there with those things runnin' around.~|~translationMissing
There is a tangle of rusty old farming equipment in here.~|~translationMissing
What would you like to take?~|~translationMissing
A rake~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a rake~|~translationMissing
You can't find another rake. Good job you already have one.~|~translationMissing
You take an old rake.~|~translationMissing
A seed dibber~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a seed dibber~|~translationMissing
The only dibber you find has a bent dibbing bit. You should use the one you have.~|~translationMissing
You take an old seed dibber.~|~translationMissing
A watering can~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a watering can~|~translationMissing
You can't find any watering cans without holes in them, so you decide to use your own.~|~translationMissing
You take an old watering can.~|~translationMissing
All of the above!~|~translationMissing
If the player already has all the tools~|~translationMissing
The remaining stuff seems fused together in a lump of spiky, tetanus-inducing rust. Best leave it alone for now.~|~translationMissing
You help yourself to what you need.~|~translationMissing
Excuse me, but...~|~translationMissing
Zombie protester~|~translationMissing
Is there any way you could...~|~translationMissing
ARRR!~|~translationMissing
Is there anyone else I could...~|~translationMissing
Arrrrrrrrrr!!!~|~translationMissing
Fiiine...~|~translationMissing
Captain Donnie~|~translationMissing
Arr! What be ye wantin?~|~translationMissing
I, err, came to...~|~translationMissing
Tell you to leave.~|~translationMissing
I have come to tell you to leave.~|~translationMissing
Ye have?~|~translationMissing
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!~|~translationMissing
Bwahahahahahahahahahahahaha!~|~translationMissing
Wheeze...wheeze...~|~translationMissing
Gadzooks [lad/lass], that be the funniest thing I've heard all day! Say it again!~|~translationMissing
Stop [lad/lass]! I'll shatter me ribs!~|~translationMissing
Ask what you wanted.~|~translationMissing
I've come to ask you what you want.~|~translationMissing
Whadda we want? 'Rum'! When do we want it? Now!~|~translationMissing
So...if I were to give you 'rum' you would leave?~|~translationMissing
Not really [lad/lass]. If ye were to give us 'rum' we'd kill ye quickly, as opposed to over a few weeks.~|~translationMissing
Join your crew.~|~translationMissing
I've come to join your crew!~|~translationMissing
Err, I mean...~|~translationMissing
Arr! Shiver me mainbraces and make them landlubbers walk the scurvy plank, Cap'n! I've come to join yer cut- throat, bilge swillin' crew! Also, arr!~|~translationMissing
Are ye quite done, [lad/lass]?~|~translationMissing
Yes, for the time being anyway.~|~translationMissing
Well, ye'll be glad to know that after that little performance I'd be glad to have ye on me crew!~|~translationMissing
Huzzah!~|~translationMissing
Course, I'll have te kill ye first.~|~translationMissing
Don't ye worry, [lad/lass]. After we take the island I'll have the boss haul yer body to the temple and...~|~translationMissing
Err, never mind.~|~translationMissing
Never mind what?~|~translationMissing
Ferget I said anything.~|~translationMissing
I don't think he wants to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
50% Luke~|~translationMissing
Arr! Tryin' ter get away eh? Well ye'll never sneak past me, I'm the best lookout this crew has ever seen!~|~translationMissing
Err...look...an astonishing...thing. There. Behind you.~|~translationMissing
Ye'll have te do better than that, landlubber!~|~translationMissing
Hey you!~|~translationMissing
Zombie swab~|~translationMissing
Hey yerself, landlubber!~|~translationMissing
We interrupt this insult to bring you this soothing picture of a kitten. Normal service will be resumed shortly. Thank you for your patience.~|~translationMissing
...so that you will know exactly what time it is due to the horrible pain in your earlobes!~|~translationMissing
That be the most intimidatin' thing I've ever heard! I'm not messin' with you!~|~translationMissing
Arr! Prepare to die!~|~translationMissing
...meaning you'll need a dozen Ogres and a team of highly skilled surgeons to remove them!~|~translationMissing
Yer goin ter die!~|~translationMissing
...so that all you will be able to hear from then on will be the rustling of the ants walking through them!~|~translationMissing
Yer brave, but stupid!~|~translationMissing
...and then I'll use a wrench to remove the handles, so you'll see it every time you cough!~|~translationMissing
Who? Me?~|~translationMissing
...and I'll grind up what's left, mix it with lemon juice and throw the whole lot into the ocean!~|~translationMissing
Yer a deadman, sez I!~|~translationMissing
...leading to the eventual, violent explosion of those organs!~|~translationMissing
He seems to have vanished... you must have scared him off.~|~translationMissing
I don't think he will be causing any more trouble.~|~translationMissing
The soil here is too poor to farm on.~|~translationMissing
This is a blindweed patch. The soil has not been treated. The patch needs weeding.~|~translationMissing
You plant a seed in the blindweed patch.~|~translationMissing
I wonder how my Blindweed is coming along...~|~translationMissing
Here! I have your Blindweed!~|~translationMissing
Splendid, [lad/lass]! Go shove it in the Intake Hopper upstairs.~|~translationMissing
We'll beat them zombies yet! Arr!~|~translationMissing
Captain... I grew some blindweed but then I lost it...~|~translationMissing
There there, lad. 'Tis all right.~|~translationMissing
Here, I've been savin' some fer an emergency.~|~translationMissing
Go shove that in the Intake Hopper, and try not ter lose this lot!~|~translationMissing
I want ye to go put yer Blindweed in the intake hopper, and to be sharp about it!~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the blindweed... again~|~translationMissing
And what happens if I lose the Blindweed between here and the intake hopper?~|~translationMissing
Theoretically, of course, as it would be almost impossible for me to simply lose the stuff in the time it will take me.~|~translationMissing
Yer nothin' better than a sea-slug wearin', lilly-legged, bandy-livered landlubber!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have room in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I've got a little put aside fer an emergency. Drop some of that junk yer carryin', and come see me to get it.~|~translationMissing
Here, I was savin' a little fer an emergency, so take this and shove it in the hopper before I bung ye in there and turn the handle!~|~translationMissing
You had some all the time?~|~translationMissing
Why was I risking my neck killing pirates to grow some if you had some all along?~|~translationMissing
Less talk, [lad/lass], haven't ye got a hopper to be fillin'?~|~translationMissing
You stuff the Blindweed into the Hopper.~|~translationMissing
Well, that takes care of the Blindweed. What now?~|~translationMissing
Well, now ye've shoved the Blindweed into the mix, what we need is a bucket of stagnant water.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get some of that?~|~translationMissing
Ye won't have to go far, [lad/lass], we have a pool of the stuff here!~|~translationMissing
Here in the brewery?~|~translationMissing
No, [lad/lass], that would be a strange thing to have in a brewery!~|~translationMissing
It's up the mountain to the north.~|~translationMissing
Up a mountain?~|~translationMissing
Well, 'tis technically a volcano, but ye get the general idea.~|~translationMissing
And I assume the place is crawling with these zombies?~|~translationMissing
No [lad/lass], there be not a zombie in sight.~|~translationMissing
Oh, good!~|~translationMissing
All ye have to do is get past the keen-eyed lookout that's been spottin' my men when I send 'em.~|~translationMissing
I'll tell ye that it won't be easy!~|~translationMissing
When is it ever...~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have an empty bucket~|~translationMissing
Don't ferget yer bucket!~|~translationMissing
(The player is given an empty bucket. If the inventory is full, this line still occurs, but no bucket will appear.)~|~translationMissing
To get off yer lazy behind and head out to the stagnant lake on top of the volcano.~|~translationMissing
Chop chop, lad.~|~translationMissing
(says one of the distraction dialogues)~|~translationMissing
You scoop up a bucket of stagnant water.~|~translationMissing
Hey! What are you doing out there?~|~translationMissing
Well Cap'n Donnie said no livin' landlubbers were allowed out of the compound.~|~translationMissing
So get yerself back in here, or yer for it!~|~translationMissing
I want ye to go pour yer bucket into yonder hopper.~|~translationMissing
Take yer time, lad, we're only bein' besieged by zombies.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the bucket of water~|~translationMissing
Err... Captain...~|~translationMissing
Aye, what is it, lad?~|~translationMissing
Well, on my way over to the hopper some big boy stole the bucket and ran away...~|~translationMissing
Well, 'tis a good job I saved a little, isn't it? Now get rid of something so I can give it to ye.~|~translationMissing
Give me strength!~|~translationMissing
If ye weren't so good at distractin' the zombies I'd skin ye alive!~|~translationMissing
Take this bucket and pour it into the hopper. If ye don't get it right this time I'll have yer guts fer garters!~|~translationMissing
You dump the water into the hopper.~|~translationMissing
So is that everything?~|~translationMissing
No, [lad/lass], next ye'll need to go outside and catch five loads of slugings fer the brew.~|~translationMissing
What? Sluglings? That's disgusting!~|~translationMissing
Arr, [lad/lass], that it be.~|~translationMissing
Why Sluglings?~|~translationMissing
'Cos, [lad/lass] they're one of our super-secret ingredients! Yer not too susceptible to mind control are ye [lad/lass]?~|~translationMissing
Because they have been known te, well, influence people every now and again.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure ye've got nothing te worry about!~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Sea Slug quest~|~translationMissing
They aren't related to those Seaslugs are they?~|~translationMissing
No [lad/lass], we just call them 'Sluglings' 'cos of a long and convoluted story involvin' a metal pipe and three dead seagulls.~|~translationMissing
Aye they're related! Tis a good job they'll starve if they tried te eat yer brains!~|~translationMissing
So what should I do with these Sluglings anyway?~|~translationMissing
Well, Ye shove them in the Pressure Barrel in the attic.~|~translationMissing
And then ye...~|~translationMissing
And then I...~|~translationMissing
Pressurise 'em.~|~translationMissing
Pressurise them?!~|~translationMissing
Just a little.~|~translationMissing
Look, we don't have all day, get movin'.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have free inventory space~|~translationMissing
Ye'll be needin' a fishbowl in a big net to help ye catch them slimy little blighters.~|~translationMissing
Pity ye ain't got any free space to carry one.~|~translationMissing
Here. Ye'll need this to catch them.~|~translationMissing
What should I do with it?~|~translationMissing
Just dunk it in the water. I'm sure a clever [lad/lass] like yerself will have no problem.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and if ye haul up some squiddy-looking things, don't hesitate to shove 'em in the barrel too.~|~translationMissing
They add a special, fishy texture to the drink.~|~translationMissing
I want ye to go outside and catch five sea creatures from the squid fishin' spot.~|~translationMissing
When ye've grabbed them, jam 'em in the barrel in the attic and pressurise 'em.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a fishbowl and net~|~translationMissing
How am I suppost to catch these things?~|~translationMissing
Ye'll be needin' to use a fishbowl in a big net to snare these little devils.~|~translationMissing
And if I don't have one?~|~translationMissing
Why, I oughta...~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have inventory space~|~translationMissing
Come see me when yer not so laden down. I've got another one fer ye if ye need it.~|~translationMissing
Here! Try not ter lose this one! These things don't grow on trees, ye know.~|~translationMissing
You do not have the correct equipment to fish here.~|~translationMissing
You do not have any free space for anything that you will catch!~|~translationMissing
Gah! Get that slimy thing away from me!~|~translationMissing
The slugs are talking to me... They tell me to do bad things...~|~translationMissing
Gimme that!~|~translationMissing
The Captain takes the Slugling and stamps on it until it stops squirming, then hands it back.~|~translationMissing
Egad... what just happened?~|~translationMissing
What happened is ye were messin' about with Sluglings!~|~translationMissing
Don't ye have anything better to do?~|~translationMissing
You stuff the squirming Sluglings into the barrel.~|~translationMissing
You stuff the squirming Karamthultu into the barrel.~|~translationMissing
You do not yet have give sea creatures in the barrel!~|~translationMissing
You pressurise the asserted sea creatures.~|~translationMissing
How could I kill my sluggy brethern...?~|~translationMissing
Snap out of it, [lad/lass]! Yer in slug-shock!~|~translationMissing
Gah! Sorry about that.~|~translationMissing
No problem. Well, now ye have just one more ingredient to grab, and then we can get this 'rum' flowin!~|~translationMissing
Well, how far away will I have to go to grab it?~|~translationMissing
Not far at all, [lad/lass]. Ye've just got to get it from the basement!~|~translationMissing
Great! What is it?~|~translationMissing
Hold yer horses, [lad/lass]! While ye was off gallivantin' with yer slimy aquatic playmates, the 'rum' achieved spiritual critical mass.~|~translationMissing
To put it in terms ye'll understand~|~translationMissing
the brewin' equipment is possessed.~|~translationMissing
Possessed!~|~translationMissing
Don't ye worry yerself about it! This happens all the time.~|~translationMissing
Well, to tell the truth, my lads are a little quicker off the mark, so it only happens occasionally.~|~translationMissing
Not that I'm criticisin' yer performance, [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
Give the controls a couple of belts with this wrench.~|~translationMissing
One of the lads did a little priestin' on the side before he came here. Get him to bless it and ye'll do fine.~|~translationMissing
I want yeto go clear the Evil Spirit out of the brewin' controls. Use the wrench I gave ye, but get it blessed first.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the wrench~|~translationMissing
Mumblemumblewhatwrenchmumble...~|~translationMissing
What were that?~|~translationMissing
I said, what if I've lost the wrench?~|~translationMissing
Arr, ye landlubber!~|~translationMissing
Calm down, remember yer ulcer...~|~translationMissing
Look, I've got another wrench, but ye don't have any free space fer it. Come back when ye do.~|~translationMissing
Arr! I'd get more work out of a minty flavoured brick!~|~translationMissing
If ye lose this one I'll have ye turned inside out, covered with spiders and turned rightside in so they'll eat ye alive!~|~translationMissing
Steady on!~|~translationMissing
Come out and face me!~|~translationMissing
Well, it seems that this wrench is just not holy enough to work. You should go and get it blessed.~|~translationMissing
You used to be a priest, right?~|~translationMissing
I didn't nick anything, guv. I've got twenty people who'll swear blind I was...~|~translationMissing
Never mind. I need some help with the spirit in the brewing equipment.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll bless something for you if you need it, but just don't spread it around that I'm giving out freebies.~|~translationMissing
Could you bless this wrench for me?~|~translationMissing
Nope?~|~translationMissing
Nope. You don't strike me as being... devout, you know?~|~translationMissing
Your holy aura, it's a little shoddy, if you catch my drift.~|~translationMissing
You need a Prayer level of 47.~|~translationMissing
Oh!~|~translationMissing
Well why didn't you just say so?~|~translationMissing
I might have had a bit of an overestimation problem guv. I'm sure it won't happen again.~|~translationMissing
I didn't nick anything, [guv/miss]. I've got twenty people who'll swear blind I was...~|~translationMissing
What? Never mind. I need some help with the spirit in the brewing equipment.~|~translationMissing
Trust me, [guv/miss], lots of people need help after coming into contact with the spirits we produce here.~|~translationMissing
Can you bless this wrench for me?~|~translationMissing
I might well do. Remember, only the first one's free.~|~translationMissing
Dominoes Ad Nauseum, Romanes Eunt Domus.~|~translationMissing
Sorted.~|~translationMissing
Oh, you want the full package deal.~|~translationMissing
All right. Brace yourself.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays and the wrench is blessed.~|~translationMissing
Groovy~|~translationMissing
No problem, [guv/miss]. Good luck with your little problem.~|~translationMissing
You might find that little wrench worth hanging on to after you're done with the Spirit.~|~translationMissing
Really? I mean, it's holy and everything, but I don't think it looks all that useful.~|~translationMissing
Well, it may not look much, but you'll find that you might need a few less prayer potions if you have it in your pack, if you know what I mean.~|~translationMissing
Well, no. I don't know what you mean, but I'm sure I'll find out!~|~translationMissing
You mean more help? I've already blessed one wrench for you, that should be enough.~|~translationMissing
I want ye to go clear the Evil Spirit out of the brewin' controls. Use the wrench I gave ye, but get it blessed first.~|~translationMissing
I see ye've got the wrench good and blessed, so go whack the controls till the Evil Spirit pops out.~|~translationMissing
I see ye've got the wrench good and blessed, so go whack the hopper 'til the Evil Spirit pops out.~|~translationMissing
The power of Guthix compels you!~|~translationMissing
The Evil Spirit is forced from the controls!~|~translationMissing
The Evil Spirit has already manifested!~|~translationMissing
You have banished the Evil Spirit!~|~translationMissing
Well, now that ye've got that spirit out of there ye can dump in the final ingredient.~|~translationMissing
And that is?~|~translationMissing
We need the body of a diseased Fever Spider!~|~translationMissing
Remind me never to drink anything you have ever made. Or touched.~|~translationMissing
When yer quite done flappin' yer lips, go down into the basement and whack spiders until ye find a fever spider body.~|~translationMissing
Shove it in the hopper, and then we're in business.~|~translationMissing
They'll give it to ye if ye aren't wearin' somethin' too thick fer them to bite through.~|~translationMissing
I want ye to go kill a Fever Spider and jam its body in the hopper.~|~translationMissing
Whenever yer ready, [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
What are ye doin', [lad/lass]?  I want ye to shove that in the hopper, not in me face!~|~translationMissing
Ye just can't get good help these days...~|~translationMissing
You cram the diseased Fever Spider body into the hopper.~|~translationMissing
Well, I stuck your spider in the hopper, what now?~|~translationMissing
Now ye stand well back and watch the glory of brewin' at its best!~|~translationMissing
Aye [lad/lass]! Now get outside and feed that stuff to the pirates.~|~translationMissing
Try givin' it to the Captain, he's in charge. Get him bladdered and the rest will fall!~|~translationMissing
Ye'll need to use that bucket of yours. Most stuff can't stand bein' in contact with our 'rum' fer too long.~|~translationMissing
Took us a lot of dissolvin' to work that one out.~|~translationMissing
So, what did he say?~|~translationMissing
The Cap'n!~|~translationMissing
Oh! I haven't spoken to him yet!~|~translationMissing
Well, get a move on!~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't gotten 'rum' yet~|~translationMissing
And don't ferget the 'rum'!~|~translationMissing
You carefully fill the bucket with the foul-smelling swill.~|~translationMissing
Be that the finest, most abrasive 'rum' I've ever smelled?~|~translationMissing
Yes! That it be!~|~translationMissing
Hand it over or I'll run ye through!~|~translationMissing
The Captain drinks the 'rum' as quickly as possible.~|~translationMissing
Arr. Ye be a good [lad/lass], fer a filthy livin' landlubber.~|~translationMissing
So... I take it your boss will be pleased?~|~translationMissing
Arr, that he will. I'll tell...~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute...~|~translationMissing
Arr, ye tricky dog!~|~translationMissing
Ye tried to trick old Donnie!~|~translationMissing
Oh well, I guess I'll have to try again.~|~translationMissing
Arr, [lad/lass], you tried to trick me, but i was too clever for ye!~|~translationMissing
Besides, Rabid Jack would have my hide if I told ye it were him that sent me!~|~translationMissing
I'm sure he would. Good job you caught me out, eh!~|~translationMissing
Aye! Now get ye gone, and don't return without more 'rum'!~|~translationMissing
Hey you! I can smell the 'rum' on ye!~|~translationMissing
If it isn't in my belly by the time I cout ter three, I'll have ye flogged!~|~translationMissing
Donnie drinks the 'rum' like it is water.~|~translationMissing
Arrr...that hits the spot...~|~translationMissing
You thankfully have no need to do that any more.~|~translationMissing
Not much that was coherent.~|~translationMissing
Who is Rabid Jack?~|~translationMissing
Rabid Jack!~|~translationMissing
THE Rabid Jack!~|~translationMissing
Egad...I haven't heard that name...~|~translationMissing
...before.~|~translationMissing
So, who is he?~|~translationMissing
Dunno [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
Almost as if I aren't changing subjects, well done!~|~translationMissing
With those rottin' dogs legless they'll never keep fighting us now, so we've decided to stay here and keep the 'rum' flowin!~|~translationMissing
Thanks, [lad/lass]. We'd never have managed without ye!~|~translationMissing

4.1 Talking to Sedridor~|~translationMissing
Have you any quests for me?~|~translationMissing
Well, I wouldn't describe it as a quest, but there is something I could use some help with.~|~translationMissing
We were recently sorting through some of the things stored down in the cellar, and we found this old talisman.~|~translationMissing
The Duke shows you a talisman.~|~translationMissing
The Order of Wizards over at the Wizards' Tower have been on the hunt for magical artefacts recently. I wonder if this might be just the kind of thing they're after.~|~translationMissing
Would you be willing to take it to them for me?~|~translationMissing
Sure, no problem.~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much. You'll find the Wizards' Tower south west of here, across the bridge from Draynor Village. When you arrive, look for Sedridor. He is the Archmage of the wizards there.~|~translationMissing
The Duke hands you the talisman.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. Hopefully I can find someone else to help.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the talisman~|~translationMissing
Did you take that talisman to Sedridor?~|~translationMissing
No, I lost it.~|~translationMissing
Ah, well that explains things. One of my servants found it outside, and it seemed too much of a coincidence that another would suddenly show up.~|~translationMissing
Here, take it to the Wizards' Tower, south west of here. Please try not to lose it this time.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the talisman~|~translationMissing
Take that talisman I gave you to Sedridor at the Wizards' Tower. You'll find it south west of here, across the bridge from Draynor Village.~|~translationMissing
Welcome adventurer, to the world renowned Wizards' Tower, home to the Order of Wizards. We are the oldest and most prestigious group of wizards around. Now, how may I help you?~|~translationMissing
Are you Sedridor?~|~translationMissing
Sedridor? What is it you want with him?~|~translationMissing
The Duke of Lumbridge sent me to find him. I have this talisman he found. He said Sedridor would be interested in it.~|~translationMissing
Did he now? Well hand it over then, and we'll see what all the hubbub is about.~|~translationMissing
Okay, here you are.~|~translationMissing
You hand the talisman to Sedridor.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Doesn't seem to be anything too special. Just a normal air talisman by the looks of things. Still, looks can be deceiving. Let me take a closer look...~|~translationMissing
Sedridor murmurs some sort of incantation and the talisman glows slightly.~|~translationMissing
How interesting... It would appear I spoke too soon. There's more to this talisman than meets the eye. In fact, it may well be the last piece of the puzzle.~|~translationMissing
Puzzle?~|~translationMissing
Indeed! The lost legacy of the first tower. This talisman may in fact be key to finding the forgotten essence mine!~|~translationMissing
First tower? Forgotten essence mine? What are you on about?~|~translationMissing
Ah, my apologies, adventurer. Allow me to fill you in.~|~translationMissing
As you are likely aware, when we cast spells, we do so using the power of runes.~|~translationMissing
These runes are crafted from a highly unique material, and then imbued with magical power from various runic altars. Different altars create different runes with different magical effects.~|~translationMissing
The process of imbuing runes is called runecrafting. Legend has it that this was once a common art, but the secrets of how to do it were lost until just under two hundred years ago.~|~translationMissing
The rediscovery of runecrafting had such a large impact on the world, that it marked the dawn of the Fifth Age. It also resulted in the birth of our order, and the construction of the first Wizards' Tower.~|~translationMissing
If it was the first tower, I'm guessing it doesn't exist anymore? What happened?~|~translationMissing
It was burnt down by traitorous members of our own order. They followed the evil god of chaos, Zamorak, and they wished to claim our magical discoveries in his name.~|~translationMissing
When the tower burnt down, much was lost, including an important incantation. A spell that could be used to teleport to a hidden essence mine.~|~translationMissing
The essence mine you mentioned earlier, I assume?~|~translationMissing
Precisely. Rune essence is the material used to make runes, but it is incredibly rare. That essence mine was the only place it could be found that our order knew of.~|~translationMissing
Since the incantation was lost, we have struggled to maintain our stocks of rune essence.~|~translationMissing
There are seemingly those out there that still know where to find some, but while they have been willing to sell essence to us, they have refused to share knowledge on how to find it ourselves.~|~translationMissing
I'm starting to see why this is so important. So you think this talisman can help you rediscover that incantation?~|~translationMissing
I do! All magic leaves traces, and from what I can tell, this talisman was used heavily during the time of the first tower.~|~translationMissing
It would have been taken to the essence mine many times, and the magical energies there will have left an imprint on it. To think that it was hidden in Lumbridge all this time!~|~translationMissing
So what happens now?~|~translationMissing
It is critical I share this discovery with my associate, Aubury, as soon as possible. He's not much of a wizard, but he's an expert on runecrafting, and his insight will be essential.~|~translationMissing
Would you be willing to visit him for me? I would go myself, but I wish to study this talisman some more.~|~translationMissing
Yes, certainly.~|~translationMissing
He runs a rune shop in the south east of Varrock. Please, take this package of research notes to him. If all goes well, the secrets of the essence mine may soon be ours once more!~|~translationMissing
Sedridor hands you a package.~|~translationMissing
Best of luck, [player name].~|~translationMissing
If the player initially refused to give the talisman to him~|~translationMissing
If the player gave the talisman to him without doubting his identity~|~translationMissing
I don't remember telling you my name... How do you know it?~|~translationMissing
Really now? I am the Archmage you know.~|~translationMissing
As you wish adventurer. I will continue to study this talisman you have brought me. Return here if you find yourself with some spare time to help me.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm not interested.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Well I guess the short of it is that this talisman could be key to helping us rediscover an important teleportation incantation.~|~translationMissing
With it, we'll be able to access a hidden essence mine, our lost source of rune essence.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the talisman~|~translationMissing
I don't seem to have it with me.~|~translationMissing
Hmm? You are a very odd person. Come back again when you have it.~|~translationMissing
No, I'll only give it to Sedridor.~|~translationMissing
Well good news, for I am Sedridor! Now, hand it over and let me have a proper look at it, hmm?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't think you are Sedridor.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Well, I admire your caution adventurer. Perhaps I can prove myself? I will use my mental powers to discover...~|~translationMissing
Your name is... [player name]!~|~translationMissing
You're right! How did you know that?~|~translationMissing
Well I am the Archmage you know! You don't get to my position without learning a few tricks along the way!~|~translationMissing
So now that I have proved myself to you, why don't you hand over that talisman, hmm?~|~translationMissing
Hello again, adventurer. Did you take that package to Aubury?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the package~|~translationMissing
I lost it. Could I have another?~|~translationMissing
Well it's a good job I have copies of everything.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the package~|~translationMissing
He runs a rune shop in the south east of Varrock. Please deliver it to him soon.~|~translationMissing
Aubury~|~translationMissing
Do you want to buy some runes?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes please!~|~translationMissing
I've been sent here with a package for you.~|~translationMissing
A package? From who?~|~translationMissing
From Sedridor at the Wizards' Tower.~|~translationMissing
From Sedridor? But... surely, he can't have? Please, let me have it. It must be extremely important for him to have sent a stranger.~|~translationMissing
You hand the package to Aubury.~|~translationMissing
Now, let's have a look...~|~translationMissing
Aubury goes through the package of research notes.~|~translationMissing
This... this is incredible.~|~translationMissing
My gratitude to you adventurer for bringing me these research notes. Thanks to you, I think we finally have it.~|~translationMissing
You mean the incantation?~|~translationMissing
Well when we combine my own research with this latest discovery, I think we might just...~|~translationMissing
No, no, I'm getting ahead of myself. The signs are promising, but let's not jump to any conclusions just yet.~|~translationMissing
Here, take these notes back to Sedridor. They should hopefully give him everything he needs.~|~translationMissing
Aubury hands you some research notes.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the package~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah... about that... I kind of don't have it with me...~|~translationMissing
What kind of person says they have a delivery for me, but not with them? Honestly.~|~translationMissing
Come back when you have it.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Oh, it's a rune shop. No thank you, then.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Did you take those notes back to Sedridor?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I lost them.~|~translationMissing
Well, luckily I have duplicates. It's a good thing they are written in code. I wouldn't want the wrong kind of person to get access to the information contained within.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the notes~|~translationMissing
Don't take too long. He'll be eager to see if this is indeed the breakthrough we were hoping for.~|~translationMissing
Now, did you want to buy some runes?~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]. How goes your quest? Have you delivered my research to Aubury yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have. He gave me some notes to give to you.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! Let's have a look then.~|~translationMissing
You hand the notes to Sedridor.~|~translationMissing
Alright, let's see what Aubury has for us...~|~translationMissing
Yes, this is it! The lost incantation!~|~translationMissing
So you'll be able to access that essence mine now?~|~translationMissing
That's right! Because of you, our order finally has a proper source of rune essence again! Thank you, friend.~|~translationMissing
If you ever want to access the essence mine yourself, just let me know. It's the least I can do.~|~translationMissing
I will also share the incantation with others, including Aubury. When I do, I'll let them know that you are to be given unlimited access to the mine.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and you can have this air talisman back as well. I have no further need of it, and I'm sure you will find it useful.~|~translationMissing
In case you didn't know, the talisman can be used to craft air runes. Just take it to the Air Altar south of Falador along with some rune essence.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry if you can't find the altar. The talisman can guide you there. You may find talismans for other altars as well while adventuring. They'll let you craft other types of rune.~|~translationMissing
Great! Thanks!~|~translationMissing
My pleasure!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the notes~|~translationMissing
Err, you're not going to believe this...~|~translationMissing
I don't have them.~|~translationMissing
Right... You're rather careless aren't you. I suggest you go and speak to Aubury once more. With luck he will have made copies.~|~translationMissing

5.2 Defeating the creature~|~translationMissing
Hey! I need to talk to you!~|~translationMissing
Start the Secrets of the North quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes, you. I have some questions.~|~translationMissing
You were recently hired by Sir Ceril Carnillean, correct?~|~translationMissing
That's right... he wanted me to find some cultists that stole his armour.~|~translationMissing
And were you successful?~|~translationMissing
And have you had any contact with the Carnilleans since your success?~|~translationMissing
And have you had any contact with the Carnilleans since your failure?~|~translationMissing
Not really...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'm very confused. What's all this about?~|~translationMissing
An unthinkable crime has taken place, and as someone who has recently had contact with the Carnilleans, you are one of our suspects.~|~translationMissing
A crime? What's happened?~|~translationMissing
Until I am satisfied that you were not involved, I can't say.~|~translationMissing
Well then what do I need to do to convince you I wasn't?~|~translationMissing
The guard leans in closer and whispers to you.~|~translationMissing
Sorry about all this. I'm pretty confident you had nothing to do with any of it, but I need to put on a good show for Lady Carnillean.~|~translationMissing
Well I must say adventurer, that is quite the alibi. You clearly had no involvement in this horrific crime.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm glad we could...~|~translationMissing
And what's that? You want to help us find the culprit? How generous of you!~|~translationMissing
But I never said...~|~translationMissing
The guard gives you a pleading look.~|~translationMissing
Of course! I would never sit by while criminals are on the loose! You will have all the help you need!~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Please join me upstairs when you're ready to begin.~|~translationMissing
The guard heads upstairs.~|~translationMissing
What on Gielinor have I just agreed to?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I need to get going.~|~translationMissing
How could this happen? How? Will our pain never end?~|~translationMissing
Leave me at once! I don't want to talk right now.~|~translationMissing
It's not fair! All the bad things keep happening to us! Why don't they happen to anyone else?~|~translationMissing
What's happened?~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't talk to you. You might be one of the bad people.~|~translationMissing
This poor family. I don't know how much more they can take.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I shouldn't be talking to you about it.~|~translationMissing
Is that...?~|~translationMissing
Sir Ceril Carnillean.~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you could help work that out.~|~translationMissing
Well I guess we should get started right away. What do we know so far?~|~translationMissing
If the player opposed the cult~|~translationMissing
It happened in the early hours of the morning. According to Lady Carnillean, Sir Ceril heard a noise coming from Butler Jones' old room. He got up to investigate.~|~translationMissing
After a few moments, she heard Sir Ceril shout something, followed by a scream. She went to see what was happening, and this is what she found.~|~translationMissing
So no one else was in the room?~|~translationMissing
Not that she saw.~|~translationMissing
Where was everyone else at this point?~|~translationMissing
I was the guard on duty last night. I was stationed out front as usual. Claus, the family chef, was down in the kitchen preparing an early breakfast for Sir Ceril.~|~translationMissing
Young Philipe was in bed. He slept through the entire thing.~|~translationMissing
Do we have any obvious suspects?~|~translationMissing
Jones is behind bars, but many of his fellow cultists are still at large. Perhaps this was an act of revenge on their part.~|~translationMissing
If the player helped the cult~|~translationMissing
It happened in the early hours of the morning. According to Lady Carnillean, Sir Ceril heard a noise coming from Butler Jones' room. He got up to investigate.~|~translationMissing
Young Philipe was in bed. He slept through the entire thing. Jones himself was downstairs at the time, but he vanished before we could question him.~|~translationMissing
Jones vanished?~|~translationMissing
Indeed. That, along with the murder occurring in his room, makes him a prime suspect.~|~translationMissing
Apart from Jones, do we have any other suspects?~|~translationMissing
We also have those cultists that broke in a while back. Following his disappearance, we can't help but wonder if Jones might have been in league with them...~|~translationMissing
We can't rule anything out.~|~translationMissing
There's a few other things to note, but it's probably best if you have a look around the crime scene before we go any further.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. I'll begin at once.~|~translationMissing
Are you done looking around the crime scene?~|~translationMissing
Not to worry. Take all the time you need.~|~translationMissing
The body is that of Sir Ceril Carnillean. He's lying face down on the floor, with the cause of death seemingly a single stab wound to the back. The wound looks to have been caused by an unusually thin blade.~|~translationMissing
The window has been broken. The glass on the floor suggests it was broken from the outside.~|~translationMissing
The wall looks to have been slightly damaged. You knock on it. It sounds like there's a hollow space on the other side.~|~translationMissing
The false wall looks to have been slightly damaged.~|~translationMissing
Someone has forced the chest open, breaking it in the process. If anything was in the chest, it's now gone.~|~translationMissing
Someone has forced the chest open, breaking it in the process.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... was someone after Hazeel's restoration scroll?~|~translationMissing
I think I've seen everything I need to. I should check in with the guard.~|~translationMissing
Find anything of note?~|~translationMissing
The window was broken from the outside.~|~translationMissing
I didn't see anyone leave or enter from the front of the building last night, so that makes sense. The window must have been their way in and out.~|~translationMissing
So it was likely someone who didn't have any other way to access the mansion. We can probably rule out staff and family members.~|~translationMissing
Agreed. Did you find anything else?~|~translationMissing
Ceril was stabbed from behind.~|~translationMissing
So he wasn't facing his killer. But if that were the case, why did Lady Carnillean say she heard him shouting? Surely he'd have been facing whoever he was shouting at.~|~translationMissing
That could mean there were two people in the room with him.~|~translationMissing
Let's hope not. One killer on the loose is bad enough.~|~translationMissing
There's something else as well. It looks like the blade used to kill him was unusually thin.~|~translationMissing
Really? How odd. I'll make a note to look into that once we're done here.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, did you find anything else?~|~translationMissing
A hidden room above us was broken into.~|~translationMissing
A hidden room? What hidden room?~|~translationMissing
It looks like it can only be accessed from in here. It doesn't seem like anyone has been in there for some time.~|~translationMissing
What's in this room?~|~translationMissing
There's a chest up there that's been broken into.~|~translationMissing
Do you think they took anything from it?~|~translationMissing
This raises more questions than answers. Was this actually a murder, or just a robbery gone wrong? And how was there a hidden room that we knew nothing about?~|~translationMissing
Did you find anything else?~|~translationMissing
I think that's everything.~|~translationMissing
So someone broke in from the outside, something may have been stolen from a hidden room upstairs, and Sir Ceril was stabbed in the back. All useful information, but none of it gives us anything definitive.~|~translationMissing
Thankfully, we do have one more lead that might hold some promise. Take a look at this.~|~translationMissing
The guard shows you an amulet with a skull on it.~|~translationMissing
I found this by the window. That skull on it is the symbol of the Khazard Army. There's also a name engraved into the back~|~translationMissing
'Evelot'.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like we need to find this Evelot and see what they know.~|~translationMissing
While I agree, my superiors won't be happy if I open an investigation into a member of the Khazard Army. I think you'll need to handle this bit yourself. Besides, I need to take care of matters here.~|~translationMissing
If you want a place to start, I'd suggest the bar at the Fight Arena. Places like that are always good for gathering information.~|~translationMissing
Good idea.~|~translationMissing
Should we not look into the Hazeel Cult as well?~|~translationMissing
They're definitely top suspects, but we don't have any actual evidence linking them to the crime. Until we do, this Evelot lead seems like a safer bet.~|~translationMissing
Why can't you investigate the Khazard Army yourself?~|~translationMissing
The matter is... complicated. On paper, General Khazard is an upstanding citizen, and his private army operates with approval from the crown. King Lathas even hired them for some peacekeeping once.~|~translationMissing
It's fair to say that Khazard is a bit... controversial. His war with the gnomes is creating more than a few problems for Kandarin, not to mention the rumours about the people fighting in his arena...~|~translationMissing
If Song of the Elves has not been completed~|~translationMissing
For now though, King Lathas considers him a valuable ally. As such, it is preferred we maintain a good relationship with him and his army.~|~translationMissing
If Song of the Elves has been completed~|~translationMissing
Unlike his predecessor, King Thoros is keen to slowly distance himself from Khazard. However, in the meantime, we have to maintain a good relationship with him and his army.~|~translationMissing
And that's where I come in. I understand.~|~translationMissing
(If the player helped the cult~|~translationMissing
) Don't you think I should try and find Jones?~|~translationMissing
No need to worry. Some of our best are already out searching for him. I'm sure he won't get far.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could help them?~|~translationMissing
Your concern is appreciated, but they'll be fine. You're better off focusing on Evelot.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Well don't be gone too long. We have work to do here.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll have a beer please.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'd like a Khali Brew please.~|~translationMissing
Do you know anyone called Evelot?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for them.~|~translationMissing
It's not my place to go giving out information to people I don't know.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? I could make it worth your while.~|~translationMissing
Are you suggesting that I'm the kind of person that would besmirch my honour for a measly bribe?~|~translationMissing
Because you'd be absolutely right! 100 coins will pay for the information you desire.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 100 coins~|~translationMissing
Alright, here's the money.~|~translationMissing
You give 100 coins to the barman.~|~translationMissing
So what can you tell me about Evelot?~|~translationMissing
So oddly enough, she was in here not that long ago, but just before you arrived, one of the lads came in and spoke to her.~|~translationMissing
To say what?~|~translationMissing
No idea, but she left in quite the hurry afterwards. Perhaps you'll be able to pick up her trail if you look around outside.~|~translationMissing
I might just do that. Thanks for the information.~|~translationMissing
Fancy a drink before you go?~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll come back when I have the money.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Got any news?~|~translationMissing
Evelot, I presume?~|~translationMissing
Evelot~|~translationMissing
If you think I'm coming quietly, you've got another thing coming!~|~translationMissing
Attack 4 plays and the fight with Evelot begins.~|~translationMissing
Alright, that's enough! You win!~|~translationMissing
So will you answer my questions now?~|~translationMissing
It doesn't seem like I have any other choice.~|~translationMissing
Ceril Carnillean has been murdered, and an amulet belonging to you was found at the scene of the crime.~|~translationMissing
What? My amulet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, quite sloppy of you.~|~translationMissing
Don't patronise me! Do you really think I'd be so foolish as to leave my own amulet at the scene of a murder? The amulet was stolen a few days ago. Someone must have planted it there to set me up!~|~translationMissing
I knew I shouldn't have taken this job!~|~translationMissing
Job? What job?~|~translationMissing
I needed money, badly. Some guy hired me for a simple robbery. Nice and straightforward, he said. All I had to do was break into that Carnillean house and retrieve something for him.~|~translationMissing
Who was this person?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. He kept his face hidden. All I know is that he was willing to pay a lot.~|~translationMissing
And what did he want you to steal?~|~translationMissing
Just some random scroll.~|~translationMissing
So what happened to Ceril?~|~translationMissing
That had nothing to do with me! I admit, he saw me on my way out, but I was able to escape. I only found out he was dead after I got back to the Fight Arena!~|~translationMissing
Hmm... What about this scroll? What was it?~|~translationMissing
No idea. I was told to deliver it to some cultists south of the city, which I did.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so it was the Hazeel Cult that hired you. That's not surprising.~|~translationMissing
No, that's the thing. They were very happy when I gave them the scroll, but they had no idea I'd been hired to retrieve it!~|~translationMissing
What? But if that's the case, then who hired you?~|~translationMissing
I told you, I don't know! He was meant to meet me in the bar earlier to pay me, but he never showed up. This is such a mess!~|~translationMissing
Just some random scroll, but it wasn't even there! The whole thing was for nothing!~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Say the scroll had been there, what were you supposed to do with it?~|~translationMissing
I was told to deliver it to some cultists south of the city.~|~translationMissing
What? But that doesn't make sense. The reason the scroll wasn't there is because the Hazeel Cult already managed to steal it. Why would they hire you to steal it again?~|~translationMissing
I told you, I don't even know who hired me! The guy was meant to meet me in the bar earlier to pay me, but he never showed up. This is such a mess!~|~translationMissing
I don't like this. Something very strange is going on here. I need to find this person that hired you.~|~translationMissing
Good luck with that. He didn't seem like the kind of person who'd want to be found.~|~translationMissing
Well then I guess my best bet is to pay a visit to the Hazeel Cult. They're involved in some way, even if they themselves don't realise it.~|~translationMissing
So am I free to go?~|~translationMissing
I won't stop you, but you should consider going to the authorities. They might be able to help you.~|~translationMissing
Ha! Nice joke. I'm better off on my own.~|~translationMissing
If you're sure. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
I thought you were going to see that cult?~|~translationMissing
I will be soon.~|~translationMissing
Well I've told you everything I know, so no reason for you to still be lurking around here.~|~translationMissing
Well, well, well, what do we have here?~|~translationMissing
Lord Hazeel, this is the adventurer who killed Alomone and got Jones captured.~|~translationMissing
I see. So it was your actions that prevented my followers from bringing about my restoration?~|~translationMissing
Er... I guess so.~|~translationMissing
There was once a time when any who dared oppose me would flee to the furthest corners of this world to escape my wrath. Alas, it seems that in my absence, you mortals have grown arrogant once more.~|~translationMissing
It is no matter though, for your fate will be a reminder of what happens to those foolish enough to cross a Mahjarrat. Die now, knowing your efforts were in vain, for despite your best attempts, I have returned!~|~translationMissing
Before you go any further, there's something we should discuss.~|~translationMissing
And why would I want to discuss anything with you?~|~translationMissing
Because Ceril Carnillean is dead, and his killer may be trying to frame you!~|~translationMissing
Dead? How curious. Clivet, I trust this was not our work?~|~translationMissing
It was not, my lord.~|~translationMissing
Very well, adventurer. Speak your piece, but do so quickly. When you are done, I will decide if your life is forfeit.~|~translationMissing
A member of the Khazard Army called Evelot was hired to steal a scroll from the Carnillean Mansion and deliver it here.~|~translationMissing
And she was succesful. Thanks to her, my followers were able to use that scroll to bring about my restoration.~|~translationMissing
Well during her escape, Ceril Carnillean was killed, but not by her. Someone else was there, but she doesn't know who.~|~translationMissing
The evidence I've found so far suggests that the killer was trying to frame her. By extension, they might have been trying to frame you as well.~|~translationMissing
You suggest that this individual is my foe, but if that were true, why would they have arranged to have my restoration scroll delivered here?~|~translationMissing
Whoever this person is, they must be an ally to us, my lord.~|~translationMissing
And yet, an ally who hides in darkness is no true ally at all.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, you say this Evelot is part of the Khazard Army?~|~translationMissing
Then I think it's time to make my return known to my Mahjarrat kin. Clivet, summon Khazard. Let us see what he has to say of this.~|~translationMissing
Er... is now a bad time to mention that Khazard and I have a... complicated history?~|~translationMissing
Well then, I suggest you prepare yourself.~|~translationMissing
Oh boy...~|~translationMissing
Vanar! Septinar! Filinar!~|~translationMissing
Khazard appears before Hazeel, Clivet, and the player.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel? You've returned?~|~translationMissing
Surprised, Khazard? Or just disappointed?~|~translationMissing
Disappointed? I have no reason to be disappointed.~|~translationMissing
And yet you made no attempt to aid me yourself. Too busy claiming my lands as your own, perhaps?~|~translationMissing
They were our lands! And... hang on... what is this human filth doing here?~|~translationMissing
Filth? You're one to talk!~|~translationMissing
It's clear that I've allowed you to endure for far too long! Allow me to correct that mistake.~|~translationMissing
Enough! This human is no friend of mine either, but [he/she] has presented me with information regarding my return that warrants investigation.~|~translationMissing
Then kill [him/her] and let's investigate. Or has your sleep made you go soft?~|~translationMissing
Make no mistake, if the human crosses me, I will gouge out [his/her] eyes and watch as [he/she] dines on them. Until then, [he/she] may be of use.~|~translationMissing
Fine, but I hope you know this is a foolish idea. What is the information [he/she] presented?~|~translationMissing
Welcome, adventurer. It's good to see you once more.~|~translationMissing
Alomone, I need to speak with Hazeel.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that isn't possible. Lord Hazeel is currently busy with his glorious work in the north. It is not our place to disturb him.~|~translationMissing
But it's very important. Has Jones not told you what's happened?~|~translationMissing
Jones? We have not heard from him in some time.~|~translationMissing
Well then I guess I'll be the one to break the news instead. Ceril Carnillean has been murdered.~|~translationMissing
He has? What joyous news! Long have we waited for those Carnillean monsters to face the consequences of their crimes!~|~translationMissing
I'd hold off on the celebrating if I were you. Something strange is going on and I really need to talk to Hazeel about it.~|~translationMissing
Well... I suppose you have proven yourself to be a loyal servant to Hazeel. Still, I must warn you, our lord won't take kindly to being summoned unnecessarily.~|~translationMissing
I understand.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I will call upon the mighty Hazeel.~|~translationMissing
Vanar! Maradar! Dominar!~|~translationMissing
Hazeel appears.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, you have summoned me. I trust you understand that my work in the north is of the upmost urgency. I have little time for distractions.~|~translationMissing
I assure you, this is important.~|~translationMissing
Then speak.~|~translationMissing
A member of the Khazard Army called Evelot was hired to steal your restoration scroll from the Carnillean Mansion. She was meant to deliver it here, but of course, it had already been taken.~|~translationMissing
During her escape, Ceril Carnillean was killed, but not by her. Someone else was there, but she doesn't know who.~|~translationMissing
Curious. Alomone, I trust this was not our work?~|~translationMissing
Not to my knowledge, my lord. Your loyal servant, Jones, was still stationed at the mansion, but he would not have acted without instruction.~|~translationMissing
Where is Jones now?~|~translationMissing
He fled after the murder took place. The guards are still searching for him.~|~translationMissing
The actions of a coward. He will come to regret that.~|~translationMissing
There's something else as well. The evidence I've found so far suggests that the killer was trying to frame Evelot.~|~translationMissing
And you believe they were attempting to frame my followers and I as well?~|~translationMissing
That's what I'm wondering.~|~translationMissing
Forgive me, my lord, but if they aimed to frame us, why would they also try to have your restoration scroll delivered here?~|~translationMissing
A question with many possible answers, my faithful servant.~|~translationMissing
Then let us see what my Mahjarrat kin has to say about this. Alomone, summon Khazard.~|~translationMissing
Khazard appears before Hazeel, Alomone, and the player.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel? What is the meaning of this? And what is this human filth doing here?~|~translationMissing
Enough! I care not for your petty disagreements. This adventurer is under my protection. You are not to harm [him/her].~|~translationMissing
Has the once great Hazeel gone soft? Never would I have expected you to work with scum like this. I trust you know that [he'll/she'll] betray you?~|~translationMissing
And if [he/she] does, I will gouge out [his/her] eyes and watch as [he/she] dines on them. Until then, cease this prattle.~|~translationMissing
Fine, but I hope you have good reason for this.~|~translationMissing
Someone has murdered Ceril Carnillean and attempted to pass the blame onto one of your minions. Were you aware of this?~|~translationMissing
I don't involve myself in the personal affairs of my soldiers. Besides, I'd have thought you'd be happy to see that fool dead.~|~translationMissing
I shed no tears for his demise, and if his killer turns out to be a friend, I will reward them with riches beyond imagination. However, this individual and their motives remain unknown. We must rectify that.~|~translationMissing
Bah! This matter is beneath the both of us. Accept this for the gift it is and move on.~|~translationMissing
No. Any individual involving themselves in our affairs, be they friend or foe, must be made known to us, especially as the ritual draws near.~|~translationMissing
Ritual?~|~translationMissing
Keep your nose out!~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, how thorough has the investigation into Ceril Carnillean's murder been?~|~translationMissing
I'd say it's been pretty thorough. I handled most of it myself.~|~translationMissing
Have the family been questioned?~|~translationMissing
Er... not by me.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, very thorough.~|~translationMissing
No stone can be left unturned. Adventurer, you must return to the Carnillean Mansion and uncover any information you might have missed.~|~translationMissing
You're trusting [him/her] with this? Stop this madness and let me handle it instead.~|~translationMissing
This is not up for debate. I have made my will clear. Return to us once you have something, adventurer. Not before.~|~translationMissing
Why should I help you?~|~translationMissing
You came to me, not the other way around. From that, I would assume that you already have some sort of motive in finding this killer. I care not what that motive is.~|~translationMissing
Aren't you worried about my loyalties?~|~translationMissing
Loyalty means very little to my kind. You opposed me before, but now you have a chance to rectify that mistake. Do so, and you will be rewarded. Oppose me again, and you will die.~|~translationMissing
Loyalty means very little to my kind. Still, without you, I might never have been awoken from my slumber.~|~translationMissing
Continue to support me and you will continue to be rewarded. The moment you oppose me, however, is the moment you die.~|~translationMissing
Can you think of any possible suspects?~|~translationMissing
Thousands. To have lived as long as I is to have made many friends, and many enemies. Any one of them may be responsible. Without further information, it is pointless to speculate.~|~translationMissing
What is this ritual you mentioned?~|~translationMissing
It is nothing you need to concern yourself with.~|~translationMissing
The more information I have, the more help I can be.~|~translationMissing
You can be of ample help by performing the task you've been assigned. This idle chatter achieves nothing.~|~translationMissing
I'll be on my way.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hazeel has given you a task to perform. Go and get it done.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hazeel has given you a task to perform. You should go with haste.~|~translationMissing
No. Now go away.~|~translationMissing
You and Hazeel seem to have some history.~|~translationMissing
Continue to bother me and I'll make you history. Now go away.~|~translationMissing
Then go away.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Any luck at the Fight Arena?~|~translationMissing
I think so. I found Evelot and was able to question her. It seems someone might be trying to frame her.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. So what do you plan to do now?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to have another look around and ask some questions.~|~translationMissing
Well you'll be pleased to know we were able to track down Jones. He's already admitted to being part of that cult. For that alone he'll be going away for a long time. However, he's staying silent on the murder.~|~translationMissing
To be honest, with what I've discovered so far, I don't think he was involved. I suspect he just fled out of fear.~|~translationMissing
Really? He seems like the obvious suspect. If not him, then who?~|~translationMissing
That's what I'm here to find out. I'd like to have another look around and ask some questions.~|~translationMissing
Go right ahead. Lady Carnillean and Philipe are just inside, and you'll find Claus down in the kitchen.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'd like to ask you some questions about what happened.~|~translationMissing
You're the one my husband hired to deal with that cult. Some good that did!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but right now we don't even think the cult were responsible.~|~translationMissing
Who else could it be?~|~translationMissing
That's what I'm hoping to find out.~|~translationMissing
Fine. What do you want to know?~|~translationMissing
When your husband was killed, did you see anything unusual?~|~translationMissing
No. It's as I told the guard. There was a noise coming from Jones' old room. My husband went to take a look and I heard him shout something.~|~translationMissing
Did you hear what he shouted?~|~translationMissing
I didn't. I went to see what was happening, and I heard a scream. By the time I arrived, the only one there was my husband, lying on the floor.~|~translationMissing
And there was nothing else in the room that seemed odd?~|~translationMissing
No, nothing.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thank you for your help.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I'd like to ask you some questions about your dad.~|~translationMissing
What questions?~|~translationMissing
Did you see any of what happened?~|~translationMissing
No! I was in bed. Now leave me alone! I don't want to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm sorry to have bothered you.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I'd like to ask you some questions.~|~translationMissing
But I already spoke to the authorities earlier.~|~translationMissing
I know, but I'm hoping I can uncover anything they missed.~|~translationMissing
Okay, go ahead.~|~translationMissing
What were you doing at the time Ceril Carnillean was killed?~|~translationMissing
I was here in the kitchen. Sir Ceril is an early riser, and he likes a good breakfast as soon as he wakes up.~|~translationMissing
And you didn't see anything unusual down here?~|~translationMissing
You're absolutely sure? Not even the slightest thing out of place?~|~translationMissing
Well... no... not really. I guess there was the cold...~|~translationMissing
Cold?~|~translationMissing
Yes... this sudden cold feeling. I was right next to the warm stove, so it was very odd. I thought it was just some wind... but maybe...~|~translationMissing
Did you see anything when you felt this cold?~|~translationMissing
Well... I thought I saw this shadow in the room, just for a moment. Surely it was just a trick of the light though...~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I'm going to have a little look around down here, if that's okay?~|~translationMissing
Hello. Did you find anything?~|~translationMissing
I'm still working on it. Could you describe exactly what you felt and saw again?~|~translationMissing
There was this sudden cold feeling and when I turned around, I thought I saw a shadow. Surely it was just a trick of the light...~|~translationMissing
If it was anything important, I'll find it.~|~translationMissing
You search the shelves and notice a small button on the wall behind them.~|~translationMissing
Press the button?~|~translationMissing
You press the button and hear a click coming from the northern wall.~|~translationMissing
There looks to be a passage behind the wall.~|~translationMissing
Enter the passage.~|~translationMissing
You go through the passage and find yourself in a hidden room.~|~translationMissing
Leave it.~|~translationMissing
You picklock the chest and find a dusty scroll inside.~|~translationMissing
Interesting... I wonder what Hazeel will make of this.~|~translationMissing
I think so. Hopefully it can help me find the killer.~|~translationMissing
Well, good luck.~|~translationMissing
Have you completed your task? Speak with Lord Hazeel and General Khazard if so.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, is your task complete? You should speak with Lord Hazeel and General Khazard if so.~|~translationMissing
The adventurer returns. I trust this means you have something of note for us.~|~translationMissing
I found a hidden room beneath the Carnillean Mansion. There was a chest inside with a scroll in it.~|~translationMissing
A scroll?~|~translationMissing
Yes. It had a sketch on it of some sort of crest. Well... half of one, at least.~|~translationMissing
Half a crest? Could that be...?~|~translationMissing
This chest, was there nothing else inside?~|~translationMissing
Nope, just the scroll.~|~translationMissing
The crest must have been in there.~|~translationMissing
So that was their true target. But I thought it was lost... How did it get there?~|~translationMissing
The Carnilleans must have claimed it after my defeat. The fools would have had no idea of its importance.~|~translationMissing
What is this crest?~|~translationMissing
Who would even want to steal that thing? One of our kin, perhaps?~|~translationMissing
Quite possibly, though there are others who would know of it.~|~translationMissing
Are you two going to keep talking in riddles, or are you going to tell me what's going on?~|~translationMissing
Something is still amiss in all of this.~|~translationMissing
I agree, but our next move is clear. We must go north.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I've discovered the ability to turn totally invisible.~|~translationMissing
We should not waste any time. However, we must first deal with the human.~|~translationMissing
I will handle it.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, your work is done. Leave us.~|~translationMissing
What? But we haven't found the killer.~|~translationMissing
Khazard and I will deal with this matter now. As a reward for your work, consider your past transgressions against us forgiven. Now go.~|~translationMissing
Khazard and I will deal with this matter now. Once again, you have proven yourself a worthy ally to my followers and I. Now go.~|~translationMissing
A group of ice trolls have made their home near the fortress. I will join you there.~|~translationMissing
Ice trolls? Do you mean the trolls at Weiss?~|~translationMissing
Why are you still here?~|~translationMissing
Hold on. Adventurer, you know of these trolls and their lands?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, I'm quite good friends with them. You see, there's this troll called My Arm...~|~translationMissing
Nobody cares! Be gone from our sight.~|~translationMissing
If the human knows these ice trolls, [he/she] may still be of use to us.~|~translationMissing
Why? We can make short work of any trolls that disturb us. We have no need for dead weight.~|~translationMissing
Until we know more about who we are dealing with, we should avoid attracting unneeded attention.~|~translationMissing
Enough of this nonsense! If you want subtlety, we can use the Shadow Realm.~|~translationMissing
There are others who dwell in the Shadow Realm. I would prefer they be kept unaware of our presence in the north.~|~translationMissing
Fine, but on your head be it if this goes wrong.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, it seems we have further need of you after all. Meet us outside this troll settlement. Don't make us wait.~|~translationMissing
Alomone, in our absence, I trust you can take care of that matter we spoke of.~|~translationMissing
Good. Now, adventurer, it seems we have further need of you after all. Meet us outside this troll settlement. Don't make us wait.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel and Khazard teleport away.~|~translationMissing
Lord Hazeel and General Khazard require you in the north. Meet with them at the troll settlement there. Now be gone.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, Lord Hazeel and General Khazard require your presence in the north. You should join with them at the troll settlement there.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for getting our herb patches to work. Now Boulder can grow goutweed for my people, and they are very happy.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I have another copy of that book?~|~translationMissing
I'm meant to be meeting some... friends... Have you seen them?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so... The only newcomers we've had here recently are those two strange trolls outside. I hope they're not up to no good.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... okay.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) How are you two doing?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you note this basalt for me?~|~translationMissing
Big Fish~|~translationMissing
Good, you're here.~|~translationMissing
Er... what?~|~translationMissing
Dead Wolf~|~translationMissing
The idiot doesn't even know it's us.~|~translationMissing
Wait... Hazeel? Khazard? Why are you trolls?~|~translationMissing
Big Fish (Hazeel)~|~translationMissing
Given the secrecy of our task here, we felt it appropriate to shapeshift into less conspicuous forms.~|~translationMissing
Dead Wolf (General Khazard)~|~translationMissing
We? This foolish idea was yours alone.~|~translationMissing
Right... So what are we doing here?~|~translationMissing
Based on your discovery, it is likely our mysterious killer will have travelled here.~|~translationMissing
To Weiss? What would they want with the trolls?~|~translationMissing
Ha! They will have no interest in trolls.~|~translationMissing
This troll settlement is a relatively new addition to the area. It is what was here before that will be of interest to the killer.~|~translationMissing
Which is?~|~translationMissing
Which is none of your business. Now, can we get to work?~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Adventurer, while our disguises will work up to a point, I imagine any troll would soon see through them if we were to converse with them.~|~translationMissing
I doubt that. Trolls are as dumb as they come.~|~translationMissing
Our first step here is to gather information. As you claim to be friends with these trolls, you will be well placed to do so.~|~translationMissing
Speak with their leader and find out if anything of note has occurred here recently.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, speak with the leader of these trolls and find out if anything of note has occurred here recently. That will determine our next move.~|~translationMissing
Have you seen anything odd around here recently?~|~translationMissing
Odd? Like what?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure to be honest. Anything unusual I guess.~|~translationMissing
Well there's two strange trolls outside who I'm sure I haven't seen before. I hope they're not up to no good.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes... those two. I was speaking to them earlier. They're harmless... I hope.~|~translationMissing
If you want unusual, Goat Poo says he see da weirdness down in mine.~|~translationMissing
Weirdness? What kind of weirdness?~|~translationMissing
He say he see da strange shadow.~|~translationMissing
There was the cave-in recently down there as well. That's what Goat Poo was investigating when he saw the shadow.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. I think my... companions... might want to hear about this.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll be off.~|~translationMissing
We're blind here. My senses do nothing this close to the ritual marker.~|~translationMissing
Nor mine, but there is no alternative.~|~translationMissing
We wouldn't have this problem if we were in the Shadow Realm!~|~translationMissing
What are you two on about now?~|~translationMissing
Nothing! Stop eavesdropping!~|~translationMissing
It's hardly eavesdropping if you're having the conversation right in front of me.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, did you discover anything?~|~translationMissing
I did, but before we go any further, I think it's time for some answers.~|~translationMissing
You're in no place to make demands!~|~translationMissing
Well maybe I just won't tell you what I've learnt.~|~translationMissing
You waste time we may not have, adventurer, but very well. Ask your questions, but do so quickly.~|~translationMissing
Why would the killer come here?~|~translationMissing
Before the God Wars, a settlement of the old empire was found here. The fortress to the east is all that remains on the surface, but there is much still hidden below.~|~translationMissing
A great prison, sealed long ago. Half of the crest used to do so came into my possession, but it was seemingly taken by the Carnilleans after my defeat.~|~translationMissing
And the killer stole it from the Carnilleans? You think they mean to open the prison?~|~translationMissing
That is our assumption.~|~translationMissing
Where's the other half of the crest?~|~translationMissing
It was held by one of our kin, but we haven't felt his presence for some time. It's possible the killer already has it.~|~translationMissing
But why would someone want to open this prison? What's inside?~|~translationMissing
You've been told enough, human. Finish your questions and let us get back to work.~|~translationMissing
What is this ritual you keep talking about?~|~translationMissing
What do you know of our kind?~|~translationMissing
The Mahjarrat? Not a lot to be honest.~|~translationMissing
Then let's keep it that way. This question has no relevance to our purpose here, Hazeel. It doesn't warrant an answer.~|~translationMissing
If it's not relevant, why do you two keep talking about it?~|~translationMissing
It may be relevant, it may not be. It depends on who this killer is.~|~translationMissing
Well assuming it is relevant, what can you tell me about it?~|~translationMissing
The ritual is used by our kind to ensure our survival, and the next one is fast approaching. If the killer is one of our kin, their actions may be a means of preparing for it.~|~translationMissing
Preparing how?~|~translationMissing
For the rest of us to live, one of us must die. Many will go to great lengths to ensure they are not the one who is sacrificed.~|~translationMissing
That's enough! You've already shared too much.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm done asking questions. What now?~|~translationMissing
I'm done asking questions. What now?~|~translationMissing
Now you tell us what you have discovered.~|~translationMissing
There's been a cave-in down in the mine. One of the trolls apparently saw a strange shadow near it.~|~translationMissing
A shadow? Could just be troll superstition.~|~translationMissing
The cook at the Carnillean Mansion also mentioned seeing a shadow. That doesn't feel like a coincidence.~|~translationMissing
It sounds like we should investigate for ourselves. Adventurer, meet us down in this mine.~|~translationMissing
Hazeel and Khazard depart.~|~translationMissing
We have work to do, adventurer. Don't be gone too long.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... did Hazeel and Khazard already go inside?~|~translationMissing
Enter the cave?~|~translationMissing
Cutscene begins. The player arrives at a dungeon. Secrets of the North plays.~|~translationMissing
Then let's get to work. First, you can't deny this time that the human is of no further use to us.~|~translationMissing
I am here, you know?~|~translationMissing
Again with this, Khazard? [He/She] has been of great benefit so far. As long as that continues, [he/she] will remain.~|~translationMissing
And what if I disagree?~|~translationMissing
The decision is already made.~|~translationMissing
Says who? You? You don't command me! Do you think you're my lord? Or maybe you think you're my father?~|~translationMissing
No, and let us thank Zamorak for that.~|~translationMissing
Hey, stop arguing and listen! I heard something.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, let us investigate. Khazard, stay here and guard the entrance.~|~translationMissing
No. I'll go with the human. You wait here.~|~translationMissing
The player and Khazard walk towards an assassin attempting to open a strange barrier.~|~translationMissing
What the... you!~|~translationMissing
The player and Khazard begin fighting the assassin. In the Shadows plays.~|~translationMissing
What the...!~|~translationMissing
He's gone.~|~translationMissing
But where? Did he teleport?~|~translationMissing
No. Just some cheap parlour trick. He's likely still nearby.~|~translationMissing
We should look for him.~|~translationMissing
We should, but first, you have some explaining to do. You knew him.~|~translationMissing
Well 'knew' is a bit of a strong word, but we've crossed paths.~|~translationMissing
Explain, and do so quickly.~|~translationMissing
I encountered him on Entrana. He killed some monks there and stole a relic from them. I... may have been responsible for helping him, but I didn't realise until it was too late.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so you were always a fool?~|~translationMissing
You're one to talk. So what was he doing here?~|~translationMissing
And there you go aptly proving my point. As it seems I have to explain everything, this door leads to the prison Hazeel spoke of earlier.~|~translationMissing
Your friend is likely the culprit in our little murder mystery, or at least, is working with the one responsible.~|~translationMissing
But it didn't look like he could open the door. He must still only have half the crest.~|~translationMissing
And let us hope it stays that way. Now, I will stay here and guard the door in case your friend returns. Go and tell Hazeel what happened. Now.~|~translationMissing
A 'please' wouldn't do any harm.~|~translationMissing
'Please' shut up and go.~|~translationMissing
Why are you here? Go and tell Hazeel what happened. Now.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'm going.~|~translationMissing
Where is Khazard?~|~translationMissing
He's back there. There's been a development.~|~translationMissing
We found the door to the prison, and we found someone trying to open it.~|~translationMissing
Someone?~|~translationMissing
An assassin. I've encountered them before, but I don't really know anything about them.~|~translationMissing
And the crest?~|~translationMissing
It seems they still only have half of it.~|~translationMissing
Curious. Why would they come here with only half the crest?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps they didn't know they'd need the other half?~|~translationMissing
Possible, but unlikely. It should be clear to anyone that both halves are needed. I wonder...~|~translationMissing
As I mentioned earlier, the other half was held by one of my kin. My kind have the ability to sense each other, but we have not felt his presence for a long time now.~|~translationMissing
So he's dead?~|~translationMissing
That was my initial assumption, but it is unusual that we have not felt his passing either. It's possible he is masking his presence instead.~|~translationMissing
It's no easy feat, but it can be done. As fate would have it, we stand in a place where our senses mean nothing.~|~translationMissing
So you think he's nearby?~|~translationMissing
While foolish to do so, he would have good reason to hide himself in this area.~|~translationMissing
So the other half might be closer than we think. What do we do?~|~translationMissing
This assassin must be found. I will remain here and ensure no one enters or leaves. You will search the rest of this dungeon and see what you can find.~|~translationMissing
Why would this other Mahjarrat hide himself here?~|~translationMissing
Our rejuvenation ritual takes place right above us. There have been times in the past when the weaker of our number have tried to hide themselves nearby.~|~translationMissing
To claim power from the ritual without the risk of being chosen as the sacrifice.~|~translationMissing
So I'm guessing this other Mahjarrat is quite a weak one then?~|~translationMissing
You are correct. When the Empty Lord fell, he was one of the few foolish enough to remain loyal. His decision not to join Lord Zamorak left him with few friends. He has slowly grown weak ever since.~|~translationMissing
What's inside the prison that the assassin would want?~|~translationMissing
The prison was sealed long ago by two of my traitorous kin. They did so to prevent a great horror from escaping, but it is believed by some that a powerful artefact was also sealed inside.~|~translationMissing
And the assassin wants this artefact?~|~translationMissing
Most likely. However, his attempts to claim it will risk unleashing what lies within.~|~translationMissing
Which you consider to be a problem?~|~translationMissing
In an ideal world, I would see this artefact claimed in the name of Zamorak. But to risk unleashing an abomination of the Fallen Empire when the ritual is so close would not be wise.~|~translationMissing
What's the history between you and Khazard?~|~translationMissing
That is none of your business. I have been generous enough to share a great deal of information with you so far, but I will not allow you to pry into personal matters.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Could you at least tell him to leave me alone? I feel like every time I turn my back, he's going to put his sword through it.~|~translationMissing
And have I not already been stopping him from doing so? Besides, his anger is not without cause. You wronged him, did you not?~|~translationMissing
In my defence, he was doing some pretty nasty things. Not to mention, I also wronged you and you're not trying to have me killed constantly.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but you would be wise not to mistake my mercy for weakness. I am willing to forgive you for your past transgressions as I believe you can be of use.~|~translationMissing
However, if I come to regret my choice, your fate will make the fires of Infernus seem welcoming in comparison.~|~translationMissing
In my defence, he was doing some pretty nasty things.~|~translationMissing
If you do not have the stomach for certain... unpleasantries, you should not have allied yourself with me, either.~|~translationMissing
You seem more reasonable than Khazard, though.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps, but I trust you do not mistake that for weakness. If you wrong me, your fate will make the fires of Infernus seem welcoming in comparison.~|~translationMissing
I wanted to ask you something.~|~translationMissing
No. I assume Hazeel has given you a job to do? Go get it done and leave me in peace.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer, have you found the assassin?~|~translationMissing
No, but I have found something... It's sort of hard to explain. I think I need to get back there.~|~translationMissing
Then go at once.~|~translationMissing
Aargh... Muspah! Wait... What...?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... just another nightmare.~|~translationMissing
Just a nightmare? That feels like a bit of an understatement.~|~translationMissing
What is this? A human?~|~translationMissing
Who are you, human? Speak now, and do so with haste, for you stand before the mighty Jhallan!~|~translationMissing
Well I'm [player name], and I'm guessing you're the Mahjarrat I'm looking for.~|~translationMissing
A human, seeking a Mahjarrat? Why? What would a meaningless being like you want with me?~|~translationMissing
You have half a crest, right? There's an assassin who's after it. I'm trying to stop him.~|~translationMissing
You know of the Ghorrock Crest? How?~|~translationMissing
A story of lies, no doubt. I don't know how you came to stand before me, human, but you are clearly no friend of mine. Leave now, before I bring down the might of the Ruinous Powers on you!~|~translationMissing
Wait! It's true! This assassin is nearby. He'll be coming for you!~|~translationMissing
Then let him come! I am a faithful servant of the Empty Lord. I will not be intimidated by a pathetic human like you.~|~translationMissing
The assassin appears.~|~translationMissing
And who are you?~|~translationMissing
You!~|~translationMissing
The assassin casts a spell and teleports him and Jhallan away.~|~translationMissing
Oh, this is not good...~|~translationMissing
The player runs to Khazard back at the strange barrier.~|~translationMissing
Khazard... we have a big problem!~|~translationMissing
What have you done now?~|~translationMissing
I found Jhallan, but the assassin captured him!~|~translationMissing
Jhallan was here? Great. Hazeel!~|~translationMissing
The assassin captured Jhallan!~|~translationMissing
Then he now has everything he needs to enter the prison.~|~translationMissing
What's our next...~|~translationMissing
Hang on...~|~translationMissing
The strange barrier disappears.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand. I didn't even see anything.~|~translationMissing
It seems your friend has quite the range of abilities. He used the Shadow Realm.~|~translationMissing
So he got inside? Do we follow him?~|~translationMissing
No good will come out of going in there. We have failed.~|~translationMissing
So we're not going to do anything?~|~translationMissing
Guards will need positioning here to warn us if this assassin remerges. Until then, we can only hope that he meets a swift end in the prison.~|~translationMissing
I can have a detachment of soldiers despatched here at once. We'll need to keep things light to ensure the trolls don't notice our work. Not to mention our kin...~|~translationMissing
What about Jhallan?~|~translationMissing
Still a prisoner of this assassin, no doubt. To what end, who can say.~|~translationMissing
Is there really nothing else we can do?~|~translationMissing
No. Word will be sent to you if there are any developments, but for now, you should leave. I suggest you return to the authorities in Ardougne and inform them that their killer will not be found.~|~translationMissing
But there's still so many unanswered questions!~|~translationMissing
And perhaps one day they will be answered, but to dwell on them now achieves nothing.~|~translationMissing
We should get to work.~|~translationMissing
Agreed. Adventurer, we are done here. If you wish, I can provide you with a teleport to Ardougne.~|~translationMissing

I'll make my own way.~|~translationMissing
You're back. Any luck with your investigation?~|~translationMissing
I wish I had better news, but I'm afraid I reached a dead end.~|~translationMissing
Why? What happened?~|~translationMissing
The killer was an assassin. I don't know his true identity, but I previously encountered him on Entrana. He killed some monks there and stole an important relic.~|~translationMissing
An assassin? Why would an assassin want Sir Ceril dead?~|~translationMissing
Quite a bit is still unclear, but it seems he cared less about killing Ceril and more about recovering something hidden in the mansion.~|~translationMissing
Where is this assassin now?~|~translationMissing
Somewhere we have no hope of reaching him. Hopefully that changes, but for now, there's not much we can do.~|~translationMissing
Well I guess I'd better go and file my report on all this. My superiors aren't going to be happy.~|~translationMissing
Still, thank you for all your help. Even though we weren't successful, I very much appreciate you trying. If you discover anything new about this assassin, do let me know.~|~translationMissing
Well I guess I'd better go and file my report on all this. My superiors aren't going to be happy. First the Jones situation, now this.~|~translationMissing
Jones situation?~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course, you don't know. Jones was found dead in his cell. Poison by the looks of it.~|~translationMissing
Yes, quite the mess. Assumption is the cult are to blame. Tying up loose ends and all that.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, thank you for all your help. Even though we weren't successful, I still very much appreciate it. If you discover anythiing new about this assassin, do let me know.~|~translationMissing
I'll let you be on your way. All the best out there.~|~translationMissing

You find an interesting looking book on the shelf.~|~translationMissing
You find nothing useful here.~|~translationMissing
You find a selection of herbs.~|~translationMissing
You search the table but find nothing.~|~translationMissing
Start the Shades of Mort'ton quest?~|~translationMissing
(Diary book interface. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
You make serum 207.~|~translationMissing
Ulsquire Shauncy~|~translationMissing
Ah, excellent, you've made your own serum and it seems to work well! Many thanks for using the Serum on me! But beware, I may start to change back soon!~|~translationMissing
My name is Ulsquire Shauncy, I'm the local teacher and priest around here. You've really come at a time when  Mort'ton is in a terrible state.~|~translationMissing
The emanations from the rest of Morytania affect the people here terribly turning them into mindless creatures. And, as if that wasn't enough, we get picked off by the evil Shades that exist in this area.~|~translationMissing
Wow, you guys seem to be really at the bottom of the food chain around here.~|~translationMissing
This sad and afflicted little town is called 'Mort'ton'. In it's heyday it was a busy and bustling market town with a speciality for interring the dead.~|~translationMissing
The vile emanations from the Sanguinesti area started to spread and the town hasn't been the same since. The serum you made was the one that Herbi Flax was working on. Unfortunately the serum isn't permanent.~|~translationMissing
Do you know how I could make the serum permanent?~|~translationMissing
I remember Herbi Flax talking about the serum. He said it worked on what he called the 'biological' effects of the affliction but that some other secondary effect was at work which he didn't quite understand.~|~translationMissing
He was interested in 'Flaemtaer', the ruined temple to the North. I found this odd. A man of science studying a structure dedicated to faith and the struggle of good verus evil, another concept he didn't understand.~|~translationMissing
The people are affected by the emanations from  the rest of Morytania and the dead from the tombs  have manifested into shadow creatures.~|~translationMissing
What are all these shadowy creatures?~|~translationMissing
They are the disturbed spirits of those interred in the earth beneath Mort'ton. Their eternal spirits have been poisoned by the close vicinity to the evil nature of the inhabitants of the Sanguinesti area.~|~translationMissing
Is there anyone else worth talking to around here?~|~translationMissing
Well, there's my good friend Razmire Keelgan. He's a prominent shop owner in Mort'ton, at least he was before he was affected by the area.~|~translationMissing
I know he tried to gather the militia together to fight the shades. He might know something about the temple. Razmire lives in the building to the west just over there, go and talk to him.~|~translationMissing
Ah, hello again, what can I do for you now?~|~translationMissing
My name is Razmire Keelgan, I run a couple of shops in Mort'ton but don't get much custom these days.~|~translationMissing
Which stores do you run?~|~translationMissing
I run a general store with a few useful items, and I have a building supplies store, I'm hoping that when things get better down here, people will want to buy items to repair their buildings.~|~translationMissing
Can I see your general store please~|~translationMissing
Well to be honest, all of my stock is packed away right now seeing as the town is all overrun with these Shades. I tell you what. You put an end to five Shades for me and I'll open the store for you!~|~translationMissing
I have details on that dilapidated temple to the North. These shades have a purpose - they jealously guard their burial treasure! If you can do me some favours, I could help you to locate it!~|~translationMissing
Kill five Shades?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll dispatch those dark and evil creatures.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, not right now, I need to do something else first.~|~translationMissing
Can I see your build supplies store please~|~translationMissing
I have other questions for you.~|~translationMissing
This place is called Mort'ton, it used to be a quiet town with a specialism in death. That is to say that many burial tombs were created here in the naturally formed caves under this very village.~|~translationMissing
Well, the people of the village, my usual customers... are all affected by the emanations from some place to the North East. Ulsquire can give you the name.~|~translationMissing
Needless to say Herbi was working on a serum to help us and you stumbled across the recipe! I for one am grateful to you, but there's a lot left to do before Mort'ton is returned to it's former glory.~|~translationMissing
Those disgusting entities are the filth that have ruined my life. They're the restless spirits of the dead who jealously guard their burial treasure yet feed on the  life force of the living.~|~translationMissing
I've heard that they jealously guard their tomb treasure and that it's worth plundering. I need you to kill five shades and bring me their remains so that I can conduct some experiments. Will you do it?~|~translationMissing
Great, that's what I wanted to hear. When you've done it, bring back all the remains,  I want to inspect them.~|~translationMissing
Ok, fair enough...~|~translationMissing
Is there anything worth doing around here?~|~translationMissing
Life is a daily struggle with those Shades around here. They attack when you least expect it...it's terrifying! I tell you what, if you kill five of those Shades I'll see if I can help you out! Is it a deal?~|~translationMissing
Hey, have you killed the five shades yet?~|~translationMissing
No not yet!~|~translationMissing
Come back then when you have. And remember to bring me the remains, Ulsquire seems to think we might be able to send these poor souls to a better place.~|~translationMissing
How's it going? I talked to Razmire and he's asked  me to slay five shades.~|~translationMissing
I can't say that I'm surprised, Razmire hates them, but it would be interesting to see the remains of one and investigate it somehow. I might find something useful!~|~translationMissing
(If the player has chose one of the above options in this conversation) Is there anyone else worth talking to around here?~|~translationMissing
Ok, thanks~|~translationMissing
Ok, thanks[sic]~|~translationMissing
That's one Shade!~|~translationMissing
Have you killed those Shades yet?~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, not yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, come back when you have.~|~translationMissing
That's two Shades!~|~translationMissing
That's three Shades!~|~translationMissing
That's four Shades!~|~translationMissing
That's all five Shades!~|~translationMissing
Yes I have actually!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, yes, but you don't have the  five shade remains I asked of you! Come back when you have them.~|~translationMissing
Razmire takes two Shade remains.~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll experiment on these! I think that Ulsquire might be keen to see some shade remains, if you take some over to him, he can possibly give you some extra information about them.~|~translationMissing
Now that you've slayed some of those nasty shades,  I feel motivated to help you out, I can trade with you now if you like.~|~translationMissing
(Razmire General Store. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
(Razmire Builders Merchants. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
What do you know out[sic] about the shades?~|~translationMissing
What do you know about the shades?~|~translationMissing
Ulsqire says they're the incarnation of the dead who were interred in the tombs under Mort'ton. If you can find a way to put these spirits to rest, I'll show you a way into their lair!~|~translationMissing
Mind you...there must be thousands of them buried under there! Just imagine all the treasure they  must have buried under there!~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about that temple?~|~translationMissing
It's ancient and has been desecrated since before I was born. I've always felt that it was quite a nice place to sit and have a picnic, quite a nice view out of the swamps of Mort Myre.~|~translationMissing
I told Ulsquire that if he can afford to go half's  with me on the building materials, I'd help him to  try and fix it up one day. I've always wondered  what it looked like back in pagan times.~|~translationMissing
Do you know how I could make this serum permanent?~|~translationMissing
I'd say not my friend. That clever Flax chap was always experimentatin', I guess he was a scholarly type. He always dismissed Ulsquires learned speculations about the temple, I'd say that was a bit short sighted myself.~|~translationMissing
Well, you made the serum yourself so I guess you'll experimentate with it. I'd say that the temple might be able to change the serum in some way. Well, yes, I guess it sounds superstitious, but what's to be lost?~|~translationMissing
Can you open a store for me?~|~translationMissing
Sure, which store do you wanna see?~|~translationMissing
Razmire said to come and talk to you.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, well, that's very nice.~|~translationMissing
I just slayed five shades for Razmire...he said that  you might be interested in seeing the shade remains.  Unfortunately I don't have any with me at the moment...~|~translationMissing
That is a shame, I would have liked to have seen the remains. Razmire was right. I'm keen to study them  and perhaps see if I can work out a way to put  their spirits to rest.~|~translationMissing
I just slayed 5 shades for Razmire, he said you  might be interested in seeing some shade remains?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, that would be interesting!~|~translationMissing
You show the shade remains to the priest. He wanders off to study the bones.~|~translationMissing
What did you find out about the remains?~|~translationMissing
What did you find out about the remains.~|~translationMissing
The shade remains are made of a strange substance  which I've not come across before. I believe we should put these tormented spirits to rest.~|~translationMissing
How can we do that? You can't even bury the remains!~|~translationMissing
Quite right...I was thinking that a holy cremation would do the trick, but the funeral pyres need specially prepared 'pyre logs' - normal logs that have been  treated with 'sacred oil' to give it a nice holy touch.~|~translationMissing
How would I make some sacred oil?~|~translationMissing
You won't! It's a pagan secret lost a long time ago. Normally I would try to bless some commonly found vegetable oil, but I'm so weak from this illness that I know I just won't be able to do it.~|~translationMissing
Huh! I used to joke with Herbi Flax that if 'Flaemtaer temple' was still standing, we could practice some ancient pagan rituals and incite the sacred flame! Huh, I'm not surprised that he never took me seriously!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, interesting question. It is an ancient pagan  temple referred to as Flaemtaer. I've studied it quite  a lot, one day I hope to be able to rebuild it, who knows what ancient power it could unleash?~|~translationMissing
How can you rebuild a totally destroyed temple?~|~translationMissing
I couldn't do it alone, I'd need a few expert artisans to help with the construction. I'd also need a good supply of limestone bricks, swamp paste and timber beams. Thankfully Razmire stocks all these items. (Sigh)~|~translationMissing
The serum is a product of science. Herbi was a clever man to have made it, but he didn't integrate anything from the spiritual world into his work - and for all of his hard science there is still something missing.~|~translationMissing
So, you don't know then!~|~translationMissing
I'm a man of faith...that's all I know. Sometimes I feel that we should experiment with the sacred and the holy, not just the crude matter we find around us everyday.~|~translationMissing
That's up to you my friend! I once heard someone say that making your own decisions is the only real freedom you have. Exercise your freedom my friend,  while you still can.~|~translationMissing
The holy fire altar appears sanctified, it can now be lit!~|~translationMissing
You are now allowed to light the holy fire altar.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I've started repairing the temple.~|~translationMissing
That's great, carry on the good work. I'm sure that the temple is the key to unlocking  a better life for all of us in Mort'ton.~|~translationMissing
What should I do when the temple is built?~|~translationMissing
I've researched this much, it seems that the temple was dedicated to the worship of elemental flame or fire. The sacred flame was said to be very holy and was used somehow to sanctify oil for use in cremations.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not already received olive oil~|~translationMissing
The pagans believed that sacred oil sanctified the cremation ceremony and thus helped the deceased pass  onto the next life, and it helped the logs to burn! In case there's any truth in the story, have this!~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- tbox edit)~|~translationMissing
If the player has received olive oil already~|~translationMissing
The pagans believed that sacred oil sanctified the cremation ceremony and thus helped the deceased pass  onto the next life, and it helped the logs to burn! You can buy olive oil from Razmire, it's quite cheap.~|~translationMissing
The Shades keep knocking the temple down!~|~translationMissing
I'm not surprised. The temple represents holiness. They may feel that it has power over them in some way. My advice is to carry on and finish the temple if you can, and see what happens. You may need help though!~|~translationMissing
You may need help building the temple or defending yourself against the Shades. I'm sure if you ask around nicely you would be able to get some help.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more about the Shades.~|~translationMissing
All undead hate mortal spirituality. It's a symbol of mortal hope in the face of death and the unknown. The temple represents the finality of true death where all ties to the mortal world are lost.~|~translationMissing
The Shades wish to forever possess the value of their tomb treasures and jealously guard them in death as they did in life. They are afraid of true death and so try to destroy anything which reminds them of it.~|~translationMissing
I keep running out of building materials!~|~translationMissing
I'd go and see Razmire, perhaps he has some items in stock?~|~translationMissing
That's great, carry on the good work.~|~translationMissing
Well, you could always have a nice picnic... oh.. but then there's the problem with the Shades... hmmm,  not nice... not nice at all! Well, I'll be honest, I  don't really know! But I bet Ulsquire will know.~|~translationMissing
Interesting...perhaps they have something against the temple? Perhaps it represents something bad to them? Hmm, interesting stuff, but you'd best speak to Ulsquire about that sort of thing... do you need any supplies?~|~translationMissing
Oh really... that's interesting... I have just the thing for you!~|~translationMissing
You carefully sanctify the oil in the sacred flame.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I used the olive oil on the flame and it gave me sacred oil! What should I do now?~|~translationMissing
From what I've learned, the ancients used to use the  sacred oil on logs in order to make pyre logs for cremation. You could try that!~|~translationMissing
You use the sacred oil on the logs and get pyre logs.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I used the sacred oil on the logs and I made pyre logs! What should I do now?~|~translationMissing
Now you need to place the sacred logs on the pyre, then add the remains of a shade, then set fire to the pyre. This should release the Shade from it's eternal damnation and help it pass on to the other side.~|~translationMissing
You put some logs on the pyre.~|~translationMissing
I've placed the logs on the pyre. What do I do now?~|~translationMissing
You need to place the remains of the shade on top  of the logs and then set alight to it.~|~translationMissing
You place the shade's remains on the logs.~|~translationMissing
A reward appears on the stand~|~translationMissing
Hey, I've laid a Shade to rest, can you  tell me where the Shade lair is now?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, great job on putting that Shade to rest. The entrance to the Shade Lair is due North of my shop. Good hunting in the lair my friend!~|~translationMissing
I've put the Shade's spirit to rest!~|~translationMissing
Great! Well done my friend!~|~translationMissing

3.1 Talking to Councillor Halgrive after burning all bones~|~translationMissing
Hello. How are you?~|~translationMissing
Councillor Halgrive~|~translationMissing
You may or may not be aware, but a plague has spread across West Ardougne. Now, so far, our efforts to contain it have been largely successful, for the most part.~|~translationMissing
However, some sheep recently escaped from a farm near the city. When they were found, we noticed that they were strangely discoloured, so we asked the mourners to examine them.~|~translationMissing
They believe that the sheep have become infected with the plague.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure it's the plague?~|~translationMissing
Well the mourners seemed convinced and they're the experts. Even if it's not though, the sheep are clearly diseased in some way.~|~translationMissing
As the councillor responsible for public health and safety here in East Ardougne, I am in charge of dealing with this problem.~|~translationMissing
We need someone to herd these sheep into a safe enclosure, kill them quickly and cleanly and then dispose of the remains hygienically in a special incinerator.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, nobody wants to risk catching the plague, and I am unable to find someone willing to undertake this mission for me.~|~translationMissing
Start the Sheep Herder quest?~|~translationMissing
I can do that for you.~|~translationMissing
Before you will be allowed to enter the enclosure, however, you must ensure you have some kind of protective clothing to prevent contagion.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find some protective clothing then?~|~translationMissing
Doctor Orbon should have something suitable. You should be able to find him in the chapel just north of here.~|~translationMissing
The councillor gives you some poisoned sheep feed.~|~translationMissing
How will I know which sheep are infected?~|~translationMissing
The poor creatures have developed strangely discoloured wool and flesh. You should have no trouble spotting them. There should be four in total.~|~translationMissing
That's not a job for me.~|~translationMissing
That's what concerns me... There might not be much life around here soon.~|~translationMissing
Please... please find and dispose of those four diseased sheep as quickly as possible. Every second the risk of contamination grows! If you need some protective clothing, speak to Doctor Orbon in the chapel just north~|~translationMissing
of here.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the sheep feed~|~translationMissing
Some more sheep poison would be appreciated...~|~translationMissing
Certainly adventurer. Please hurry!~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the sheep feed~|~translationMissing
I'll do my best sir.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I've spoken to Councillor Halgrive. He has asked me to round up your sheep and slaughter them.~|~translationMissing
Farmer Brumty~|~translationMissing
Hello doctor. I need to acquire some protective clothing so that I can dispose of some diseased sheep.~|~translationMissing
Doctor Orbon~|~translationMissing
Protective clothing? I'm afraid I only have the one suit which I made myself to prevent infection from any contaminated patients I treat.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I could sell you this one and make myself another, but it would cost you at least 100 gold so that I could afford a replacement.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 100 coins~|~translationMissing
Oops, sorry, I don't have enough money.~|~translationMissing
That's okay. Just don't go near those sheep. When you can find the money come back here.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 100 coins and 2 free inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
You give Doctor Orbon 100 coins. He hands over a protective suit.~|~translationMissing
These should protect you from infection.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 100 coins but not 2 free inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to have enough room to hold the protective suit. Come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the 100 coins~|~translationMissing
Sorry doc, that's too much.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid it will cost me that much to replace. I cannot possibly sell it for less.~|~translationMissing
Did you dispose of those infected sheep yet?~|~translationMissing
You should hurry, they could infect the entire town in a matter of a few days!~|~translationMissing
If the player has the gear in their inventory~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the gear in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I notice you do not appear to have your protective clothing with you. Would you care to buy some more? Same price as before.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 100 coins~|~translationMissing
No, I don't need any more.~|~translationMissing
I suggest you go and retrieve your protective suit then. Trust me, you do not want to be infected.~|~translationMissing
Have you managed to find and dispose of those four sheep yet?~|~translationMissing
Uh... yeah... not quite just yet...~|~translationMissing
Not quite's not good enough. It is vital you catch, kill, and incinerate all four sheep as quickly as possible. Each second they are free, the risk of further contagion increases.~|~translationMissing
I suggest you use the cattleprod from the barn over there to herd them, that way you won't have to touch them directly and risk infection.~|~translationMissing
It doesn't look very safe in there. I'm not going in without decent protective clothing.~|~translationMissing
I don't think I should kill the sheep outside the enclosure. The councillor was worried that it might spread the disease.~|~translationMissing
The sheep looks extremely unwell. I don't want to touch it without a full protective suit.~|~translationMissing
[Colour] Sheep~|~translationMissing
BAAAAA!~|~translationMissing
The sheep obligingly jumps over the gate and into the enclosure!~|~translationMissing
There's already a sheep like this in the pen. You don't need to fetch another one now.~|~translationMissing
The sheep is already in the enclosure. You don't need to prod it.~|~translationMissing
You feed some poisoned sheep food to the sheep. It happily eats it.~|~translationMissing
You watch as the sheep collapses dead onto the floor.~|~translationMissing
The sheep isn't going to drink the poison from the bottle. Perhaps you should try feeding it something else more appropriate.~|~translationMissing
You put the remains into the furnace.~|~translationMissing
The remains burn to dust.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work adventurer! Please let me reimburse you the 100 gold it cost you to purchase your protective clothing.~|~translationMissing
And in recognition of your service to the public health of Ardougne, please accept this further 3000 coins as a reward.~|~translationMissing

What are you doing on my land? You're not the one who keeps leaving all my gates open and letting out all my sheep, are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a quest.~|~translationMissing
You're after a quest, you say? Actually, I could do with a bit of help.~|~translationMissing
My sheep are getting mighty woolly. I'd be much obliged if you could shear them. And while you're at it, spin the wool for me too.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's it. Bring me 20 balls of wool. And I'm sure I could sort out some sort of payment. Of course, there's the small matter of The Thing.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has 20 balls of wool in their inventory~|~translationMissing
In fact Fred, funnily enough, I actually have 20 balls of wool already on me.~|~translationMissing
Have you been shearing my sheep without permission!?~|~translationMissing
No! Well, maybe... They just looked a little wooly! Surely you like a shave once in a while, too?~|~translationMissing
It's rude to shave another person without permission - don't be coming at me with them shears!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I'll ask permission next time.~|~translationMissing
I guess no real 'arm was done. Hand the balls over and we can put this whole thing behind us.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean, The Thing?~|~translationMissing
Well now, no one has ever seen The Thing. That's why we call it The Thing, 'cos we don't know what it is.~|~translationMissing
Some say it's a black hearted shapeshifter, hungering for the souls of hard working decent folk like me. Others say it's just a sheep.~|~translationMissing
Well I don't have all day to stand around and gossip. Are you going to shear my sheep or what!~|~translationMissing
Sheep Shearer is started.~|~translationMissing
Yes, okay. I can do that.~|~translationMissing
Good! Now one more thing, do you actually know how to shear a sheep?~|~translationMissing
Err. No, I don't know actually.~|~translationMissing
Well, first things first, you need a pair of shears. I've got some here you can use.~|~translationMissing
You just need to go and use them on the sheep out in my field.~|~translationMissing
Sounds easy!~|~translationMissing
That's what they all say!~|~translationMissing
Some of the sheep don't like it too much... Persistence is the key.~|~translationMissing
Once you've collected some wool you can spin it into balls.~|~translationMissing
Do you know how to spin wool?~|~translationMissing
I don't know how to spin wool, sorry.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, it's quite simple!~|~translationMissing
The nearest Spinning Wheel can be found on the first floor of Lumbridge Castle.~|~translationMissing
To get to Lumbridge Castle just follow the road east.~|~translationMissing
This icon denotes a Spinning Wheel on the world map.~|~translationMissing
No, I'll give it a miss.~|~translationMissing
Suit yourself.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for something to kill.~|~translationMissing
What, on my land? Leave my livestock alone you scoundrel!~|~translationMissing
I'm lost.~|~translationMissing
How can you be lost? Just follow the road east and south. You'll end up in Lumbridge fairly quickly.~|~translationMissing
I need to talk to you about shearing these sheep!~|~translationMissing
Oh. How are you doing getting those balls of wool?~|~translationMissing
How many more do I need to give you?~|~translationMissing
You need to collect 20 more balls of wool.~|~translationMissing
Ah well at least you haven't been eaten. You know what you're doing, right?~|~translationMissing
How do I shear sheep, again?~|~translationMissing
If the player has shears~|~translationMissing
Well, you're half way there already! You have a set of shears in your inventory. Just use those on a Sheep to shear it.~|~translationMissing
That's all I have to do?~|~translationMissing
Well once you've collected some wool you'll need to spin it into balls.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have shears~|~translationMissing
Yes, I know how to spin wool.~|~translationMissing
Remind me how to spin wool.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I think so.~|~translationMissing
You can get to it, then!~|~translationMissing
I've got some wool. I've not managed to make it into a ball though.~|~translationMissing
Well go find a spinning wheel then. You can find one on the first floor of Lumbridge Castle, just walk east on the road outside my house and you'll find Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
The... whatever it is... manages to get away from you!~|~translationMissing
I have some.~|~translationMissing
You give Fred [1-19] [ball/balls] of wool.~|~translationMissing
That's all I've got so far.~|~translationMissing
I need [1-19] more before I can pay you.~|~translationMissing
Ok I'll work on it.~|~translationMissing
I need [#] more before I can pay you.~|~translationMissing
Fred! Fred! I've seen The Thing!~|~translationMissing
You ... you actually saw it?~|~translationMissing
Run for the hills! [player name] grab as many chickens as you can! We have to ...~|~translationMissing
Fred!~|~translationMissing
... flee! Oh, woe is me! The shapeshifter is coming! We're all ...~|~translationMissing
FRED!~|~translationMissing
... doomed. What!~|~translationMissing
It's not a shapeshifter or any other kind of monster!~|~translationMissing
Well then what is it [boy/girl]?~|~translationMissing
Have you been out in the sun too long?~|~translationMissing
That's the last of them.~|~translationMissing
I guess I'd better pay you then.~|~translationMissing

Mosol seems to be looking around very cautiously. He jumps a little when you approach and talk to him.~|~translationMissing
Mosol Rei~|~translationMissing
Run! Run for your life! Save yourself! I'll keep them back as long as I can...~|~translationMissing
Why do I need to run?~|~translationMissing
Your very life is in danger. Rashiliyia has returned and we are all doomed.~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia? Who is she?~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia is the Queen of the dead. She has returned and has brought a plague of undead with her. They now occupy our village and we have them trapped. I warn people like yourself to stay away.~|~translationMissing
What can we do?~|~translationMissing
We're doing all we can to keep the undead at bay. The village is covered in a deadly green mist. If you go into the village, a terrible sickness will befall you.~|~translationMissing
And the undead are even stronger beyond the gates. My guess is that it has something to do with the Legend of Rashiliyia.~|~translationMissing
But you would need to talk to the Shaman in Tai Bwo Wannai village to get more details about that. I really have to go now and fight these undead.~|~translationMissing
Why are the undead here?~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia! The Queen of the undead has risen! She is the mother of the undead creatures that roam this land. But alas I know nothing of the legend that surrounds her.~|~translationMissing
Legend you say?~|~translationMissing
Yes.... I said it is a legend that I know nothing about.~|~translationMissing
Oh, ok, sorry for bothering you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, Ok, sorry for bothering you.~|~translationMissing
Ok, perhaps you'd like to be on your way now?~|~translationMissing
Oh come on, you must know something.~|~translationMissing
Oh come on, you must know something?~|~translationMissing
Mosol lowers his head in deep concentration.~|~translationMissing
Well, let me think now...~|~translationMissing
He scratches his head...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, there was something I think that might help...~|~translationMissing
Mosol strains to remember something...~|~translationMissing
Nope, sorry. It's gone.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you know someone who does know something?~|~translationMissing
My guess is that this has something to do with the legend of Rashiliyia. But you need to speak to the Shaman in 'Tai Bwo Wannai' village to get more details about that.~|~translationMissing
I really have to fight these undead now Bwana, before they take over the world!~|~translationMissing
I'll go to see the Shaman.~|~translationMissing
Well, that would be helpful Bwana. If you're sure you want to go, you can take a Wampum belt to him for me. It will give the Shaman, Trufitus the story of our problems down here. Are you sure you want to go?~|~translationMissing
Errr, I'm having second thoughts now.~|~translationMissing
That's Ok Bwana, it's a big responsibility. Come back and see me if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm sure and I'll take the Wampum belt to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
I would be very grateful if you did. Here take this...~|~translationMissing
Mosol gives you a Wampum belt.~|~translationMissing
Player receives the Wampum belt, or it drops to the floor if the player has no inventory space.~|~translationMissing
Please can you give it to Trufitus. He may be able to give you extra details on the legend surrounding Rashiliyia. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
Ok. Thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
You're welcome Bwana, good luck.~|~translationMissing
I don't think this is something I can help with at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I don't think this is something that I can help with at the moment!~|~translationMissing
Ok, I understand Bwana! You may as well be on your way then.~|~translationMissing
Can I help in any way?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so Bwana, but you may want to consult with Trufitus the Shaman in Tai Bwo Wannai village, he may have some information which could help.~|~translationMissing
Uh, it sounds nasty, just the kind of thing I want to avoid.~|~translationMissing
Uh, it sounds nasty, just the kind of thing I want to avoid!~|~translationMissing
Quite right, Bwana, please make all haste! Before your spine turns to water as we speak.~|~translationMissing
What danger is there around here?~|~translationMissing
Can you not see Bwana? This whole area is infested with the living dead.~|~translationMissing
Two undead ones appear~|~translationMissing
Arrggghhh, here are some now!~|~translationMissing
Undead one~|~translationMissing
Rahhhhh! OOoohhhhhh!~|~translationMissing
Prepare to go to the other side!~|~translationMissing
Yeah... Ok, I'm running!~|~translationMissing
God speed to you my friend.~|~translationMissing
I am Mosol Rei, I am a Jungle Warrior. I used to live in this village, but it is too dangerous for you to stay around here.~|~translationMissing
Mosol Rei, that's a nice name.~|~translationMissing
Mosol looks at you and shakes his head in bewilderment.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, but you really should leave.~|~translationMissing
Well, if you go to see the Shaman, please give him that Wampum belt I gave to you, it will give him more details about our situation down here.~|~translationMissing
That's great Bwana, if you give Trufitus the Wampum belt I gave you, it will give him more details of our current situation.~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the Wampum belt, he studies it for a long time.~|~translationMissing
Hello Bwana, this message from Mosol Rei bears bad news... Yes, things do look very bad indeed.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about Rashiliyia?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, it's been a long time since I heard that name. Rashiliyia is the Queen of the Undead. And a more fearsome enemy you will be unlikely to find.~|~translationMissing
I fear that you bring me news that she has returned to plague us once again? Alas I know of no weakness that she has.~|~translationMissing
So there is nothing we can do?~|~translationMissing
Not that I can think of.~|~translationMissing
Oh, ok!~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's a bit sad really, I liked that village.~|~translationMissing
Trufitus seems deeply touched...~|~translationMissing
Well, I hope you will excuse me, but I need to get back to my studies.~|~translationMissing
Should I start to evacuate the Island?~|~translationMissing
Should I start to evacuate the island?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that may be a good idea. Many people could die! If only there was a way to defeat her!~|~translationMissing
Mosol Rei said something about a legend?~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes, there is a legend, but it is lost in the midst of antiquity...~|~translationMissing
The last place to hold any details regarding this mystery was in the temple of Ah Za Rhoon....and that has long since vanished... it crumbled into dust...~|~translationMissing
Why was it called Ah Za Rhoon?~|~translationMissing
It is from an ancient language. The direct translation is... 'Magnificence floating on water'. But my research makes me believe that the temple was built on land.~|~translationMissing
And most likely between large bodies of water, for example large lakes. However, many people have searched for the temple, and have failed. I would hate to see you waste your time on a pointless search like that.~|~translationMissing
About Ah Za Rhoon and where it is.~|~translationMissing
Trufitus looks at you blankly...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well, you are welcome bwana.~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything more about the temple?~|~translationMissing
Not much... I would say that is about it...~|~translationMissing
Even the great priest Zadimus who built the temple did not survive. Some say that Rashiliyia caused the temple to collapse.~|~translationMissing
She was angry at Zadimus for not returning her affections. She was a great sorceress even before they met.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more.~|~translationMissing
I don't know anymore. You're very demanding aren't you!~|~translationMissing
I am going to search for Ah Za Rhoon!~|~translationMissing
What?! You must be crazy! That place has passed into myth and legend, it has been buried under rubble for years. It's most likely buried 20 men deep, and that's if you can actually find it.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you're going to go and look for it? I may be able to do some research into this if you agree. Only I don't want to waste my time if you're not serious about this!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all the requirements and has a combat level below 45~|~translationMissing
Start the Shilo Village quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I will seriously look for Ah Za Rhoon and I'd appreciate your help.~|~translationMissing
Ok then Bwana, good luck with your quest, and remember to stock up well with adventuring supplies before setting off. You never know how useful some fairly ordinary things might be when you're~|~translationMissing
adventuring.~|~translationMissing
I'll hold on to this Wampum belt for you for the time being. I'll give it back to you when we have completed this quest.~|~translationMissing
Actually, now it comes to it, I'm having second thoughts.~|~translationMissing
Well, I understand. Perhaps you can search for it another time? Come back when you think you're ready. Excuse me now won't you while I return to my studies.~|~translationMissing
It's a pity that I can't search for Ah Za Rhoon now.~|~translationMissing
Are there any traps there?~|~translationMissing
How am I supposed to know? A lot of what I know is most probably wrong but some of it seems right to me. Excuse me but I must get back to my studies.~|~translationMissing
Will you pack your things now?~|~translationMissing
I will wait and see what will happen. Maybe Rashiliyia does not have the power to strike too far from her resting place? But there are many things that I need to do now.~|~translationMissing
Is her resting place important?~|~translationMissing
I believe it is! It might be that her physical remains are the focal point of her supernatural powers. It is said that many years ago, a group of adventurers once infiltrated her tomb to try to rid the world of Rashiliyia.~|~translationMissing
These adventurers reported seeing a wraith- like creature.~|~translationMissing
Although the adventurers disturbed Rashiliyia's bones, they were not able to properly sanctify them. And this is the most likely reason why she still plagues us today.~|~translationMissing
Of course, she only has to order one of her minions to move her bones and she can quite quickly and easily set up a new headquarters anywhere and continue to launch her plague of undead.~|~translationMissing
What are minions?~|~translationMissing
Minions are the fiendish undead creatures that she controls. She has very few living worshippers, but they need to be dealt with at some point.~|~translationMissing
Does she have any weaknesses?~|~translationMissing
I am not sure, but the legend about her certainly is long. It's a pity that the temple of Ah Za Rhoon has crumbled as there may be some clues that could help us to defeat her.~|~translationMissing
I think the largest problem will be in locating her resting place.~|~translationMissing
What are onions?~|~translationMissing
Surely you mean Minions?~|~translationMissing
Yes of course, I mean Minions, what made you think I said Onions?~|~translationMissing
Trufitus frowns at you but continues about...minions...~|~translationMissing
Minions are the fiendish undead creatures that Rashiliyia controls. She has very few living worshippers, but they need to be dealt with at some point.~|~translationMissing
Usually a strong creature of some sort will be guarding the bones and it is not to be tackled lightly.~|~translationMissing
Hello Bwana, how goes your quest to find Ah Za Rhoon?~|~translationMissing
Well thanks...~|~translationMissing
Well that's very good news. Let me know if you find anything useful, I may be able to help out.~|~translationMissing
Erm, I don't know where to look?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that doesn't surprise me. The only information I have refers to its name. Ah Za Rhoon, its name means 'Magnificence Floating on Water'.~|~translationMissing
Do you think it was floating on water?~|~translationMissing
It's very doubtful. I suspect it was built to 'appear' as if it was floating on water. Perhaps on an island or between large bodies of water.~|~translationMissing
If you search for somewhere like this, you may find something worth investigating.~|~translationMissing
Ok thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
You're welcome Bwana, I only hope it helped.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry Bwana but I just don't have a use for that!~|~translationMissing
It looks as if something is buried here.~|~translationMissing
It looks as if something is buried here. You may need some tools to excavate further.~|~translationMissing
You start digging...~|~translationMissing
You dig a small hole and almost immediately hit granite.~|~translationMissing
You excavate the hole a bit more...~|~translationMissing
And see that there is a small fissure...~|~translationMissing
You might just be able to crawl through it...~|~translationMissing
You have already excavated this area. Your spade clangs against the granite.~|~translationMissing
You see a small fissure in the granite that you might just be able to crawl through. Beyond the fissure is a long fall.~|~translationMissing
You see a small fissure in the granite that you might just be able to crawl through. Beyond the fissure is a long fall. Do you want to try to crawl through the fissure?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll give it a go!~|~translationMissing
It looks like there is a steep drop just after the fissure. It may be dangerous to try to climb down without any sort of support.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'm having second thoughts.~|~translationMissing
You think better of attempting to squeeze into the fissure.~|~translationMissing
It looks very dangerous, and dark... Scary!~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? You won't get that item back.~|~translationMissing
You drop the lit candle into the fissure and see that there is quite a large drop after you get through the hole. There is a good anchor point nearby onto which you could tie a rope.~|~translationMissing
The lit candle burns out.~|~translationMissing
You drop the lit black candle into the fissure and see that there is quite a large drop after you get through the hole. There is a good anchor point nearby onto which you could tie a rope.~|~translationMissing
The lit black candle burns out.~|~translationMissing
You see where to attach the rope very clearly. You secure the rope well.~|~translationMissing
You see a small fissure in the granite that you might just be able to crawl through. You can see that a rope is attached nearby.~|~translationMissing
You see a small fissure in the granite that you might just be able to crawl through. You can see that a rope is attached nearby, would you like to climb down?~|~translationMissing
Climb into the fissure?~|~translationMissing
You start to contort your body...~|~translationMissing
With some difficulty you manage to push yourself through the small crack in the rock.~|~translationMissing
You cleverly use the rope to slowly lower yourself to the floor.~|~translationMissing
The player enters Ah Za Rhoon~|~translationMissing
You see that there is a narrow gap through into the darkness. You could try to wriggle through and see where it takes you.~|~translationMissing
Wriggle through the rubble?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll wriggle through.~|~translationMissing
You manage to wriggle through the rubble.~|~translationMissing
No, I'll stay here.~|~translationMissing
You decide to stay where you are.~|~translationMissing
You can see that there is something hidden behind some rocks. Do you want to have a look? It looks a bit dangerous as the ceiling doesn't look at all safe.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll carefully move the rocks to see what's behind them.~|~translationMissing
You start to slowly move the rocks to one side.~|~translationMissing
You carefully manage to remove enough rocks to see a book shelf. You gingerly remove a delicate scroll from the shelf and place it in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
No, I'll leave them alone, I don't like the look of that ceiling.~|~translationMissing
You decide to leave the rocks well alone. The ceiling does look a little unsafe.~|~translationMissing
This looks like part of a scroll about someone called Bervirius. Would you like to read it?~|~translationMissing
Opens Transcript~|~translationMissing
Tattered scroll~|~translationMissing
You decide not to open the scroll. But instead place it carefully back in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
You find a tattered but very ornate scroll, which you place carefully in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
This looks like a scroll about Rashiliyia. Would you like to read it?~|~translationMissing
Crumpled scroll~|~translationMissing
You decide to leave the scroll well alone.~|~translationMissing
You take a look at the gallows. It's pretty eerie looking.~|~translationMissing
A grisly sight meets your eyes. A human corpse hangs from the noose. His hands have been tied behind his back.~|~translationMissing
You search the gallows...~|~translationMissing
You find a human corpse hanging in the noose. It looks as if the corpse can be removed easily. Would you like to remove the corpse from the noose?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so, it might animate and attack me!~|~translationMissing
You move away from the corpse quietly and slowly... ...you have an eerie feeling about this!~|~translationMissing
** Gulp! **~|~translationMissing
Yes, I may find something else on the corpse.~|~translationMissing
You gently support the frame of the skeleton and lift the skull through the noose.~|~translationMissing
You find an old sack and place the skeleton in it. Maybe Trufitus can give you some tips on what to do with it.~|~translationMissing
You sense that there is a spirit that needs to be put to rest.~|~translationMissing
This stone seems to have strange markings on it.~|~translationMissing
This stone seems to have strange markings on it. Maybe Trufitus can decipher them? THe stone is too heavy to carry but the letters stand proud on a plaque. Maybe you could seperate[sic] the plaque from the rock?~|~translationMissing
You cleanly cut the plaque of letters away from the rock. You place it carefully into your inventory.~|~translationMissing
The markings are very intricate. It's a very strange language. The meaning of it evades you though. Perhaps Trufitus can decipher the markings?~|~translationMissing
This table might be useful with some adjustment.~|~translationMissing
You may be able to turn this dilapidated table into something that could help you to get out of this place. What would you like to try and turn this table into?~|~translationMissing
A ladder~|~translationMissing
You happily start hacking away at the table but realise that you won't have enough wood to properly finish the item off!~|~translationMissing
Oops! Not enough wood left to do anything else with the table!~|~translationMissing
A crude raft~|~translationMissing
You see that this table already looks very sea worthy it takes virtually no time at all to help fix it into a crude raft.[sic]~|~translationMissing
You place it carefully on the water!~|~translationMissing
You board the raft!~|~translationMissing
You push off!~|~translationMissing
Weeeeeeee!~|~translationMissing
You come to a huge waterfall...~|~translationMissing
* Uh oh! *~|~translationMissing
...And plough through it!~|~translationMissing
The raft soon breaks up.~|~translationMissing
A pole vault~|~translationMissing
Your experience in crafting tells you that there isn't enough wood to complete this task.~|~translationMissing
There isn't enough wood left in this table to make anything!~|~translationMissing
There is a huge cascading waterfall in front of you, the roar of the water is quite loud. To the east you can see what looks like a trecherous[sic] pathway, it might lead outside.~|~translationMissing
You see a huge waterfall blocking your path. The path leads on through the cascading waterfall, but it looks quite dangerous. Would you like to try and follow the path?~|~translationMissing
Follow the path?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll follow the path.~|~translationMissing
You start carefully edging along the slippery path...~|~translationMissing
If the player succeeds~|~translationMissing
You climb your way out of the cavern into the heat of the Jungle.~|~translationMissing
If the player fails~|~translationMissing
You fall!~|~translationMissing
Arrgghhhh!~|~translationMissing
You're pumelled as the thrashing water throws~|~translationMissing
you against the rocks.~|~translationMissing
The player is dealt some damage.~|~translationMissing
No, I'll look for another exit.~|~translationMissing
You decide to have another look around. And see if you can find a better way to get out.~|~translationMissing
Greetings...~|~translationMissing
Greetings Bwana, you have been away! The situation with Rashiliyia is worsening! I pray that you have some good news for me.~|~translationMissing
I think I found the temple of Ah Za Rhoon.~|~translationMissing
Well that sounds great Bwana. Tell me, what did you find?~|~translationMissing
I need help with Bervirius.~|~translationMissing
Bervirius is the son of Rashiliyia. His tomb may hold some clues as to how Rashiliyia may be defeated.~|~translationMissing
I have some items that I need help with.~|~translationMissing
Well, just let me see the item and I'll help as much as I can.~|~translationMissing
We need to identify that the place you have found is indeed Ah Za Rhoon.~|~translationMissing
Any scrolls or information about Rashiliyia's kin would be helpful.~|~translationMissing
Have you got any items concerning Rashiliyia? If so, please show me them.~|~translationMissing
There must be something relating to Zadimus at the temple. Did you find anything? If so, let me see it.~|~translationMissing
And best of luck!~|~translationMissing
I need help with Zadimus.~|~translationMissing
Zadimus is a spirit yearning for freedom. Bury him in a sacred place to release his spirit.~|~translationMissing
Is there any sacred ground around here?~|~translationMissing
The ground in the centre of the village is very sacred to us. Maybe you could try there?~|~translationMissing
I need help with Rashliyia.~|~translationMissing
I need some help with the Temple of Ah Za Rhoon.~|~translationMissing
Ok, thanks!~|~translationMissing
You're quite welcome Bwana.~|~translationMissing
I need help with Rashiliyia.~|~translationMissing
We need to find Rashiliyia's resting place and learn how to put her spirit to rest. You may find some clues to her resting place in Ah Za Rhoon or Bervirius' Tomb.~|~translationMissing
If you have found the temple, you should search it thoroughly and see if there are any clues about Rashiliyia.~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the corpse.~|~translationMissing
What do you make of this?~|~translationMissing
?! GASP?! That's incredible, where did you find it?~|~translationMissing
I found the corpse in a decomposing gallows. I get a very strange feeling every time I try to bury the body.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, that sounds very strange. I sense a spirit in torment, you should try to bury the remains.~|~translationMissing
Can you dispose of this for me?~|~translationMissing
Trufitus pulls away from you...~|~translationMissing
I dare not touch it. I am a spiritual man and the spirit of this being may possess me and turn me into a minion of Rashiliyia.~|~translationMissing
Can you decipher this please?~|~translationMissing
This is an ancient artefact!~|~translationMissing
Trufitus looks at the item in awe.~|~translationMissing
I can certainly try! Hmm, incredible, it seems very ancient and mentions something about Zadimus and Ah Za Rhoon. It says, 'Here lies the traitor Zadimus, let his spirit be forever tormented'.~|~translationMissing
Trufitus hands the Stone Plaque back.~|~translationMissing
If you have found anything else that you need help with, please just let me know.~|~translationMissing
You hand the tattered scroll to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Truly amazing Bwana, this scroll must be ancient. I'm not sure if I get more meaning from it than you though. Perhaps Bervirius' tomb is still accessible?~|~translationMissing
Trufitus hands the tattered scroll back to you.~|~translationMissing
This looks quite important, are you sure you want to drop it?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm quite sure.~|~translationMissing
You decide to throw the item away...~|~translationMissing
As you drop the item, it falls down a narrow crevice, never to be seen again.~|~translationMissing
No, I think I'll keep it.~|~translationMissing
You decide to throw the item away.~|~translationMissing
As you drop the item, it gets carried away by the wind, never to be seen again.~|~translationMissing
As you drop the item, it bounces into a stream, never to be seen again.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you want to drop this crystal? It looks very delicate and it may break.~|~translationMissing
Drop the Locating Crystal?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I am sure.~|~translationMissing
As you drop the crystal, it hits a rock and explodes. You are lascerated by shards of glass.~|~translationMissing
No, I've reconsidered, I'll keep it!~|~translationMissing
You hand the crumpled scroll to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Have a look at this, tell me what you think.~|~translationMissing
I am speechless Bwana, this is truly ancient. Where did you find it?~|~translationMissing
In an underground building of some sort.~|~translationMissing
You must truly have found the temple of Ah Za Rhoon! The scroll gives some interesting details about Rashiliyia, some things I didn't know before.~|~translationMissing
Trufitus gives back the scroll.~|~translationMissing
Anything that can help?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well just that part about the wards...~|~translationMissing
Trufitus seems to drift off in thought.~|~translationMissing
It may be possible to make a ward like that... But what is the best thing to make it from? Perhaps something close to Bervirius, an item of some significance to him.~|~translationMissing
You feel an unearthly compunction to bury this corpse!~|~translationMissing
You hear a ghostly wailing sound coming from the corpse and a whispering voice says,'Let me rest in a sacred place and assist you I will'~|~translationMissing
You dig a hole for the remains.~|~translationMissing
You lay the remains of Zadimus to rest.~|~translationMissing
You hear an unearthly moaning sound as you see an apparition materialise right in front of you.~|~translationMissing
Spirit of Zadimus~|~translationMissing
You have released me from my torture, and now I shall aid you. You seek to dispell the one who tortured and killed me. Remember this... 'I am the key, but only kin may approach her.'~|~translationMissing
(Player receives bone shard.)~|~translationMissing
The apparition disappears into the ground where you buried the corpse. You see the ground in front of you shake as a shard of bone forces its way to the surface. You take the bone shard and place it in your~|~translationMissing
inventory.~|~translationMissing
You're not quite sure what to make with this. Perhaps it will come to you as you discover more about Rashiliyia?~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the Bone Shard.~|~translationMissing
Could you have a look at this please?~|~translationMissing
Trufitus looks at the object for a moment.~|~translationMissing
It looks like a simple shard of bone. Why do you think it is significant?~|~translationMissing
It appeared when I buried Zadimus' corpse.~|~translationMissing
Ah, interesting, so you think that Zadimus gave you the bone? What makes you say that?~|~translationMissing
He said something after he gave it to me.~|~translationMissing
The spirit said something about keys and kin?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, maybe it's a clue of some kind?~|~translationMissing
If you found anything at Ah Za Rhoon that you're not sure of, why not investigate it or show it to me and I'll see what I can make of it.~|~translationMissing
The spirit rambled on about some nonsense.~|~translationMissing
Oh, so it most likely was not very important then.~|~translationMissing
Oh, right. Come back and talk with me if you get an idea.~|~translationMissing
No reason really.~|~translationMissing
Well why are you showing it to me then?~|~translationMissing
You look at the shard of bone. The words of Zadimus come back to you. 'I am the key, but only kin may approach her.'~|~translationMissing
I have just buried Zadimus' corpse.~|~translationMissing
Something seems different about you. You look like you have seen a ghost?~|~translationMissing
It just so happens that I have!~|~translationMissing
Oh! So you managed to bury Zadimus's corpse?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it was pretty grisly!~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia's only kin was a son, 'Bervirius'. His remains were entombed on a small island which lies to the South West. I will do some research into this to see if I can find any other details.~|~translationMissing
But I think we must take Zadimus' clue literally and get some item that belonged to Bervirius as it may be the only way to approach Rashiliyia. Perhaps something like this exists in his tomb?~|~translationMissing
These rocks look like they have been stacked uniformly.~|~translationMissing
You investigate the rocks and find a dank, narrow crawl-way. Do you want to crawl into this dank, dark, narrow, possibly dangerous hole?~|~translationMissing
Crawl into hole?~|~translationMissing
Yes please, I can think of nothing nicer!~|~translationMissing
You contort your body and prepare to squirm worm like into the hole.~|~translationMissing
You struggle through the narrow crevice in the rocks.~|~translationMissing
And drop to your feet into a narrow underground corridor.~|~translationMissing
No way could you get me to go in there!~|~translationMissing
The dolmen is intricately decorated with the symbol of two crossed palm trees. It might be the family crest? You can see that there are some items on the dolmen.~|~translationMissing
You find a rusty sword with an ivory pommel. You take the Ivory pommel and place it in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
You find a Crystal Sphere. You take the crystal and place it carefully in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
You find some writing on the dolmen, you grab some nearby scraps of delicate paper together and copy the text as best you can and collect them together as a scroll.~|~translationMissing
You prepare the ivory pommel and the chisel to start crafting...~|~translationMissing
You successfully craft some of the ivory into beads. They may look good as part of a necklace.~|~translationMissing
You successfully craft the beads and bronze wire into a necklace which you name, 'Beads of the Dead'~|~translationMissing
You attempt to climb the granite rock.~|~translationMissing
If the player fails to climb the rock~|~translationMissing
Arrggghhhhhh!~|~translationMissing
The player is dealt 1-10 damage~|~translationMissing
If the player successfully climbs the rock~|~translationMissing
You manage to climb back out again!~|~translationMissing
This scroll is a collection of writings. Some of them are just scraps of papyrus with what looks like random scribblings. Which would you like to read?~|~translationMissing
Tattered Yellow papyrus.~|~translationMissing
Bervirius notes#Tattered Yellow papyrus~|~translationMissing
Decayed White papyrus.~|~translationMissing
Bervirius notes#Decayed White papyrus~|~translationMissing
Crusty Orange papyrus.~|~translationMissing
Bervirius notes#Crusty Orange papyrus~|~translationMissing
Greetings Bwana, did you find Bervirius' Tomb?~|~translationMissing
I think I found Bervirius' Tomb.~|~translationMissing
Congratulations Bwana, show me any items you have found though. I may be able to help.~|~translationMissing
I actually need help with something else.~|~translationMissing
What could I possibly help you with Bwana?~|~translationMissing
I didn't find anything in the tomb.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you need to look around a little more. There must be some small detail at least that can help us.~|~translationMissing
I have some items that I need some help with.~|~translationMissing
No, I didn't find a thing.~|~translationMissing
That is a shame Bwana. We really do need to act against Rashiliyia soon if we are ever to stand a chance of defeating her.~|~translationMissing
Actually I did find the tomb, I was just joking.~|~translationMissing
Well, Bwana, this is no laughing matter. We need to take this very seriously and act now! If you have found any items at the tomb that you need help with please let me see them and I will help as much as I can.~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the sword pommel.~|~translationMissing
It is a very nice item Bwana. It may be just what you need to gain access to Rashiliyia's tomb. While you were away, I did some research.~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia would spare the lives of those who wore bronze necklaces. This pommel may have some significance to Bervirius. Perhaps you can craft something from it that can help?~|~translationMissing
My guess is that you will need some protection from Rashiliyia if you intend to enter her tomb!~|~translationMissing
How do I make a bronze necklace?~|~translationMissing
Well, Bwana, I would guess that you would need to get some bronze metal and work it into something that could be turned into a necklace?~|~translationMissing
What should I put on the necklace?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps Zadimus' clue has the answer? Now, what was it that he said again? Something about kin and keys? That sword pommel belonged to Bervirius didn't it?~|~translationMissing
You're more than welcome Bwana! Good luck for the rest of your quest.~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the Locating Crystal.~|~translationMissing
This is incredible Bwana.~|~translationMissing
It is?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely! This will help you to locate the entrance to Rashiliyia's tomb. Simply activate it when you think you are near, and it should glow different colours to show how near you are.~|~translationMissing
You hand the notes over to Trufitus.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, these notes are quite extraordinary Bwana. They give location details of Rashiliyia's tomb, and some information on how to use the crystal.~|~translationMissing
The information is quite specific, North of Ah Za Rhoon! That's a great place to start looking!~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the beads that you crafted.~|~translationMissing
Take a look at these.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, very interesting Bwana, your abilities are much more focused than I had initially thought. I presume these are to be part of the ward to protect you from Rashiliyia?~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the 'Beads of the Dead'.~|~translationMissing
Take a look at this...~|~translationMissing
This is very impressive Bwana, I'm quite surprised at your ingenuity. This should be a good protection against Rashiliyia if you ever find her Tomb.~|~translationMissing
Have a look at this!~|~translationMissing
This is amazing Bwana, the level of detail is incredible. Where did you find it?~|~translationMissing
I made it from the bone shard that Zadimus gave me.~|~translationMissing
How very inventive Bwana. You must have seen the lock to have crafted it so well. Does the key work?~|~translationMissing
Yes and I explored inside some sort of cavern.~|~translationMissing
How interesting Bwana, did you find anything?~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should go back and try to find some more things.~|~translationMissing
Show me any other items that you may have. We need any clue to locate Rashiliyia's resting place.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I found lots of things.~|~translationMissing
If you let me see them Bwana, perhaps I can offer you some extra information.~|~translationMissing
I don't know, I haven't tried it yet.~|~translationMissing
It may be an idea to try it and then scout out the area. If it relates to Rashiliyia, it might help us to defeat her.~|~translationMissing
Do you know what it opens?~|~translationMissing
You must already know what it opens to have carved it so pefectly. Perhaps in your travels you have come across some unique doors with a unique lock? I hope this helps with your quest.~|~translationMissing
You search the palm trees...~|~translationMissing
...and reveal an ancient doorway set into the side of the hill!~|~translationMissing
There seems to be some sort of recepticle on the door. Perhaps it needs a key?~|~translationMissing
Examining the door, you see that it has a very strange lock. You're shocked to find that it seems to be made out of bone!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 20 Crafting~|~translationMissing
You need to have a Crafting level of at least 20 to work this material.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 20 Crafting~|~translationMissing
Remembering Zadimus' words and the strange bone lock, you start to craft the bone. You successfully make a key out of the bone shard.~|~translationMissing
You try the bone key with the lock.~|~translationMissing
A shimmering light dances over the doors, before you can blink, the doors creak open.~|~translationMissing
The doors close behind you with the sound of crunching bone. Before you stretches a winding tunnel blocked by an ancient gate.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing the Beads of the dead~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia appears!~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia~|~translationMissing
Let me squeeze the life from your mortal frame.~|~translationMissing
Which non-kin dares enter my tomb?~|~translationMissing
My minions will finish thee!~|~translationMissing
You feel invisible hands starting to choke you...~|~translationMissing
* Gaaaa.... *~|~translationMissing
Rahiliyia spawns 1-3 undead ones~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing the Beads of the dead~|~translationMissing
The Beads of the Dead start to glow...~|~translationMissing
There is an ancient symbol on the gate. It looks like a human figure with something around its neck. It looks pretty scary.~|~translationMissing
You carefully try to pick your way down the rocks.~|~translationMissing
You manage to carefully clamber down.~|~translationMissing
This door is completely sealed, it is very ornately carved.~|~translationMissing
The door is ornately carved with depictions of skeletal warriors. You notice that some of the skeletal warriors depictions are not complete.Instead, there are recesses where some of the bones should be. There are three recesses.~|~translationMissing
The door is ornately carved with depictions of skeletal warriors. You notice that some of the skeletal warriors depictions are not complete.Instead, there are recesses where some of the bones should be. There are two recesses.~|~translationMissing
The door is ornately carved with depictions of skeletal warriors. You notice that some of the skeletal warriors depictions are not complete.Instead, there are recesses where some of the bones should be. There is one recess.~|~translationMissing
The door is ornately carved with depictions of skeletal warriors. All the skeletons are complete. It looks as if you walk through this door.~|~translationMissing
If this is the first bone~|~translationMissing
You carefully place a bone in the door...~|~translationMissing
You place the bone into the skeletal door and it fits. There are two recesses left now.~|~translationMissing
You fit the bone into the recess.~|~translationMissing
If this is the second bone~|~translationMissing
You carefully place another bone in the door...~|~translationMissing
You place the bone into the skeletal door and it fits. There is just one recess left now.~|~translationMissing
If this is the third bone~|~translationMissing
You fit the last bone into the recess.~|~translationMissing
You place the bone into the last recess on the skeletal door and it fits. All the recesses are filled...~|~translationMissing
The door seems to change slightly. Two depictions of skeletal warriors turn their heads towards you. They are alive! The Skeletons wrench themselves free of the door. Stepping out of the door, with grinning teeth they push the huge doors open.~|~translationMissing
You touch the dolmen, and the ground starts to shake. You hear an unearthly voice booming and you step away from the dolmen in anticipation.~|~translationMissing
Nazastarool spawns.~|~translationMissing
Nazastarool~|~translationMissing
I am Nazastarool! Prepare to die!~|~translationMissing
Continues after killing Nazastarool.~|~translationMissing
You defeat Nazastarool and the corpse falls to the ground. The bones start to move again and soon they reform into a grisly giant skeleton.~|~translationMissing
Nazastarool spawns again.~|~translationMissing
Quake in fear, for I am reborn!~|~translationMissing
Your death will be swift.~|~translationMissing
You defeat Nazastarool and the skeleton falls to the ground. An ethereal form starts taking shape above the bones and you soon face the vengeful ghost of Nazastarool.~|~translationMissing
Nazastarool returns with vengeance!~|~translationMissing
Soon you will serve Rashiliyia.~|~translationMissing
You hear a disembodied voice fading away into the distance, 'May you perish in the fires of Zamorak's furnace! Rashiliyia's curse is upon you!'~|~translationMissing
You see something appear on the dolmen.~|~translationMissing
May you perish in the fires of Zamorak's furnace! Rashiliyia's~|~translationMissing
curse is upon you!~|~translationMissing
You take the mummified remains of a human female. You feel certain that these are Rashiliyia's remains. You carefully place the remains in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing the beads of the dead~|~translationMissing
Same as above from "Rashiliyia appears!" but also continues below~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing the beads of the dead~|~translationMissing
The door seems to be locked!~|~translationMissing
Oh no, I'm going to be stuck in here forever!~|~translationMissing
How will I ever get out!~|~translationMissing
I'm too young to die!~|~translationMissing
You can see a small recepticle, not unlike the one on the opposite side of the door!~|~translationMissing
You unlock the door with the key.~|~translationMissing
The doors creak open revealing bright daylight.~|~translationMissing
You walk outside into the warmth of the jungle heat.~|~translationMissing
You get a sense that something seems imcomplete.~|~translationMissing
You feel the crystal trying to draw upon your spiritual energy. Do you want to let it?~|~translationMissing
Yes, just this once.~|~translationMissing
If the player is too far from the Tomb of Rashiliyia~|~translationMissing
There is nothing different about the crystal. You're most likely not close enough for it to be active.~|~translationMissing
If the player is within [unknown squares] of the Tomb of Rashiliyia~|~translationMissing
The crystal glows faintly.~|~translationMissing
The crystal glows brightly.~|~translationMissing
The crystal is very bright.~|~translationMissing
The crystal blazes brilliantly.~|~translationMissing
Yes, always let it draw from my spiritual energy.~|~translationMissing
Same as above, and further activations don't provide the options.~|~translationMissing
No, it sounds a bit dangerous.~|~translationMissing
You decide not to allow the crystal to draw on your spiritual energy.~|~translationMissing
Greetings again Bwana. I hope that you have managed to locate Rashiliyia's Tomb. Again, if you found anything interesting, please show it to me.~|~translationMissing
Trufitus scratches his head.~|~translationMissing
Well Bwana, if you have Rashiliyia's remains, you need to find a way to put her spirit to rest. Perhaps there was a clue with one of the artefacts that you have?~|~translationMissing
Why not have a look through the artefacts that you have found and see if there is some clue that might help? If you do not have her remains, you will need to find them.~|~translationMissing
You show Trufitus the remains...~|~translationMissing
Could you have a look at this..~|~translationMissing
This is truly incredible bwana... So these are the remains of the dread Queen Rashiliyia?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think so.~|~translationMissing
What should I do with them?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I'm not exactly sure... Perhaps there is a clue in one of the artefacts you have found?~|~translationMissing
Can you take them off my hands?~|~translationMissing
I dare not take them, I may be taken over by the evil spirit of Rashiliyia!~|~translationMissing
You carefully place Rashiliyias remains on the dolmen. You feel a strange vibration in the air.~|~translationMissing
You have my gratitude for releasing my spirit. I have suffered a vengeful and evil existence. I was tricked by Zamorak. He returned my son to me as an undead creature.~|~translationMissing
My hatred and bitterness corrupted me. I tried to destroy all life... now I am released. And am grateful to contemplate eternal rest...~|~translationMissing
You notice nothing significant about this stone.~|~translationMissing
You notice nothing significant about this.~|~translationMissing
There is nothing new about this dolmen.~|~translationMissing
There are no more recesses to fill, you filled them all.~|~translationMissing
You have already completed this quest.~|~translationMissing
Rashiliyia's remains have been put to rest.~|~translationMissing

Veliaf? What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Well met friend. I'm here on an investigation. There's something strange going on in this town, and I suspect the vampyres are involved.~|~translationMissing
Anything I can help with?~|~translationMissing
If the player doese not have the requirements to start the quest~|~translationMissing
Not at the moment. Keep checking in though, I may have need of you soon.~|~translationMissing
Well an extra pair of hands is always beneficial. If you have the time of course?~|~translationMissing
This town has recently become home to an illness known as the Sleeper Plague. It's a nasty affliction. Those infected fall into a deep sleep, never to wake.~|~translationMissing
Now, Morytania is no stranger to odd afflictions. However, I've been doing some digging. Apparently, this isn't the first time this illness has beset Slepe. In fact, they say it's how the town was named.~|~translationMissing
And now the illness is back. You said you suspect the vampyres are involved?~|~translationMissing
I do. The first victim of the new Sleeper Plague was none other than Lady Crombwick. She rules over this town from Crombwick Manor, along with her husband.~|~translationMissing
He's not been seen since she fell ill, and their manor has been locked down.~|~translationMissing
Here's the interesting part though. Vampyres have been seen around the manor. Apparently they showed up around the time when the Sleeper Plague returned.~|~translationMissing
I see where this is going. You think the vampyres are the reason the plague is back.~|~translationMissing
I do. The question is, why?~|~translationMissing
I guess that's for us to work out. Where do we start?~|~translationMissing
We'll split up. I'm going to try and learn more about these vampyres at the manor. While I do that, I want you to try and find the source of the illness.~|~translationMissing
They're looking after the victims in this church here. I'd recommend you make that your starting point.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like a plan. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
And to you. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
How have things been for you recently?~|~translationMissing
We haven't been doing too bad. Even out in Mort Myre, the impact of Ranis' death can be seen.~|~translationMissing
People have a little bit more hope now, and it has become easier for us to gather support.~|~translationMissing
That's good to know.~|~translationMissing
Of course, there are downsides. The vampyres are hunting us with ever greater determination. But this is the life we chose.~|~translationMissing
What do you know about this place?~|~translationMissing
Slepe? It's wretched. The people of this town follow the teachings of Zamorak. Some are no better than the vampyres themselves.~|~translationMissing
Do they get on with the vampyres?~|~translationMissing
As well as any humans can. All settlements in Morytania must pay the vampyres in blood tithes, but the people of Slepe do so willingly.~|~translationMissing
They see the vampyres as fellow servants of Zamorak. Of course, the vampyres only really serve themselves.~|~translationMissing
So why do these people follow Zamorak?~|~translationMissing
Apparently this place was founded by a group called the Sisterhood, former healers of Saradomin that turned to Zamorak.~|~translationMissing
Their order still exists to this day. You'll probably see a few of them around the town.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me any more about the Sleeper Plague?~|~translationMissing
What I told you is pretty much what I know. The illness causes people to fall to sleep, never to wake again.~|~translationMissing
There's a rumour that the infected are also granted immortality, though I don't know if there's any truth in this.~|~translationMissing
To be honest, immortality doesn't seem very useful if you're unable to wake up.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. If history is to be believed, this is the second time the Sleeper Plague has hit Slepe. The first occurrence was many years ago and is supposedly what gave the town its name.~|~translationMissing
That's all I know. That said, I suspect you might be able to learn more if you do some digging around town.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm a bit busy right now. Maybe later.~|~translationMissing
Very well friend. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
You need to try and find the source of the Sleeper Plague. I'd start in the church. That's where they're looking after the victims.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like a plan.~|~translationMissing
You don't look too happy?~|~translationMissing
Hameln the Jester~|~translationMissing
You're not wrong about that. It's my travelling companion, Hanchen. They say he's the latest victim of the Sleeper Plague.~|~translationMissing
Do you know how he fell ill?~|~translationMissing
I've no idea. We'd just been to the pub for a quick drink. On our way back, he started to act all odd, then he just collapsed.~|~translationMissing
Pub?~|~translationMissing
Yes. The Rat & Bat just south east of here. I'm not a drinker myself but Hanchen's always loved a good tipple.~|~translationMissing
Wait... you mean to say you weren't drinking?~|~translationMissing
No, I never drink. Hanchen on the other hand was loving those Bloody Bracers.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) You don't look like locals.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Bye!~|~translationMissing
Like I said, I've no idea. We'd just been to the pub when it happened. Hanchen's always loved a good drink.~|~translationMissing
Well met friend. How goes the investigation?~|~translationMissing
Apparently the latest victim of the Sleeper Plague was at the pub shortly before falling ill.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. Might be worth a look.~|~translationMissing
Agreed. I'll see if I can discover anything.~|~translationMissing
What ales are you serving?~|~translationMissing
Carl~|~translationMissing
We serve Crombwick's finest Bloody Bracer, that is all.~|~translationMissing
Sounds rough, how much?~|~translationMissing
99 of your finest coins.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Alright, one Bloody Bracer, if that's all you have.~|~translationMissing
Where do you get your Bloody Bracers from?~|~translationMissing
It's an old recipe of the Crombwick family.~|~translationMissing
Okay. But the actual Bloody Bracers you sell, where do they come from?~|~translationMissing
Who's asking?~|~translationMissing
Well... me of course.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but what I mean is, why do you want to know?~|~translationMissing
Does it matter?~|~translationMissing
My supplier is a private individual. He doesn't like others meddling in his affairs. So yes, it does matter.~|~translationMissing
I represent... health?~|~translationMissing
Health? What are you on about?~|~translationMissing
Err... Health and safety of course, here on a routine inspection.~|~translationMissing
Part of my work requires me to inspect the source of your Bloody Bracers. I was hoping you'd put me in touch with your supplier.~|~translationMissing
I don't know what you're on about. There're no routine inspections here. Now clear off, I have customers to serve!~|~translationMissing
Well I might just have a look around anyway.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) 99 coins? That's ridiculous!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What can you tell me about this town?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Actually, I'm no longer thirsty.~|~translationMissing
You don't give up do you. I'm not telling you anything so clear off.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Looks like Carl is pretty much out of Bloody Bracer. He'll need to collect more from his supplier soon.~|~translationMissing
Huh. Looks like we're all out of Bloody Bracer again.~|~translationMissing
Alright then Carl. Let's see what you're hiding...~|~translationMissing
The player begins following Carl~|~translationMissing
Hey! I see you there!~|~translationMissing
Carl heads into the Sisterhood Sanctuary~|~translationMissing
The dungeon Carl? What are you hiding down there?~|~translationMissing
Carl enters Kroy's lab.~|~translationMissing
Kroy~|~translationMissing
Carl? What do you want?~|~translationMissing
Kroy. We've run out of Bloody Bracer again.~|~translationMissing
Did you really need to come here to tell me that?~|~translationMissing
There's something else as well. Someone's been poking around, asking about Bloody Bracer.~|~translationMissing
I don't know. They don't look to be from around here.~|~translationMissing
So someone's been snooping around asking questions, and you decided to come here? What if they followed you?~|~translationMissing
I... I thought you'd want to know.~|~translationMissing
You're a fool Carl. If you're not careful, you'll jeopardise everything.~|~translationMissing
Hey! I don't need to help you!~|~translationMissing
No, you don't. Your predecessor didn't want to help us. Perhaps you remember what came of him?~|~translationMissing
Go back to your pub Carl. I'll have more Bloody Bracer sent over soon. In the meantime, try to be a bit smarter.~|~translationMissing
Carl leaves the lab, failing to notice the player eavesdropping. Afterwards, Damien Leucurte enters the lab, followed by Vanstrom Klause.~|~translationMissing
Alright then, Damien. What is it that you're so keen to show me?~|~translationMissing
Damien Leucurte~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom, I'd like you to meet Kroy.~|~translationMissing
Greetings, my lord.~|~translationMissing
Don't tell me you had me come all the way down here for this? Look at the wretched thing, Damien. It's barely even a proper juvenile.~|~translationMissing
Well just hang on there, Vanstrom. Kroy may not look like much, but I've never met a vampyre with a better knowledge of herblore.~|~translationMissing
Kroy, tell him what you found.~|~translationMissing
Of course, my lord.~|~translationMissing
It was hidden deep within the sanctuary here. A recipe, for an elixir.~|~translationMissing
An elixir?~|~translationMissing
Yes! The ones that built the place, the Sisterhood, they called it the Elixir of Everlasting.~|~translationMissing
And just what is this Elixir of Everlasting?~|~translationMissing
Those who drink it find their lives heavily extended, but at a cost. They are put into a deep sleep, never to wake.~|~translationMissing
So the Sleeper Plague? That was your doing?~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Using the recipe, Kroy was easily able to recreate the elixir. After a quick test on Lady Crombwick, we started giving it to the citizens.~|~translationMissing
We hide it in their beer, Bloody Bracer. They've no idea what it's really doing to them!~|~translationMissing
And while they sleep, we tithe them. The sleepers only need a fraction of the blood a normal human needs, so we can take more than ever before!~|~translationMissing
And tell me, Damien, who gave you permission to do this?~|~translationMissing
The nobles of Darkmeyer make their demands Vanstrom. Someone has to meet them.~|~translationMissing
That someone is not you. I am in charge of blood tithing. I alone decide how it is to be carried out.~|~translationMissing
The nobles are restless. They are tired of inaction. I saw an opportunity and I took it. Lord Drakan should thank me.~|~translationMissing
I don't doubt the ingenuity of your plan. This elixir could have great potential. The thing I doubt is your recklessness. This Sleeper Plague has attracted attention. The wrong kind of attention.~|~translationMissing
The Myreque? Don't tell me you're scared of that lot, Vanstrom? I thought you were made of stronger stuff.~|~translationMissing
I do not fear the Myreque. I have no need to. They have no way of touching me.~|~translationMissing
But you on the other hand, you should be very afraid. Out here alone, without the support of the Drakan household. You're a prime target. And if what I hear is true, they're right on your doorstep.~|~translationMissing
The Myreque are already here in Slepe, Damien. The one that killed Ranis Drakan is among them. Your overconfidence has begun your downfall.~|~translationMissing
Well you'll have to do something. You'll need to send us some support.~|~translationMissing
I will do no such thing. You defied Lord Drakan when you came out here. The consequences of your actions are your own to deal with.~|~translationMissing
Now, if you'll excuse me, I will be on my way. There are things in Darkmeyer that require my attention.~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom leaves via the ladder, followed by Damien. The player enters Kroy's lab immediately after.~|~translationMissing
How much did you hear, human?~|~translationMissing
Enough.~|~translationMissing
I see. Then you know that I can't let you leave this place alive.~|~translationMissing
Tempting offer. Death isn't on my to-do list today though, so I'll have to decline.~|~translationMissing
A joker? Your arrogance will be your end, human.~|~translationMissing
We'll see.~|~translationMissing
Yes... We shall...~|~translationMissing
Kroy attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
Well that's him dealt with. I should destroy his lab as well. Don't want anyone else continuing his work.~|~translationMissing
The player destroys the tables~|~translationMissing
There. That should stop anyone from continuing Kroy's work. I should inform Veliaf.~|~translationMissing
Well met friend. Anything to report?~|~translationMissing
You were right about the vampyres. I did some digging and discovered that they are indeed the cause of the Sleeper Plague.~|~translationMissing
A vampyre in the dungeon called Kroy was making infected Bloody Bracers. The local barkeep was then selling them to the townspeople.~|~translationMissing
I put a stop to that though. I killed Kroy and destroyed his lab. The barkeep has no supply now.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work friend. This should stop any new cases of the illness.~|~translationMissing
There's something else, too. While I was spying on Kroy, I saw Vanstrom Klause with another vampyre called Damien. It sounded like Damien was Kroy's boss.~|~translationMissing
The vampyre you speak of is a noble called Damien Leucurte. He's a known quantity to us. My investigations at the manor also involved the two of them, but let's hear the rest of your findings first.~|~translationMissing
Well, in their conversations, it was revealed why they caused the new Sleeper Plague. Apparently, they did it to make it easier to take blood tithes.~|~translationMissing
But here's the interesting thing. Vanstrom didn't seem very happy with this. It sounded like Damien was doing it without his permission.~|~translationMissing
This is all very interesting. The citizens of this town are Zamorakians and willingly give their blood to the vampyres. Why would Damien need the Sleeper Plague?~|~translationMissing
He talked about increased demand from the nobles of Darkmeyer. Perhaps they have need for more blood than normal?~|~translationMissing
That would make sense. I've heard rumours that the vampyre population has grown such that demand for blood now exceeds supply. Damien may be looking for ways to satisfy this demand.~|~translationMissing
Even so, this seems extreme. And to go behind Vanstrom's back as well? Maybe their overcrowding issues are bigger than we first realised.~|~translationMissing
Maybe. So, what's our next move?~|~translationMissing
I have an idea about that, although my information is not quite as exciting as yours I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
While I was investigating the manor, I discovered that it has indeed been taken over by vampyres. Our friend Damien seems to be the leader of this group.~|~translationMissing
During my time there, I also managed to spy on Vanstrom and Damien. I only heard a small part of their conversation, but Vanstrom didn't seem very happy, which matches up with what you heard.~|~translationMissing
At one point, Vanstrom insulted Damien for his recklessness and accused him of demanding too much from the werewolves. Sounds like they've also been gathering extra blood without permission.~|~translationMissing
That sounds familiar. I suspect it was werewolves who attacked me that time at Paterdomus.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that encounter also sprung into my mind. It sounds like things are even worse now.~|~translationMissing
So you want to investigate the werewolves?~|~translationMissing
I do indeed. Something is going on in Darkmeyer that's causing this increased demand. If there's unrest in the city, we might be able to use it to our advantage.~|~translationMissing
What about Slepe? Should we not deal with Damien as well?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. Your actions will have drawn attention to us. We cannot stay here. It sounds like Damien can do little without Kroy, so I doubt he'll be much trouble anyway.~|~translationMissing
Besides, we've already done too much for these Zamorakians. There are others more deserving of our time.~|~translationMissing
But aren't we meant to help people?~|~translationMissing
That's a complicated question friend. But yes, of course we are meant to help people.~|~translationMissing
Then why are we letting Damien get away with this? Carl as well?~|~translationMissing
Damien and Carl are small fish in a very big pond. Dealing with them might help the people here, but it will mean nothing to the rest of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
If we want to help as many people as possible, we need to think bigger than that. The Drakan family, they are the real targets.~|~translationMissing
I suppose. It just seems harsh to leave these people in the hands of a vampyre like Damien.~|~translationMissing
We've already done a lot to help here. Besides, Damien will get what's coming to him in the end, I'm sure of that.~|~translationMissing
You're sure this isn't just because they're Zamorakian?~|~translationMissing
Zamorakians are evil my friend, it does not shame me to say it. But no, if this were a Saradominist town, my actions would be the same.~|~translationMissing
Okay, fair enough.~|~translationMissing
You have a good heart my friend. I have a lot of respect for that. I assure you that if we keep on our current path, we will bring freedom to all of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Veliaf. So, what's our next move?~|~translationMissing
Meet me at Paterdomus friend. We will check in with Drezel and Ivan, before continuing our investigation.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Be careful out there. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, so what now?~|~translationMissing
Well met friend. Good to see you made it in one piece.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, I hear Morytania becomes more dangerous by the day.~|~translationMissing
You can say that again. Good to see you Drezel. Has Veliaf already filled you in?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, I thought it best to wait for you.~|~translationMissing
But you're here now, so let's get started.~|~translationMissing
Well Drezel, the reason we are here is due to an investigation we've been conducting in Slepe.~|~translationMissing
Ah. I hear it's a nasty place, full of Zamorakian filth. Suffering from some sort of outbreak as well, I've been told.~|~translationMissing
Yes, the Sleeper Plague. It turns out, however, that the vampyres are responsible.~|~translationMissing
Seems that one of their nobles, Damien Leucurte, has been looking for ways to increase blood output. Interestingly, he's been doing it without consent from the Drakan family.~|~translationMissing
That's right. Vanstrom doesn't seem to be very happy about it.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. It's odd you should come to report this, because we've also experienced some strange happenings around here.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Do these strange happenings have anything to do with werewolves, by any chance?~|~translationMissing
They do.~|~translationMissing
I knew it. What's been going on?~|~translationMissing
Well, after [player name] here was ambushed outside the temple a while back, Ivan and I decided to keep a closer eye on things.~|~translationMissing
For a time, nothing unusual happened. The reports of trouble in the area died down, and everything seemed normal.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps their encounter with you scared them off, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Maybe. But if so, it was only for a time. A few weeks ago, the reports of people going missing in the area started again. And they're much worse this time.~|~translationMissing
Entire groups have been going missing. Not just miners and travellers either. Even some of the king's mercenaries have vanished.~|~translationMissing
Did you send word to the king?~|~translationMissing
We did. His adviser though, Aeonisig, encouraged him to refrain from military action.~|~translationMissing
Typical. This is why I hate politics.~|~translationMissing
Has anyone seen who's been doing this? Is it definitely werewolves?~|~translationMissing
We believe so. Ivan has been keeping a close watch. The disappearances have mostly taken place further up the pass, however, so it's taken a while for him to find any leads.~|~translationMissing
But he has found one?~|~translationMissing
Yes, last night. He overheard a hooded figure mention a meeting in the Haunted Woods, directly south of Fenkenstrain's Castle, that is apparently set for today.~|~translationMissing
Perfect. Sounds like that's where we should head next then.~|~translationMissing
On the topic of Ivan, where is he Drezel?~|~translationMissing
Ah... Well that's just the thing. He went to spy on the meeting.~|~translationMissing
What? You just let him go? He's just a boy!~|~translationMissing
He's a grown man, Veliaf! One far smarter than either you or I. If he wants to do something, he will do it. I can't stop him!~|~translationMissing
You should have sent word to us! This is for us to deal with, not him!~|~translationMissing
There wasn't time. He only found out about the meeting last night!~|~translationMissing
Ivan is still a member of the Myreque, isn't he? Surely he can look after himself.~|~translationMissing
That's not the point! He needs to be kept safe!~|~translationMissing
I don't understand. Why is Ivan so important?~|~translationMissing
Ivan... Well, Ivan is special. He is the last in his bloodline.~|~translationMissing
And what bloodline is that?~|~translationMissing
Ivan is the last living descendant of Ivandis Seergaze himself. Once I am gone, he will be the only remaining descendant of the Seven Priestly Warriors.~|~translationMissing
Seven Priestly Warriors?~|~translationMissing
Are you becoming forgetful, [player name]? The Seven Priestly Warriors were the ones who originally blessed the River Salve.~|~translationMissing
Without their sacrifice, Drakan and his kin would have long since taken over Misthalin.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I remember. So, this is why you want to keep Ivan safe, Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
I see. So that's why you want to keep him safe, Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
It's not just about that. There's also the promise I made. Before his mother died, I swore to her on my life that I would shield Ivan from any harm.~|~translationMissing
Though I nearly failed her when Vanstrom killed Sani and Harold.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf, my friend, you and I will not be around to protect Ivan forever. We have guided him to this point, but maybe it's time for him to start looking after himself.~|~translationMissing
And what of his learnings here? You would have him abandon them?~|~translationMissing
I have taught Ivan everything I know. There is nothing more he can gain from me.~|~translationMissing
Forgive me, but this can be resolved later. For now, we need to find Ivan and see what this meeting is about.~|~translationMissing
Yes, you're absolutely right, friend. Forgive us. Directly south of Fenkenstrain's Castle. Is that right Drezel?~|~translationMissing
That's right. In the Haunted Woods.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Meet me there, [player name]. Let's see if we can find out what's going on.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and [player name], I would appreciate it if you could avoid mentioning the stuff about Ivandis Seergaze to Ivan. One day he will have to bear that burden. But for now, he has enough weight on his shoulders.~|~translationMissing
Good luck to you both. Saradomin be with you.~|~translationMissing
Meet me in the Haunted Woods, just south of Fenkenstrain's Castle. We will hopefully find Ivan there.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll see you there.~|~translationMissing
You should head for the Haunted Woods, friend. With luck, you'll find Ivan just south of Fenkenstrain's Castle.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about the Seven Priestly Warriors?~|~translationMissing
Well at this point you should be no stranger to their tale, though I understand the desire for a recap.~|~translationMissing
During the Fourth Age, the vampyre forces of Lowerniel Drakan attempted to invade Misthalin. They would have succeeded, were it not for the Seven Priestly Warriors.~|~translationMissing
The warriors were the ones to bless the River Salve and build this temple, ensuring that Misthalin would be forever safe from the evils of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Sadly, all seven of them fell in the final battle against Drakan. They are now buried here, in this very mausoleum.~|~translationMissing
I don't know if that's completely true.~|~translationMissing
You talk of the suggestion that Ivandis Seergaze isn't actually buried with the others, don't you? That isn't a conversation I wish to have.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Anything else you can tell me about the Warriors?~|~translationMissing
Not really. You might learn more in the library below, but I'd be cautious of believing every word in those books.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Thanks Drezel.~|~translationMissing
I'm on it.~|~translationMissing
[player name]! So good to see you. What brings you out here?~|~translationMissing
Hello there, Ivan. Believe it or not, I'm actually here for you.~|~translationMissing
For me? I'm guessing Drezel sent you?~|~translationMissing
That's right. He told us of your discovery about the werewolves. We came to lend a hand.~|~translationMissing
We? Is Veliaf with you?~|~translationMissing
Yes. We've been investigating something together. We suspect it may be connected to this situation with the werewolves. I imagine he'll be here shortly.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf arrives at the meeting spot.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf!~|~translationMissing
Ivan. It's good to see you safe.~|~translationMissing
And you. [player name] says you're here about the werewolves.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. But Ivan, you shouldn't be out here. It's not safe for you. Head back to the temple, let [player name] and I take it from here.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, Veliaf. I can look after myself.~|~translationMissing
Ivan...~|~translationMissing
Wait! Look!~|~translationMissing
Three werewolves arrive at the meeting spot with a family of prisoners, and greet Damien and two vampyre juvinates.~|~translationMissing
You're late.~|~translationMissing
Werewolf~|~translationMissing
Well look who it is. Damien Leucurte! I thought you didn't like to associate with our lot.~|~translationMissing
Scared of getting mud on his pretty clothes, I bet.~|~translationMissing
Mind your tongue, dog, or I'll have you put in a collar.~|~translationMissing
Your threats mean nothing out here Damien. There're no Drakans around to protect you.~|~translationMissing
Not that Drakan protection means much these days anyway. His own brother killed by a human. How does he respond? He stays hiding in his fancy castle.~|~translationMissing
Ha! You think this one would get Drakan protection even if he were about? I hear Vanstrom has found out about this little side venture. Little Damien has been a very naughty boy.~|~translationMissing
Enough of this! What do you have for me?~|~translationMissing
A nice family of three, out for a little picnic a bit too close to the Salve.~|~translationMissing
Prisoner~|~translationMissing
Please... don't hurt us. We'll do anything!~|~translationMissing
Shut up!~|~translationMissing
Three? Is that all?~|~translationMissing
Well if you want more, you're welcome to cross the Salve yourself and get them.~|~translationMissing
There's been a setback with our operations in Slepe. We need you to make up the shortfall. Next time, bring more.~|~translationMissing
You assume there's going to be a next time. I bet you don't last another week now that the Myreque are running around with vampyre-killing weapons.~|~translationMissing
A week? He won't even last another day at the rate he's going!~|~translationMissing
I tire of your arrogance. We're done here.~|~translationMissing
Yes, we are. See you around Damien.~|~translationMissing
Or not.~|~translationMissing
The werewolves leave the meeting.~|~translationMissing
So it's as we suspected. The werewolves have been taking people from across the Salve.~|~translationMissing
But they've been doing so without permission, just like in Slepe.~|~translationMissing
This doesn't give us anything more to go on though. We have our suspicions, but we still don't know for sure why they are doing this.~|~translationMissing
Should we follow them? Maybe we'll learn more if we do. We might also get a chance to save that poor family.~|~translationMissing
No, it's too risky. Last thing we need is you getting captured, Ivan.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... Do you two hear something?~|~translationMissing
Go on then! Finish it!~|~translationMissing
Oh Veliaf my dear, If I'd wanted you dead I'd have done it a long time ago.~|~translationMissing
You're not here to kill us?~|~translationMissing
No... I'm here to talk...~|~translationMissing
Vanescula transforms into her human form.~|~translationMissing
So... Let's talk.~|~translationMissing
I take it you know who I am?~|~translationMissing
You're Vanescula Drakan, sister to Lowerniel Drakan.~|~translationMissing
And formally, sister to Ranis Drakan, before [player name] here came along.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, [player name], the great vampyre slayer. I would thank you, were it not for the fact that his funeral was such a dull affair.~|~translationMissing
Wait... You wanted him dead?~|~translationMissing
There was no love between Ranis and I. You did us a favour when you got rid of him.~|~translationMissing
That's a shame. Maybe I shouldn't have bothered.~|~translationMissing
Oh on the contrary, the death of Ranis was just what we needed.~|~translationMissing
Save your words. You didn't come to thank us for Ranis. Why are you here?~|~translationMissing
Ah, and there I was thinking we were starting to become friends. Fine. I'm here to make you an offer. A once in a lifetime offer.~|~translationMissing
You've already killed one of my brothers. Now I offer you the chance to kill the other.~|~translationMissing
Alone, you have no hope of ever getting close to Lowerniel. Now, I on the otherhand, can get you right into his chambers at Castle Drakan.~|~translationMissing
And why would you want that?~|~translationMissing
I have my reasons.~|~translationMissing
I will, but not here.~|~translationMissing
Where then?~|~translationMissing
To the south east of Meiyerditch, there's an old graveyard. The Icyene Graveyard, we call it. Gather the Myreque, every member, and meet me there. That is where I will present my proposal.~|~translationMissing
Every member of the Myreque? Do you take us for fools? You're trying to lure us all there to wipe us out.~|~translationMissing
As I said to you earlier, Veliaf, if I wanted you dead I'd have done it long ago.~|~translationMissing
You're bluffing!~|~translationMissing
Am I? So if I were to head to the Burgh de Rott inn and go down into the basement, what would I find?~|~translationMissing
You...~|~translationMissing
If I were to give the order, I could have the heads of every member of the Myreque mounted above the gates of Castle Drakan before the day is out.~|~translationMissing
Don't be so sure. There's more of us than you think.~|~translationMissing
Is there now? Do you refer to the elusive Calsidiu, the apparent leader of the Myreque?~|~translationMissing
A lie, I'm afraid. I know exactly how many of you there are. And that number isn't as big as you'd like to pretend.~|~translationMissing
A lie? Veliaf...~|~translationMissing
You've made your point Vanescula. How do we get to this graveyard?~|~translationMissing
A boat will be your easiest way I imagine. I'll let you worry about the details.~|~translationMissing
Incidentally, should you fail to attend...~|~translationMissing
You'll mount our heads above the gates of Castle Drakan. Yeah, we get it.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, glad we understand one another. I will await you at the graveyard.~|~translationMissing
This isn't good.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf... You lied about Calsidiu and the other Myreque?~|~translationMissing
Yes. But it was with good intention, Ivan. To believe there were more of us out there... It inspired hope in our ranks, and fear in our enemies.~|~translationMissing
A false hope.~|~translationMissing
Better than none at all. Ivan, I have made some tough choices over my years, but every one of them was for the good of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
Okay... I understand. I don't like it, but I understand.~|~translationMissing
I don't like it either. Later, we will sit down and properly discuss this. However, at the moment I fear we have more pressing matters.~|~translationMissing
Vanescula. What do we do?~|~translationMissing
Go back to Paterdomus, Ivan. [player name] and I will handle it.~|~translationMissing
But you heard what she said. She asked for all the Myreque. Veliaf, I'm one of the Myreque, I have to come with you.~|~translationMissing
Come with us? What makes you think we're even going? What makes you think we have any intention of listening to that witch?~|~translationMissing
We don't have a choice, Veliaf, you know that. If we don't go, she'll kill us all.~|~translationMissing
I fear Ivan is right. It doesn't seem like Vanescula has given us any other options.~|~translationMissing
Exactly. The decision has already been made for us, so I see little point in debating it. We're going. All of us.~|~translationMissing
Dammit Ivan! I'm trying to keep you safe!~|~translationMissing
You can't keep me safe, Veliaf. No one can. While Lowerniel Drakan lives, none of us will ever be safe.~|~translationMissing
We have to do this. It's the only choice we have.~|~translationMissing
Fine. But don't expect me to even pretend to be happy about this! Breaking bread with a vampyre! What have we come to?~|~translationMissing
We're not breaking bread with her. We're going to see what she has to offer. If she tries anything, [player name] here can deal with her, just like he did to her brother.~|~translationMissing
It would be my pleasure. What's our plan?~|~translationMissing
I will travel down to Burgh de Rott and inform Radigad and Polmafi of this plight we find ourselves in. I'll also have word sent to Safalaan and the others in Meiyerditch.~|~translationMissing
[player name], I would appreciate it if you could escort Ivan down to Burgh de Rott.~|~translationMissing
I need to collect some things from Paterdomus first. I'll update Drezel while I'm there. Once I'm done, I'll meet you outside the temple, on the Canifis side.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good to me.~|~translationMissing
I will see you both at the boathouse in Burgh de Rott. We can use the boat there to get to this graveyard. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Ivan and Veliaf depart, leaving you alone in the woods.~|~translationMissing
Hey there [player name]. I think I'm all ready to depart when you are.~|~translationMissing
What's our plan?~|~translationMissing
We need to travel through Mort Myre Swamp to Burgh de Rott. We may encounter all kinds of evil on our way, so you'd probably best prepare to fight.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to go to Burgh de Rott?~|~translationMissing
Then let us depart.~|~translationMissing
Temple Trekking minigame starts~|~translationMissing
I need to prepare first.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be here once you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name].~|~translationMissing
I'm good. The swamps haven't beaten me yet.~|~translationMissing
How are things between you and Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
Oh don't be worrying about that. Veliaf and I butt heads all the time. It's harmless, though. He's like a father to me.~|~translationMissing
He seems to worry a lot about you.~|~translationMissing
He thinks I'd be safer back with Drezel. I can't stay hidden away forever though. Drezel's teachings were valuable, but I can ultimately do more good out here.~|~translationMissing
And what of the Calsidiu stuff?~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I still need to think on that. Ask me again later.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of this Vanescula business?~|~translationMissing
It's dangerous, but we don't have any choice. Besides, we're no strangers to danger.~|~translationMissing
Who knows, maybe this will even work out for us.~|~translationMissing
And if it doesn't?~|~translationMissing
Keep that flail of yours nearby.~|~translationMissing
Well that's torn it... Looks like we can't get over this bog. We'll have to go back to Paterdomus.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm sure we can find a way through!~|~translationMissing
That's amazing! I'll have to do the same.~|~translationMissing
That was great! But we really should be heading off now.~|~translationMissing
Rotten luck! The bridge is out. Do you think there's a way over?~|~translationMissing
I reckon we can come up with something.~|~translationMissing
And what do we have here? Looks like some fresh Myreque meat!~|~translationMissing
Hang on... That's the Slayer! The one that killed Ranis Drakan!~|~translationMissing
Another successful journey. Thanks, [player name].~|~translationMissing
I'll meet you down at the boathouse. I imagine Veliaf is there already.~|~translationMissing
Ivan departs towards the boathouse.~|~translationMissing
Well, here we are. Likely going to our doom.~|~translationMissing
At least we go together.~|~translationMissing
Touching, but ultimately meaningless.~|~translationMissing
Ever the optimist, aren't you Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
Is everything ready?~|~translationMissing
Radigad has scouted out the graveyard. It's empty, for now. Vanescula's probably waiting for all of us to arrive before she makes her move.~|~translationMissing
What of Safalaan and the others?~|~translationMissing
Polmafi managed to get in contact with them. They will meet us there.~|~translationMissing
I guess we'd better get going then.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. No point delaying the inevitable. Hop in the boat once you're ready, friend. We're right behind you.~|~translationMissing
Hop in the boat once you're ready, friend. We're right behind you.~|~translationMissing
Hey. You should get into the boat if you're ready to go.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, [player name].~|~translationMissing
And you, Kael.~|~translationMissing
You'd best talk to Veliaf and Safalaan. They are the big bosses after all.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have another Drakan's Medallion?~|~translationMissing
I'll go speak to them.~|~translationMissing
Well met friend.~|~translationMissing
Radigad. Good to see you.~|~translationMissing
I hope you came well armed my friend. These are dangerous times.~|~translationMissing
When are they not?~|~translationMissing
True. It looks like Veliaf and Safalaan are waiting for you. We will talk more later.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. Looks like Veliaf and Safalaan want to speak to you. Let's talk after.~|~translationMissing
Okay. See you soon.~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]. Glad to have you with us. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you Vertida. How are things?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I don't know. Ask me again if we're still alive after this meeting.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I need another flail.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Talk later.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Have you spoken to Veliaf and Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
Ah, probably best that you do. That vampyre could arrive at any moment.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf! It has been far too long my friend.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, Safalaan. Though I wish it were under better circumstances.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. And [player name], good to see you as well. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Myreque prevail, Safalaan. How are things in Meiyerditch?~|~translationMissing
As dark as ever, my friend. The vyrewatch have doubled their efforts to find us since the death of Ranis and the citizens are being tithed more than ever before.~|~translationMissing
That said, it does feel like there is now a glimmer of hope where previously there was only darkness. While more ferocious, the vampyres also seem a bit more cautious now.~|~translationMissing
They know we can kill them. They finally know what fear feels like.~|~translationMissing
We're also seeing greater support from the people than ever before. Whereas once they'd only speak of the Myreque in whispers, now they speak of us loudly and with pride.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, let's focus on the matter at hand. I must say Veliaf, over the years I've come to expect the unexpected, but your message was something else altogether.~|~translationMissing
I mean, Vanescula Drakan herself! We find ourselves in very strange times.~|~translationMissing
Strange, and also dangerous. I do not like any aspect of this.~|~translationMissing
Well I won't pretend this isn't risky. But I have faith in [player name], here. The first human to kill a vyre, and quite the vyre it was. Vanescula would be unwise to try anything.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of [player name], about that other matter I mentioned in my message...~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course. [player name], after due consideration by Veliaf and I, we would like to promote you to the rank of lieutenant in the Myreque. Congratulations!~|~translationMissing
You've done well, friend. I realise it doesn't mean much, but we wanted to thank you in some way for all of your work so far.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. It's a great honour.~|~translationMissing
I wish we had time to celebrate, but time is in short supply these days. I imagine Vanescula will be here very soon. Are we ready?~|~translationMissing
As ready as we'll ever be. Let's do this.~|~translationMissing
Vanescula arrives at the Icyene Graveyard.~|~translationMissing
Well Vanescula, here we are. All the Myreque, just like you wanted.~|~translationMissing
Your move.~|~translationMissing
I'm impressed Veliaf. I did fear you'd go and do something silly.~|~translationMissing
Skip the small talk. Why are we here?~|~translationMissing
Fine. Conversing with you is a chore, anyway.~|~translationMissing
The reason I have gathered you all here is because I have an offer for you.~|~translationMissing
Now I won't deny, you've not done a bad job. Killing Ranis was no small achievement, but you managed it all the same.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately for you, you're still no closer to the true prize.~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel Drakan.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. That is why I have come to you. Only with my help will you have any hope of killing my brother.~|~translationMissing
And what do you gain from this?~|~translationMissing
Long ago, the land of Morytania was known as Hallowvale and it was ruled over by a race of Saradominists called the icyene.~|~translationMissing
But then your brother came along.~|~translationMissing
Correct. Hallowvale was taken over by my kind, and Lowerniel became ruler of the newly named Morytania.~|~translationMissing
And you know what? It was the worst thing that ever happened to us.~|~translationMissing
My brother was a great conqueror, make no mistake. But he is a poor ruler. And now, thanks to him, our society is collapsing.~|~translationMissing
Collapsing how?~|~translationMissing
I know you've already been investigating Damien Leucurte and his not so secret arrangement with some of Darkmeyer's nobles.~|~translationMissing
Tell me, have you worked out why this arrangement exists?~|~translationMissing
We could have a good guess.~|~translationMissing
Well I can give you better than guesses. Allow me to offer some clarity.~|~translationMissing
Every day that goes by, the number of humans in Morytania decreases. Yet while this happens, our population continues to grow. Unsurprisingly, we no longer have enough blood to go around.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, yeah. We've suspected as much for a long time. Why is this relevant?~|~translationMissing
It's relevant because while all of this happens, our great leader remains absent. Lowerniel never liked to show his face, but these days it's as if he doesn't even exist. He spends months in his chambers, refusing to see anyone.~|~translationMissing
So you wish to take his place. What makes you think we'll help you with that?~|~translationMissing
There was once a time where humans and vampyres lived together in a great empire. Under my rule, I would see us return to that way of life.~|~translationMissing
Morytania would become a land of peace and prosperity, with humans and vampyres living side by side.~|~translationMissing
Or we could just kill both you and your brother and take back Morytania for humanity!~|~translationMissing
Ha! You could try. Even if you were to succeed though, which isn't likely, one of the other vampyre lords or ladies would just take over instead.~|~translationMissing
No. If you want to save your people, my way is the only way.~|~translationMissing
Why do you need us though? Why not just kill your brother yourself?~|~translationMissing
I could, but even today there are many in Darkmeyer who still blindly believe in Lowerniel. It will be much easier for me to take his place if I am not responsible for his demise.~|~translationMissing
You'd have us become your scapegoats.~|~translationMissing
Is that such a bad thing? Your people would consider you heroes. You'd be the ones to finally kill Lowerniel Drakan.~|~translationMissing
How do we know you won't just kill us once this is done?~|~translationMissing
You don't. But Castle Drakan is impenetrable. You'll never get inside on your own, and Lowerniel clearly has no intention of coming out. This is your only option.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's probably also worth mentioning that I can't afford any loose ends. If you decline, I would expect you to leave Morytania immediately.~|~translationMissing
To stay would have dire consequences for your life expectancy.~|~translationMissing
Say we accept your offer. How do you propose to get us into the castle?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the plan itself. You will pose as my prisoners and I shall escort you to Castle Drakan. Your capture is something that even Lowerniel will be unable to ignore.~|~translationMissing
And once inside, we kill him.~|~translationMissing
Exactly. A nice and simple plan.~|~translationMissing
Too simple, if you ask me.~|~translationMissing
Never happy are you Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
Of course I'm not happy. You expect us to just hop into bed with you? You are the enemy! You always have been, and you always will be! We will have no part in this.~|~translationMissing
Come now, don't be so hasty. You should at least think things over. While you do, I would appreciate a private chat with Safalaan.~|~translationMissing
Yes, you. Join me by the large mausoleum at the back of the graveyard. There is something we need to discuss.~|~translationMissing
What makes you think we're just going to let you walk off with him?~|~translationMissing
This is growing boringly repetitive, Veliaf. For the last time, if I wanted any of you dead, I'd have done it by now.~|~translationMissing
It's alright Veliaf. I will go.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Well [player name] has to go with you. I want him there in case Vanescula here tries anything.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Safalaan, [player name], if you'll please join me.~|~translationMissing
The meeting ends.~|~translationMissing
Safalaan Hallow. Interesting name, isn't it?~|~translationMissing
The name 'Hallow'. Do you know where it comes from?~|~translationMissing
It's common in these parts. They say it was the name of the old Saradominist rulers.~|~translationMissing
Spot on. You know your history. The family of icyene that ruled over Hallowvale were the Hallow family. And so of course, the name of the region is no coincidence.~|~translationMissing
I'm surprised your brother didn't have it renamed 'Drakanvale'.~|~translationMissing
Good name, but not really his style I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
What's your game, Vanescula? Why do you care about my name?~|~translationMissing
Do you not find it odd that you share a name with the former royal family?~|~translationMissing
No, I don't. Like I say, around here the name is pretty ordinary.~|~translationMissing
Ah, but you are far from ordinary, aren't you Safalaan? Tell me, how much do you remember of your childhood?~|~translationMissing
Nothing. I remember nothing of my childhood. You can thank your friend Vanstrom for that. He always wanted me dead, even back before the Myreque were a thing. One day he nearly succeeded.~|~translationMissing
But your powers stopped him?~|~translationMissing
You know about Safalaan's powers?~|~translationMissing
I know many things about Safalaan. It's why we are here, in fact. But please, go on.~|~translationMissing
It's why we're here? What do you mean? What is all this?~|~translationMissing
Finish your story. I promise that everything will be made clear.~|~translationMissing
Fine, but it's starting to seem like you already know everything anyway.~|~translationMissing
You're right about my powers. I was able to use them to drive Vanstrom away. It came at a cost though.~|~translationMissing
I remember nothing of the event, nor of anything that happened in my life before it. The only thing I remembered was my name.~|~translationMissing
There, story told. Now, tell me, why are we having this conversation?~|~translationMissing
This graveyard is no normal graveyard. It was once the private graveyard of the Hallow family. Every member of the royal family was buried here.~|~translationMissing
When she was still in power, the ruler of Hallowvale, Queen Efaritay Hallow, had this mausoleum built. It was constructed to one day house her and her human husband, King Ascertes Hallow.~|~translationMissing
Inside, I believe you will find the truth that you've spent your whole life searching for.~|~translationMissing
Stop with these games! If you know something, tell me!~|~translationMissing
Would you actually believe me if I did? To you, my words are just that, words. Inside this mausoleum lies something far more reliable, proof.~|~translationMissing
Well noted. We'll need to unlock it.~|~translationMissing
I bet I can get it open.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful. It's an interesting lock. The icyene always were devious. From what I can tell, you'll need to ensure that the total value of each row and column matches the number at the end.~|~translationMissing
Now, off you go.~|~translationMissing
Any luck with the lock, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Try to hurry. I don't like these games that Vanescula is playing.~|~translationMissing
You need to get this door open. From what I can tell, you'll need to ensure that the total value of each row and column on the lock matches the number at the end.~|~translationMissing
Keep an eye on Safalaan, [player name]. I don't like leaving him alone with that vampyre.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. You need to be over with Safalaan and Vanescula. We'll talk later.~|~translationMissing
Best we don't talk right now, [player name]. You need to be watching Safalaan and Vanescula and I don't want to distract you.~|~translationMissing
Shouldn't you be with Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, I'd better go to him.~|~translationMissing
Now's not the time for chat, [player name]. You're meant to be watching Safalaan and Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
You should be keeping an eye on Safalaan and Vanescula. We will talk later.~|~translationMissing
There's a plaque on the coffin.~|~translationMissing
It reads~|~translationMissing
'Here lies Larina Hallow. Beloved daughter of Efaritay and Ascertes Hallow and...'~|~translationMissing
'...and faithful sister of Safalaan Hallow.'~|~translationMissing
I... I don't...~|~translationMissing
No! It can't be true! It can't be!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry Safalaan, but it is true. You are the half- human, half-icyene son of Queen Efaritay Hallow.~|~translationMissing
A sister... I had a sister. And my powers?~|~translationMissing
The powers of an icyene, yes.~|~translationMissing
But... I don't understand...~|~translationMissing
I realise it's a lot to take in.~|~translationMissing
No. What I mean is, you said that this tomb was built for Efaritay and Ascertes, for my mother and father. But they're not here.~|~translationMissing
Where are they Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
Safalaan I...~|~translationMissing
No! No more games! I know why you've done this. You don't care for me. You're just trying to manipulate me!~|~translationMissing
Well fine, it worked. If you want my support in killing your brother, you will have it. But you must tell me, where are my parents?~|~translationMissing
The war for this land was long and bloody. We were winning, but with heavy losses. Lowerniel didn't mind. He was a hunter and a warrior. In his eyes, there was no death more noble than one in battle.~|~translationMissing
Many didn't share that view though, and wanted the war to be over. Ranis was one of them. He managed to infiltrate Efaritay's castle. Once inside, he captured your father, Ascertes.~|~translationMissing
Efaritay surrendered that same day. She walked into Lowerniel's camp, alone, and willingly handed herself in. I guess she had hoped that Lowerniel would free your father in exchange for her.~|~translationMissing
But he didn't, did he?~|~translationMissing
No. After that, I'm afraid I don't know what happened to your mother. No one ever saw her again. Only Lowerniel himself knows her fate.~|~translationMissing
And my father?~|~translationMissing
Like I said, we suffered heavy losses in the war. We needed a way to quickly restore our numbers. Vampyrification was the answer. Your father was the first of many to go through the process.~|~translationMissing
You turned him into a vampyre? You monsters!~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel turned him into a vampyre, not I.~|~translationMissing
But you were there, by his side. Do you expect me to believe that you're not just like him?~|~translationMissing
I can't control what you believe, but I am not the enemy here.~|~translationMissing
What happened then? After you had your way with him, what became of my father?~|~translationMissing
He still lives to this day, under a different name of course.~|~translationMissing
What name? Tell me!~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom Klause.~|~translationMissing
No! You're lying! You said it yourself earlier, I have no reason to believe you!~|~translationMissing
Everything I have told you is the truth. Only you can decide if you want to believe it.~|~translationMissing
Safalaan...~|~translationMissing
My family...~|~translationMissing
Alright Vanescula, you win. If you want Lowerniel dead, you will have the support of the Myreque. I ask only one thing.~|~translationMissing
When the time comes, I will be the one to kill him. He will pay for what he has done to me and my family.~|~translationMissing
So be it. You should inform the rest of your group.~|~translationMissing
[player name], I need some time to think over what we have discovered here. Please, inform the others for me.~|~translationMissing
Now, both of you leave. I need some time alone.~|~translationMissing
No. You need to tell your companions about Safalaan's decision. Now, get going.~|~translationMissing
Myreque prevail, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Myreque prevail, Vertida.~|~translationMissing
I saw you head into that mausoleum with Safalaan and Vanescula. What's going on?~|~translationMissing
Turns out this graveyard is more than just a quiet meeting place. That mausoleum contained the truth behind Safalaan's heritage.~|~translationMissing
Truth? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
Safalaan is the only living child of Efaritay Hallow, the former queen of Hallowvale.~|~translationMissing
By Saradomin!~|~translationMissing
Is he okay? That's quite the sudden discovery.~|~translationMissing
He wishes to be alone. In the meantime, he asked me to speak to everyone.~|~translationMissing
He's agreed to work with her, hasn't he?~|~translationMissing
How did you know?~|~translationMissing
I know what he's like. I've known Safalaan longer than anyone. When Vanstrom attacked him and he lost his memory, I was the one that found him.~|~translationMissing
Well, if Safalaan wants to work with Vanescula, then he has my support.~|~translationMissing
Oh. That was easy. I was expecting you to disagree with him.~|~translationMissing
I trust Safalaan. He's made some mistakes, sure. But he's a good leader and I know he won't have made this choice lightly. Tell him he has my support all the way on this.~|~translationMissing
Alright, thanks Vertida.~|~translationMissing
Have you spoken to the others about the plan?~|~translationMissing
I'm doing that now.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll let you get back to it then.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I hope Vanescula isn't causing trouble.~|~translationMissing
Not yet she isn't. In fact, Safalaan has decided he wants to work with her.~|~translationMissing
He does? Why?~|~translationMissing
She showed him the truth about his family. That seemed to convince him.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. I fear she is trying to manipulate him.~|~translationMissing
So you don't agree with his decision?~|~translationMissing
Vanescula does not strike me as someone that fails to consider every detail of a plan. However, you must have spotted the clear holes in this scheme to kill her brother.~|~translationMissing
Her plan detailed getting us in and killing her brother. But there was no mention of getting us out again. We'll have just killed the ruler of Morytania. To the vampyres, we'll be public enemy number one.~|~translationMissing
If you ask me, I reckon that Vanescula will kill us all as soon as her brother is out of the picture.~|~translationMissing
So you don't support the plan?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. Killing Lowerniel Drakan is no victory at all if he just gets replaced with his sister. Especially if it results in our demise.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. I'll see what the others think.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I was wondering if you'd changed your mind about working with Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
Well maybe it doesn't have to. Radigad has a plan of his own. He thinks that once her brother is dead, we should kill Vanescula as well.~|~translationMissing
An interesting proposal. Do you think we can do it?~|~translationMissing
If we can kill Lowerniel, we can kill her. He's meant to be the most powerful vampyre around.~|~translationMissing
A fair point. And I guess if we can't kill Lowerniel, what does it matter at that point. We'll all be dead.~|~translationMissing
A pleasant thought. So, are you still against the plan?~|~translationMissing
I still fear it's a trap. But perhaps our best move now is to spring that trap. You've convinced me. I will support Safalaan.~|~translationMissing
Great, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Have you convinced the others to work with Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
Well keep at it.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. I've been pondering what Vanescula told us about Calsidiu.~|~translationMissing
I understand why Veliaf lied at the time. We were on the brink of defeat. Without a bit of hope, we'd have probably never made it to this point.~|~translationMissing
But I don't think we need that false hope any more. Now, we have real hope. Ranis Drakan is dead! Ranis Drakan! He was Lowerniel Drakan's own brother!~|~translationMissing
If Ranis can die, so can the rest. Lowerniel's days are numbered.~|~translationMissing
So you're not angry at Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
No. He did what he believed was right. In the end, that's all any of us can do.~|~translationMissing
Well on that note, how do you feel about Vanescula's plan?~|~translationMissing
It's dangerous, but so what? We're the Myreque, danger is what we do. I say we go for it.~|~translationMissing
It seems you're not alone with that sentiment. Safalaan wishes to work with Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
You have my support [player name]. It's Veliaf you need to convince.~|~translationMissing
I guess I'd better talk to him then.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. Any luck with Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
He can't say no forever. If everyone else is on board, he'll have to agree.~|~translationMissing
Let's hope so. Talk later Ivan.~|~translationMissing
[player name]. How goes it?~|~translationMissing
Safalaan has decided he wants to work with Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
Has he now? A good decision if you ask me.~|~translationMissing
You think so?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. Here's how I see it. Vanescula is right, we can't kill her brother without her help.~|~translationMissing
I feel like there's a 'but' coming on.~|~translationMissing
But... once the deed is done, we don't have any further need of her. We kill her as well and Morytania is finally free of that wretched family.~|~translationMissing
You heard what she said. If we kill her another vampyre could just take her place.~|~translationMissing
Well of course she said that. She needs us to believe that we need her, otherwise her whole plan is done for.~|~translationMissing
Think about it. Lowerniel Drakan is supposedly the most powerful vampyre in existence. What vampyre would dare cross the humans that killed him?~|~translationMissing
You make a fair point. I take it your happy to work with Vanescula then?~|~translationMissing
Of course! Let's rid Morytania of evil, once and for all!~|~translationMissing
I'm still working to convince the others to work with Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
You should let them know my plan. I bet that will convince some of them.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. Thanks Radigad.~|~translationMissing
And you, Kael. I wanted to talk to you about Vanescula's plan.~|~translationMissing
Appears risky to me, friend. Vampyres are the enemy and she is a vampyre.~|~translationMissing
We take risks every day though, don't we?~|~translationMissing
We do. But some we take because we have to, others because we choose to.~|~translationMissing
We took an unnecessary risk back in Meiyerditch with Serafina. Look how that turned out. Flaygian, Mekritus and Andiess. All dead because of that risk.~|~translationMissing
Were you close to them?~|~translationMissing
Flaygian and Mekritus? Not particularly. They were good men, and it was sad to lose them, but we were not close.~|~translationMissing
Now, Andiess on the other hand, he and I grew up together. Before Safalaan found us, he was all I had. But now he's gone and nothing I do will ever bring him back.~|~translationMissing
Do you blame Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
No. He could not have known what would happen. But that doesn't mean we should take more unnecessary risks.~|~translationMissing
This could be our only chance to kill Lowerniel Drakan. Surely that makes the risk necessary?~|~translationMissing
I want to believe that, I really do. I just don't know if I'm ready to lose any more friends.~|~translationMissing
I can't promise there won't be losses. But what of the losses we've already suffered? If we don't kill Lowerniel Drakan, surely they were all for nothing?~|~translationMissing
I... I guess you're right. Okay then, I'm in. Let's kill him, for Andiess, and for everyone else who's suffered because of him.~|~translationMissing
He'll regret the day he crossed the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
I'd better not disturb you. You need to tell the others about the plan.~|~translationMissing
Well met. Tell me, what's Vanescula up to with Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
Turns out Vanescula knows a lot about Safalaan. More than he knows about himself in fact.~|~translationMissing
That mausoleum contained the truth about Safalaan's family. He is the only surviving child of Hallowvale's queen, Efaritay Hallow.~|~translationMissing
No! It can't be!~|~translationMissing
Are you sure this isn't a trick? It could be a trap set by Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
Possibly, though I don't think so. It all adds up. What else could explain his strange abilities?~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I guess it does fit.~|~translationMissing
That's not the only thing. Vanescula told us that Safalaan's father still lives, but as a vampyre. Vanstrom Klause.~|~translationMissing
Those monsters! How has Safalaan taken this?~|~translationMissing
As well as can be expected. However, he has decided it's best that we work with Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
What? This is a bad idea! She is a vampyre, we can't trust her.~|~translationMissing
So you won't work with her?~|~translationMissing
No. I'm sorry, but no. She's trying to manipulate Safalaan but I see through her lies. I can't support this.~|~translationMissing
Hello Veliaf. Have you thought any more about working with Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
There is no more thinking to do. The answer is still no.~|~translationMissing
You know, all the others have agreed to the plan. It's just you.~|~translationMissing
All of them? But why?~|~translationMissing
They all have their reasons. They all seem valid reasons to me.~|~translationMissing
But they must know that we can't trust Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
I think they know that. We do not necessarily need to trust her to work with her.~|~translationMissing
Damn it. I don't want to work with her, but I have no intention of abandoning the others to their fate. Fine. Looks like we all get to die together.~|~translationMissing
Come. I guess we should tell that vampyre that we're in.~|~translationMissing
Well Vanescula, it seems you have managed to convince us. Well done.~|~translationMissing
Thank you Veliaf. Now, shall we crack on?~|~translationMissing
What must we do?~|~translationMissing
If you want any hope of defeating my brother, you'll need the proper weaponry.~|~translationMissing
We have weaponry. We have the Ivandis Flail.~|~translationMissing
Indeed you do. Not a bad weapon by any means, but not ideal for taking on Lowerniel. He'll snap it in two before you even have a chance to use it.~|~translationMissing
It worked well enough on Ranis.~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel is far more powerful than Ranis was. If you want to defeat him, you should take my advice.~|~translationMissing
Fine. What are you proposing?~|~translationMissing
If I'm not mistaken, which I'm generally not, you made that weapon using research from the Haemalchemy Laboratory.~|~translationMissing
How did you know that?~|~translationMissing
[player name], who was it that helped you find that laboratory?~|~translationMissing
Sarius Guile, your servant. Hang on... Did you send her?~|~translationMissing
Of course I did. Do you think she would have dared interact with you without my consent? Come now, surely you're smarter than that?~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I don't know much of the laboratory myself. It was Ranis that had it set up. Lowerniel wasn't very happy when he found out.~|~translationMissing
That said, I do suspect it might have more secrets for us to discover.~|~translationMissing
So you want us to go back there?~|~translationMissing
Yes. If you are able to find further research notes, I suspect we'll find a way to upgrade that weapon of yours.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'd better be off to the laboratory then.~|~translationMissing
I would like to join you, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Are you sure, Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Better I be out there doing something than be stuck here brooding.~|~translationMissing
[player name], do you remember how to reach the laboratory?~|~translationMissing
It's in sector six of Meiyerditch, just south east of the daeyalt mine.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I will meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Good luck to you both.~|~translationMissing
Keep an eye on Safalaan, won't you? I worry about how he's taking things.~|~translationMissing
I shall, fear not.~|~translationMissing
Good. Now you should head off to that laboratory. No point wasting time.~|~translationMissing
Be quick then.~|~translationMissing
You're meant to be searching the Haemalchemy Laboratory for more research. Run along now.~|~translationMissing
Why do you hate your brother?~|~translationMissing
How did Ranis capture Ascertes Hallow?~|~translationMissing
Why did Lowerniel shut down the Haemalchemy Laboratory?~|~translationMissing
Right, I'd better get going.~|~translationMissing
Why wouldn't I? He's an awful leader. My kind are slowly starving to death thanks to overpopulation, but he doesn't even seem to have noticed.~|~translationMissing
Is killing him not a bit much?~|~translationMissing
Not really. It is the vampyre way. There was once a time when things were far more savage. Back on our homeworld, new clan leaders were selected during a festival known as the Night of the Blood Moon.~|~translationMissing
It was a simple concept. A full night of killing. At dawn, the one with the most kills became the new leader. Lowerniel loved it. He won every time of course. Personally, I prefer our new way of life.~|~translationMissing
And yet you're still happy to kill him?~|~translationMissing
We are not the beasts we were back then, but some things do not change. Like I say, it is the vampyre way.~|~translationMissing
Now, did you want something else?~|~translationMissing
Do you know of Verzik Vitur?~|~translationMissing
Owner of the Theatre of Blood? Who doesn't know of her?~|~translationMissing
I'd give her the credit over Ranis. The two of them shared a love for playing with their food rather than eating it. They hatched all kinds of schemes together.~|~translationMissing
During the war, they managed to capture a justiciar, one of Efaritay's most elite warriors. They tortured him for days, until he gave them what they needed.~|~translationMissing
Which was?~|~translationMissing
A secret tunnel, leading directly into Efaritay's castle. The tunnel was here, in this very graveyard. Once they were inside, capturing Ascertes was easy.~|~translationMissing
In some ways, I think Lowerniel was a bit disappointed the fighting was over. The pair were still greatly rewarded, however. Verzik ended up getting Efaritay's castle. It was quite the boon for her.~|~translationMissing
I can only assume he didn't like what they were doing there.~|~translationMissing
Well obviously. Could you be more specific though?~|~translationMissing
Are you familiar with their areas of research?~|~translationMissing
Ways to overcome blood shortages and ways to improve your immunity to our weapons.~|~translationMissing
Essentially. The first might seem to benefit Lowerniel, but when you look deeper you can see why he wasn't a fan.~|~translationMissing
For our kind to be less reliant on humans would be a fundamental change to our society. History has told us that leaders generally don't survive such a transition.~|~translationMissing
As for the second, I think it's obvious why Lowerniel wanted to put a stop to that. Just ask Ranis why that research maybe wasn't overly wise.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Of course, Lowerniel's long absences mean that a lot of research was already complete before the laboratory was shut down. Hence how you were able to use it against Ranis.~|~translationMissing
Which we were only able to do because of you. Why did you send Sarius to us?~|~translationMissing
A test. Even back then I knew that Lowerniel needed to go. I wanted to see if a partnership with the Myreque was worth exploring.~|~translationMissing
Meet me at the laboratory, friend. Let's see what we can discover.~|~translationMissing
These are dark times friend.~|~translationMissing
They are. But maybe there's a light at the end of the tunnel.~|~translationMissing
Maybe. I guess we'll find out soon enough. Be careful out there.~|~translationMissing
And you.~|~translationMissing
We'll soon be doing battle with one of the most powerful beings in existence. How are you feeling?~|~translationMissing
I'm okay. How about you?~|~translationMissing
Surprisingly calm, to be honest. We may well die in this fight, but if we manage to defeat Drakan, it will be worth it.~|~translationMissing
I guess it's not a bad way to go.~|~translationMissing
Imagine, the death of Lowerniel Drakan. Think what that could do to these dark lands.~|~translationMissing
It's crazy to think it might actually happen.~|~translationMissing
We've come a long way. Just one final hurdle.~|~translationMissing
And then, peace in our time.~|~translationMissing
Let us hope, let us hope.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. Looks like it's really happening. We're finally going to show Drakan what happens when you cross the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Looks like it. How are you feeling?~|~translationMissing
Oh I'm great. I know we can do this, especially with you on our side.~|~translationMissing
I hope you're right to have faith in me.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I know you won't let us down.~|~translationMissing
Do you think we're ready for this?~|~translationMissing
The fight with Drakan? Yes, I think so. We killed Ranis after all.~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel's a much bigger fish though.~|~translationMissing
He is. But it's not just me this time. This time there's all of us. And Vanescula too, assuming she doesn't betray us.~|~translationMissing
Let us hope.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you, [player name]. Glad you made it here safely.~|~translationMissing
And you. How are you doing?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I'm not sure if I've even properly taken it in yet. It's all so much. My mother, my sister... and of course, my father.~|~translationMissing
It feels strange. I feel like I should mourn, but how do I mourn a family I can't even remember?~|~translationMissing
And Vanstrom... My greatest enemy may well be my only remaining family. I wonder, is there anything left of Ascertes now? Is part of him still in there, buried away?~|~translationMissing
Probably best not thinking about, I suppose. My job is to lead the Myreque. I can't let anything else distract me from that, not even my family.~|~translationMissing
With all that's happened, I fear some of them may already be beginning to doubt me.~|~translationMissing
You have their support Safalaan, I know you do.~|~translationMissing
I hope so. I let them down with that Serafina business, and people died. I can't let them down again.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, let us crack on. It seems that we should be able to access more of the laboratory through the doors to the south.~|~translationMissing
They were damaged and couldn't be opened, but I think I've managed to fix them up.~|~translationMissing
I didn't know you had a knack for Construction?~|~translationMissing
Ah, one of my hidden talents. Of course, not much room for that sort of thing around here.~|~translationMissing
That's a shame. I'm sure you'd make a great builder.~|~translationMissing
Ha! It's strange to think how differently our lives could have been, is it not? Alas, here we are.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry. Maybe now isn't the best time for these kinds of conversations.~|~translationMissing
You have a good sense of humour my friend, even in these dark times. Do not be ashamed of that. When things are darkest, a bit of light is very welcome.~|~translationMissing
Shall we get going then?~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Let's head in.~|~translationMissing
Look out!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan is attacked by a mutated bloodveld~|~translationMissing
Well just let me know when you're ready to go in.~|~translationMissing
Shall we head in?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I need to prepare first.~|~translationMissing
Well just let me know when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Are you alright Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
I... I'm fine. What happened?~|~translationMissing
We were attacked by some bloodvelds. You used your powers to kill one.~|~translationMissing
Blasted powers! What good are powers when I have no control over them?~|~translationMissing
Don't be so harsh on yourself. Your powers have got us out of a couple of sticky situations now.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but what happens if I totally lose control? Will I lose my memory like that time with Vanstrom? Or will I do something even worse?~|~translationMissing
Well now that we know the source of your powers, maybe we can find a way to help you control them.~|~translationMissing
Maybe... Let us hope we can do so before it's too late.~|~translationMissing
Bah, look at me, [player name]. I'm meant to be a leader, but I can barely control my own body. I'm like an old man.~|~translationMissing
Well... you are the son of Queen Efaritay. I guess that makes you thousands of years old.~|~translationMissing
Eugh, what an awful thought. I guess I should get myself a walking stick.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure we can arrange that.~|~translationMissing
Let's add it to the list. First though, the research we came here for. I'm afraid I'm still feeling a bit weak, so you'll have to do the heavy lifting on this one.~|~translationMissing
Oh I see how it is! You find out you're an old-timer and now I have to do all the work!~|~translationMissing
Afraid so. My poor back simply can't take it. I've no doubt you'll manage though.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll have a look round and see what I can find. You stay here, old-timer.~|~translationMissing
Please stop calling me that.~|~translationMissing
I can make no promises.~|~translationMissing
Do you think we can kill Drakan?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I don't know. They say he's the most powerful being in existence. The truth is though, we know pretty much nothing about him.~|~translationMissing
I guess the point is that we're in the best position possible. If we can't kill him, I suspect no one can.~|~translationMissing
We seem to be dealing with a lot of uncertainties.~|~translationMissing
Oh we are. But you play the hand you're dealt, my friend. This is our hand.~|~translationMissing
I guess. Losing a card game generally doesn't result in death though.~|~translationMissing
You should try playing against a werewolf.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
Could we talk more about your family?~|~translationMissing
I don't trust her. She feigned affection back at the graveyard. But I know she's just doing it for her own gain.~|~translationMissing
You still chose to work with her though.~|~translationMissing
Yes. She is our only hope of defeating her brother. In truth, I'd pretty much made my choice even before she told me about my family.~|~translationMissing
That's good to know. I worried you were being too hasty after you discovered the truth.~|~translationMissing
You are not wrong to worry, friend. I may well be leading us to certain death.~|~translationMissing
Well you have our support. For better or worse.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I appreciate it, especially from you. As an outsider, you could easily turn and run at any time. The fact that you're still here speaks volumes.~|~translationMissing
Not now.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry. I know you must have so many questions. I have plenty myself. But I need to focus right now and cannot be distracted by such thoughts.~|~translationMissing
We will talk later. You have my word.~|~translationMissing
Alright there old-timer?~|~translationMissing
I'm starting to regret praising your humour.~|~translationMissing
You need to try and find some more haemalchemy research. There must be something of note around here.~|~translationMissing
You find a book of haemalchemy research on the bookshelf.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I found some more haemalchemy research.~|~translationMissing
Good work. I'll look after it for you.~|~translationMissing
You give the book of haemalchemy research to Safalaan.~|~translationMissing
Right. We'd better get back to the graveyard. I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll see you soon.~|~translationMissing
I'm going to keep hold of it.~|~translationMissing
Come now, [player name]. We need that research. Please give it to me as soon as you can.~|~translationMissing
We should get back to the graveyard. I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Still here Ivan?~|~translationMissing
Yup. Most of the others went to the Meiyerditch hideout. But I wanted to stick around.~|~translationMissing
This graveyard is one of the last remaining examples of what Hallowvale was like. I bet there's a lot to discover here.~|~translationMissing
Maybe once Drakan is gone, we can get some proper archaeologists out here. I'm sure they could learn all sorts.~|~translationMissing
I bet they could. You holding up okay?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. We're going to win this, I know it.~|~translationMissing
You seem very confident?~|~translationMissing
Why wouldn't I be? I have faith in Saradomin. I have faith in Safalaan and Veliaf. I have faith in you. Together, we will beat Drakan.~|~translationMissing
I do hope so.~|~translationMissing
Have faith, friend. Anyway, I'd best let you get on.~|~translationMissing
Take care Ivan.~|~translationMissing
...of your arrogance. What makes you so sure we won't also kill you once your brother is dead?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you could try. Although I doubt it would end well for you.~|~translationMissing
Now this is exactly what I mean.~|~translationMissing
Oh lighten up would you. No sense of humour at all.~|~translationMissing
I am no fool. I am all too aware of my own weaknesses and how you could exploit them. When we take on Lowerniel, I don't intend to be alone.~|~translationMissing
I have many supporters amongst the vampyres of Darkmeyer. Your small group against all of us? The fight would be brief.~|~translationMissing
Hiding behind larger numbers? Not very honourable.~|~translationMissing
Now you see, I've tried honour before. Decided it wasn't for me. Honour matters not if you're dead. I intend to keep living.~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name], you're back. Good to see you made it okay.~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes. Wonderful to see you. Shall we get on with things?~|~translationMissing
Well, the research you recovered has confirmed something I have long suspected.~|~translationMissing
Queen Efaritay was a renowned botanist. She used this to her advantage many times during the war, breeding all kinds of plant life to use against us.~|~translationMissing
One of these plants was the Blisterwood tree. The icyene used the sap of this tree to create poisons that were deadly to vampyres.~|~translationMissing
However, I've always suspected the tree might have other uses. Clearly the researchers in the Haemalchemy Laboratory thought the same.~|~translationMissing
So what did they find out?~|~translationMissing
It seems that the bark of the Blisterwood tree can be used to create weapons that are deadly to my kind.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm no scientist, oddly enough. But from what I can tell, even when chopped away, the wood of the tree is very much alive. It shifts and grows in unpredictable ways, rendering our immunities useless.~|~translationMissing
I see where we're going with this. You want us to use this tree to construct new weapons?~|~translationMissing
Well... not quite. While not perfect, the work you've already done has potential. I see no need to completely discard it.~|~translationMissing
Instead, I suggest we use wood from the Blisterwood tree to enhance the weapons you already have. When combined with the wood, I imagine that flail of yours will be quite effective.~|~translationMissing
Perfect for killing your brother. Assuming you don't kill us first.~|~translationMissing
Again with this? I've already told you, I have no need to kill you. Once Lowerniel is gone, I envisage a new age, where my kind and yours live in harmony. I need you alive for that.~|~translationMissing
I'll believe it when I see it.~|~translationMissing
That's fine by me.~|~translationMissing
We're getting sidetracked here. We need some wood from this Blisterwood tree. Where do we find it?~|~translationMissing
Ah... that's the tricky bit. I know only of one Blisterwood tree. It lies in Efaritay's old Arboretum, in the middle of Darkmeyer.~|~translationMissing
It's in the capital? We'll have no hope of getting in there.~|~translationMissing
I don't see why we'd need to. Vanescula here can get some of this wood for us.~|~translationMissing
Really now? Do you think I have any intention of touching a tree that can kill vampyres? No. You will need to recover the wood yourself.~|~translationMissing
Darkmeyer isn't as impenetrable as you might think. I know of a way you can get in. But first, you'll need a disguise.~|~translationMissing
Now, luckily for us, my kind have some shapeshifting abilities. Many vampyres, such as myself, prefer to take on a human form. That means you should be able to fit in... with the right outfit of course.~|~translationMissing
Trader Sven sells vyrewatch disguises. We've used them in the past.~|~translationMissing
Not bad, but we'll want to make some adjustments. We need you looking less like a vyrewatch and more like a noble.~|~translationMissing
Polmafi knows how to use a needle. He should be able to sort us out.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. [player name], could you pick up a vyrewatch disguise from Trader Sven? He lives in sector one of Meiyerditch, directly south of Old Man Ral's house.~|~translationMissing
Will do. I'm guessing I should take it to Polmafi after that?~|~translationMissing
That's right. He and the others have gone back to the Meiyerditch hideout, in Old Man Ral's basement.~|~translationMissing
Once you have the disguise, we will need to scent it. We will discuss that once you have it.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back when I have the disguise.~|~translationMissing
You should get going friend. That disguise won't sort itself out.~|~translationMissing
Go and buy a vyrewatch disguise from Trader Sven. His house is the one directly south of Old Man Ral's, in sector one of Meiyerditch.~|~translationMissing
And once I have the disguise?~|~translationMissing
Deliver it to Polmafi at the Meiyerditch hideout, in Old Man Ral's basement.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I shall return later.~|~translationMissing
You're meant to be working with Polmafi to create a suitable disguise. Now, off you go.~|~translationMissing
I need to look like a vampyre noble. Safalaan suggested we use a vyrewatch disguise from Trader Sven as a starting point.~|~translationMissing
That's a good idea. Do you have a vyrewatch disguise with you?~|~translationMissing
Great. Hand it over and I'll get to work.~|~translationMissing
You give Polmafi the vyrewatch disguise.~|~translationMissing
Here's your finished disguise. Be careful out there.~|~translationMissing
Polmafi gives you a finished vyre noble disguise.~|~translationMissing
There was enough material for some spares. I'll leave them in the chest in the corner in case you need more.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep it for now.~|~translationMissing
Well I can't make your new disguise until you give it to me.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you [player name]. How are things going?~|~translationMissing
Not too bad. We've managed to recover some more haemalchemy research. We think it can be used to further improve our weaponry.~|~translationMissing
Well that's good to hear. Anything I can help with?~|~translationMissing
Yes, actually. To make the improved weapons, I need to infiltrate the city of Darkmeyer. For that, I need a disguise. Veliaf said you'd be able to help.~|~translationMissing
The city of Darkmeyer? Oh my! You'd better be careful.~|~translationMissing
Anyhow, yes I should be able to help. What kind of disguise do you need?~|~translationMissing
Do you mind fetching one?~|~translationMissing
Sure. I'll see if I can get one from Trader Sven.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Do you have a vyrewatch disguise yet?~|~translationMissing
I'll be here once you have.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the disguise?~|~translationMissing
Well we can't go any further then. Return once you have it.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful. Now, as mentioned earlier, we will need to scent this disguise. My kind have a keen sense of smell and will quickly notice an imposter if they don't smell right.~|~translationMissing
What do we need to scent it with?~|~translationMissing
Blood of course. The blood of a vyre.~|~translationMissing
So I kill a vyrewatch and use their blood to scent the disguise?~|~translationMissing
Oh... no, no, no. A vyrewatch will not do. We want you to blend in with the nobles. That means we need the blood of a noble.~|~translationMissing
There's a difference?~|~translationMissing
Of course. The lords and ladies of Darkmeyer won't go interacting with any old rabble.~|~translationMissing
Of course. Go on then, give us some of your blood.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear Veliaf, you misunderstand. The smell of my blood will be far too recognisable to work. We need someone a bit more obscure.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, how silly of me to not realise. You clearly have a vampyre in mind. Spit it out.~|~translationMissing
I think we use this as an opportunity to deal with two issues in one. Damien Leucurte has become a problem that needs to be resolved. He is also a noble, albeit a lesser one.~|~translationMissing
So we kill Damien and use his blood. Sounds good to me.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Let's get it done. [player name], meet me outside the church in Slepe. We're going to pay Damien a little visit.~|~translationMissing
If you want, you can use the boat to quickly get to Slepe. Should be faster than walking.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. Veliaf, I'll see you there.~|~translationMissing
Meet me outside the church in Slepe. We're going to pay Damien a little visit.~|~translationMissing
You should meet up with Veliaf in Slepe. We'll talk later.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Until then.~|~translationMissing
You need to kill Damien Leucurte and use his blood to scent your disguise. Run along now.~|~translationMissing
Well met friend. Didn't think we'd be back here so soon.~|~translationMissing
I know. Not a bad thing though. Damien needs to be dealt with.~|~translationMissing
I suppose you're right. Now, I've done some scouting. It seems Damien is hiding in the manor. Interestingly, he doesn't seem to have increased his security since Kroy's death.~|~translationMissing
He may well have tried, but I bet we scared off a lot of his supporters.~|~translationMissing
They don't want to mess with you my friend. I suspect you're becoming quite notorious amongst the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
Do you think we should be able to access the manor easily?~|~translationMissing
Looks like it. I think we can get in through the dungeon. Let me know when you're ready and we'll head on in.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the vyre disguise~|~translationMissing
The player and Veliaf go off to confront Damien~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the vyre disguise~|~translationMissing
Oh wait! I forgot the disguise!~|~translationMissing
Well you'd better go and get it. I'll be here when you are ready.~|~translationMissing
Do you think Safalaan is doing okay?~|~translationMissing
You tell me. You've spent more time with him since his discovery.~|~translationMissing
He seems to be okay. At least, as okay as anyone could be in that situation. He seems to still be focused, and he's not lost his sense of humour.~|~translationMissing
Maintaining a good sense of humour is common coping mechanism when dealing with shock. I hope he's not just putting on a facade. If he's struggling, he should seek our support.~|~translationMissing
You're not wrong. But that's for him to decide. He knows we are there if he needs us.~|~translationMissing
It's good that he has people like you. I may have known him a long time, but I can't pretend to be any good at comforting people in such situations. I never manage to say the right thing.~|~translationMissing
And you think I do?~|~translationMissing
You can't be any worse than me. I'd take that as a victory.~|~translationMissing
Do you think things will improve for him?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. He may well soon come face to face with Lowerniel Drakan, the cause of all his pain. I hope he is ready for that.~|~translationMissing
And then there's Vanstrom, of course. Their paths are likely to cross again before all this is over. And when that happens, who knows what the outcome will be.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, are you ready to deal with Damien?~|~translationMissing
How are you feeling about working with Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
Well, she hasn't killed us yet, which I consider a win. It seems she spoke the truth about wanting her brother dead.~|~translationMissing
Of course, I still fully expect her to betray us once he's gone.~|~translationMissing
But you're still willing to go ahead with this?~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't say I'm 'willing' as such, but what other choice do I have? The others want to do it and I'll be damned if I'm just going to leave them to their fates.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't mean I haven't been considering contingencies, of course. I've asked Ivan to prepare us a teleport spell in case we need to make a hasty exit.~|~translationMissing
Seems sensible to me. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. But enough about Vanescula. Are you ready to deal with Damien?~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to deal with Damien?~|~translationMissing
So here you are. I knew it was only a matter of time before you lot showed up.~|~translationMissing
We'd hate to disappoint. It's over Damien.~|~translationMissing
Listen to your arrogance! Is this what we've become? I remember when we commanded respect. Your kind would cower in fear at the sight of us!~|~translationMissing
Once, yes. But now, we are not the ones cowering.~|~translationMissing
You think I'm afraid? I am a lord of Darkmeyer. I am fear!~|~translationMissing
A lord of Darkmeyer? Isn't a lord meant to have followers? Looks like yours have run away.~|~translationMissing
Cowards! That's what they are. I was their saviour! When our great leaders abandoned us, I was the one that kept them fed!~|~translationMissing
And now you're nothing.~|~translationMissing
Face it Damien, you're out of time. There's nowhere to run.~|~translationMissing
That is true for all of us!~|~translationMissing
Time to see what you're really made of!~|~translationMissing
Crombwick! You will support me!~|~translationMissing
Lord Crombwick~|~translationMissing
What? But I can't...~|~translationMissing
You can and you will!~|~translationMissing
Come on then! This ends now!~|~translationMissing
Damien attacks the player and Veliaf~|~translationMissing
As Damien dies, you use his blood to scent your disguise.~|~translationMissing
Got what you need?~|~translationMissing
Looks like it.~|~translationMissing
Good. I don't want to stick around this place any longer than needed. I will meet you back at the graveyard.~|~translationMissing
What do you think this means for Slepe?~|~translationMissing
The death of Damien can't do any harm. That said, don't expect this to suddenly fix everything around here. The Sleeper Plague isn't the only illness in this town.~|~translationMissing
You mean their religion?~|~translationMissing
I do. The people here chose to follow Zamorak. A choice like that has consequences. Bad ones.~|~translationMissing
You think they are being punished?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly. I don't believe in fate myself. I'm sure someone like Drezel would say otherwise, though. I just think that if you play with fire, you're going to end up getting burnt.~|~translationMissing
So do you think the Sleeper Plague will go away now?~|~translationMissing
Well there shouldn't be any new cases now that Damien and Kroy are gone. That won't help those already infected though.~|~translationMissing
Maybe there's a cure.~|~translationMissing
Maybe. I suspect this town holds a lot of secrets... but now is not the time to explore them. We have other business to attend to.~|~translationMissing
I'll see you at the graveyard.~|~translationMissing
I'll see you there~|~translationMissing
No need for us to stick around this place any more. I will meet you back at the graveyard.~|~translationMissing
I sent some of Damien's blood to Polmafi. Speak to him if you need a replacement disguise.~|~translationMissing
Well well, the vampyre slayer returns. Two of my brothers, now Damien as well. Quite the body count you're amassing.~|~translationMissing
Two of your brothers?~|~translationMissing
Did you not know? [player name] here isn't just responsible for killing Ranis. He also killed our younger brother, Draynor.~|~translationMissing
Count Draynor, he called himself. He wasn't much of a challenge compared to Ranis and Damien, truth be told.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the great 'Count' Draynor. He loved his stupid titles. He was weak even before he got trapped on the wrong side of the Salve. A coward as well.~|~translationMissing
There's a reason Lowerniel had him banished. I'm just surprised he lasted as long as he did.~|~translationMissing
Now, I assume you have a finished disguise?~|~translationMissing
Wonderful. Now we're getting somewhere. With that disguise, you should be ready to enter Darkmeyer.~|~translationMissing
But how does he get into the city? The place is a fortress.~|~translationMissing
Almost, but not quite. I know of a small weakness in the southern wall. A crack, in sector six of Meiyerditch, just north of the daeyalt mine.~|~translationMissing
It should be big enough for you to squeeze through, as long as you haven't recently eaten an excess of cakes.~|~translationMissing
Seems suspiciously convenient. Why hasn't the crack been filled in?~|~translationMissing
My kind are struggling to feed themselves. They've currently got bigger worries than cracks in walls.~|~translationMissing
Besides, up until now, why would any human even consider entering Darkmeyer? Perhaps you hadn't noticed, my kind is not known for treating humans well.~|~translationMissing
Although you expect us to live in harmony once this is done. How are we meant to achieve that when each side hates the other?~|~translationMissing
I never said it would be easy. I don't expect us to kill my brother and then have a big party. It will be work, but given time, that work will pay off.~|~translationMissing
So that aside, I can use this crack to enter Darkmeyer? What then?~|~translationMissing
You'll need to get to Efaritay's Arboretum in the middle of the city. The city architects gave it facelift to help it blend in, but it's still impossible to miss.~|~translationMissing
Once inside, you'll need to chop some logs from the Blisterwood tree. We'll need enough to arm everyone, so eight logs in total.~|~translationMissing
Now, whatever happens, you must not let your true identity be exposed. If a member of the Myreque was found in Darkmeyer, the entire city would be locked down.~|~translationMissing
Any tips for blending in?~|~translationMissing
Well keep your disguise on for a start. You'll want a suitable name as well. Your current one isn't very fitting. If anyone asks, you're called [vampyre name].~|~translationMissing
[vampyre name]. It suits you, [player name].~|~translationMissing
[vampyre name], right. Anything else I should know?~|~translationMissing
I expect you to see many things you consider undesirable while in Darkmeyer, especially where your kind are concerned.~|~translationMissing
While you may be tempted to get involved, don't. Stay in character no matter what.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back once I have the logs. Wish me luck.~|~translationMissing
Good luck [player name]. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Myreque prevail [player name].~|~translationMissing
You should get going friend. Darkmeyer awaits.~|~translationMissing
Good luck. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Be careful in Darkmeyer, friend. I can't even imagine how dangerous that city is.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I shall be.~|~translationMissing
You need to infiltrate Darkmeyer and recover eight logs from the Blisterwood tree. Now, off you go.~|~translationMissing
Mordan Nikazsi~|~translationMissing
I'm not interested in making small talk.~|~translationMissing
Desmodus Lasiurus~|~translationMissing
To go in the Arboretum.~|~translationMissing
Well you can't.~|~translationMissing
Because nobody can go in the Arboretum.~|~translationMissing
That can't be true. Someone must be allowed in?~|~translationMissing
[vampyre name]. I'm new here.~|~translationMissing
Clearly. Well [vampyre name], you're wrong. No one can go in the Arboretum, by order of the Drakan family themselves.~|~translationMissing
Why do you want to go in, anyway?~|~translationMissing
Do you actually care?~|~translationMissing
No, but I have a job to do.~|~translationMissing
What will it take for you to let me in? There must be something you want. Do you want money?~|~translationMissing
I have no need for your money.~|~translationMissing
What then?~|~translationMissing
Eugh, fine! There's something I need doing. Get it done for me and I'll grant you access.~|~translationMissing
Great! What do you need?~|~translationMissing
There's a juvinate who was meant to deliver something to me. He hasn't shown up. Find him and tell him that Desmodus Lasiurus is getting impatient.~|~translationMissing
Sure thing! What's he meant to be delivering?~|~translationMissing
Some slaves. You heard of Gadderanks? He was some human that Vanstrom used to help collect blood tithes.~|~translationMissing
Well, he went and got himself killed by the Myreque. Vanstrom owed me a favour so he agreed to let me have his wife and child.~|~translationMissing
Oh... I see.~|~translationMissing
You got a problem?~|~translationMissing
Good. Mordan Nikazsi is the juvinate you're looking for. He'll be somewhere in the lowest tier of the city. Now, get lost!~|~translationMissing
Trying to enter the Arboretum.~|~translationMissing
Did you find Mordan Nikazsi?~|~translationMissing
Why are you here then? He'll be somewhere in the lowest tier of the city. Go find him!~|~translationMissing
He sold your slaves to Alexei Jovkai.~|~translationMissing
That filthy wretch! I'll have him killed for this! Go find my slaves and bring them to me!~|~translationMissing
Are you Mordan Nikazsi?~|~translationMissing
Yes, what of it?~|~translationMissing
Desmodus Lasiurus sent me.~|~translationMissing
Oh great, just what I need.~|~translationMissing
He wants his slaves. When are you planning to deliver them?~|~translationMissing
I'm not. He shan't be getting his slaves.~|~translationMissing
Err... Why not?~|~translationMissing
Because I sold them to someone else.~|~translationMissing
Why? Because I'm starving that's why! You lords and ladies probably haven't noticed yet, but you will soon enough. It's only a matter of time before you all run out of blood as well!~|~translationMissing
So you sold them for blood? Did you not think Desmodus would notice?~|~translationMissing
If I didn't do something I'd have been dead anyway. Better a quick death at Desmodus' hands than a slow one due to starvation!~|~translationMissing
Look I don't care what happens between you and Desmodus, I just need to recover those slaves. Who did you sell them to?~|~translationMissing
Don't waste your time, you won't get them back.~|~translationMissing
Because I sold them to Lord Alexei Jovkai, one of the most powerful vampyres in the city. He looks at you the same way you look at me. He'll never let you have them.~|~translationMissing
We'll see. Where can I find him?~|~translationMissing
He lives in the upper part of the city, but the slaves won't be there. He has a prison north of the Arboretum. That's where you'll find them.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like I need to visit this prison then.~|~translationMissing
Why are you back again?~|~translationMissing
Remind me, where can I find Desmodus' slaves?~|~translationMissing
They're not his slaves. They belong to Alexei Jovkai now. He'll be keeping them in his prison north of the Arboretum.~|~translationMissing
Go away then.~|~translationMissing
Leave me alone. I have a job to do.~|~translationMissing
The boy doesn't seem to want to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Is your name Gadderanks?~|~translationMissing
Maria Gadderanks~|~translationMissing
Yes... I'm Maria Gadderanks. But... You're not one of Lord Jovkai's lot.~|~translationMissing
No I'm not. Are you doing okay?~|~translationMissing
I... I think so. We only arrived here a short while ago, but they've already given us food and some new clothes for Ron.~|~translationMissing
You must be new around here. Lord Jovkai isn't like the rest of your lot. He keeps us well looked after.~|~translationMissing
He's taking care of you?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. A nice bed, good food and clean clothes. All he asks in return is a bit of blood from time to time. Lovely guy.~|~translationMissing
I don't...~|~translationMissing
Hey you! What are you doing?~|~translationMissing
I was just talking to the... prisoners?~|~translationMissing
Well clear off! These are Lord Jovkai's personal tithes.~|~translationMissing
Lord Alexei Jovkai enters the prison.~|~translationMissing
Lord Alexei Jovkai~|~translationMissing
What's all this noise? What's going on in here?~|~translationMissing
It's this vyre, my lord. They're here to cause trouble.~|~translationMissing
You! Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm [vampyre name]. And I'm not here to cause any trouble, thank you very much.~|~translationMissing
I will be the judge of that, [vampyre name]. Now, why are you here?~|~translationMissing
These prisoners of yours, they were promised to Desmodus Lasiurus.~|~translationMissing
He's a guard at the Arboretum.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so he's a nobody. Well, these prisoners are mine, I paid for them. You'll have to tell him to find some different ones.~|~translationMissing
Yes... It seems nice here. We'd like to stay.~|~translationMissing
Jovkai! What's going on here?~|~translationMissing
Nothing for you to concern yourself with Vanstrom. I have this under control.~|~translationMissing
It doesn't seem that way.~|~translationMissing
Tell me, is it now protocol for the head of the vyrewatch to come and investigate every disturbance?~|~translationMissing
Surely you have bigger problems, like the blood shortages amongst the commoners?~|~translationMissing
As it so happens I was on my way to the lower city to look into that very issue. However, on my way past, I heard shouting.~|~translationMissing
And you decided to investigate? How convenient. Tell me, is Lord Drakan really so interested in my business that he's now having you spy on me?~|~translationMissing
You're paranoid, Jovkai. Lord Drakan doesn't care about you.~|~translationMissing
No. Many are starting to wonder if he cares about any of us.~|~translationMissing
Careful there, Jovkai. Now tell me, what's happening here?~|~translationMissing
This vyre was trying to steal some of my prisoners. I was having them removed.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... I know those humans. That's the Gadderanks family. They don't belong to you.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean? I paid for them!~|~translationMissing
That doesn't make them yours. These prisoners belong to Desmodus Lasiurus. You will have them returned to him at once.~|~translationMissing
Or what? You don't get to order me around!~|~translationMissing
You may be a lord, but you still answer to the Drakan family. That means you also answer to me.~|~translationMissing
And what do you think Lasiurus will do with them if I give them to him? They're safe here. They'll be looked after.~|~translationMissing
I do not care what Lasiurus does with them any more than I care about you and your weird tendencies.~|~translationMissing
Now, we're done here. See that the prisoners are returned, or I'll have this place shut down.~|~translationMissing
You there, vyre!~|~translationMissing
Ye... Yes?~|~translationMissing
You will return to Lasiurus and tell him that his prisoners are on their way.~|~translationMissing
Wait... Your voice, vyre. It sounds... familiar.~|~translationMissing
What is your name?~|~translationMissing
Clearly. Which makes me wonder why I'd know your voice.~|~translationMissing
Turn and face me. I want to get a good look at you.~|~translationMissing
Turn, and face me. I will not ask again.~|~translationMissing
Sarius Guile~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom!~|~translationMissing
Eugh, what now Guile?~|~translationMissing
Forgive me for the interruption, but Lady Vanescula has urgent need of you.~|~translationMissing
Fine. My business here is done, regardless.~|~translationMissing
I thought we might do okay here but I guess we have another new owner now.~|~translationMissing
Why are you still here? Go tell Lasiurus that his slaves will be with him soon.~|~translationMissing
Have you sorted my slaves out?~|~translationMissing
It's all dealt with. They'll be with you soon.~|~translationMissing
Good. Maybe you're not as useless as you look.~|~translationMissing
I can go in the Arboretum now, then?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Just don't tell anyone I let you in.~|~translationMissing
Can I go in the Arboretum?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Now leave me alone.~|~translationMissing
Banker~|~translationMissing
I want to access my bank account.~|~translationMissing
Newcomers aren't allowed to use the bank. Come back once you've earned our trust.~|~translationMissing
I don't have time to poke around down there. I have work to do.~|~translationMissing
Now's not the time for searching through corpses. I have work to do.~|~translationMissing
You're back. Do you have the logs?~|~translationMissing
Well run along then. We need eight logs from the blisterwood tree.~|~translationMissing
Good work [player name]. Did it all go okay?~|~translationMissing
It was a bit close at times. But I managed it.~|~translationMissing
A bit close? You nearly blew everything with your little run in with Vanstrom. It was a good job I had Sarius keep an eye on you.~|~translationMissing
Spying on me?~|~translationMissing
I just wasn't convinced you'd be able to do the job. It seems I was right to be cautious.~|~translationMissing
I had it under control. By the way, where is Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
He said he needed a walk. I told him not to, but he insisted he'd be fine.~|~translationMissing
You worry too much. Safalaan is a big boy.~|~translationMissing
Now, [player name]. Time to get these weapons made.~|~translationMissing
I've given your friend Vertida the required information. He will show you what to do.~|~translationMissing
He's at the Meiyerditch hideout. Make sure to take the logs with you. The others need them for their own weapons.~|~translationMissing
Right then. I'll be back once the weapons are made.~|~translationMissing
Deliver those blisterwood logs to Vertida in the Meiyerditch hideout. He'll show you how to make the new weapons out of them.~|~translationMissing
Right, I'll be back later.~|~translationMissing
You're meant to be working with Vertida to make the blisterwood weaponry. Run along now.~|~translationMissing
I hear you're meant to be bringing us some logs. Do you have them?~|~translationMissing
I'll be here once you have them. We need eight in total.~|~translationMissing
Great. Could I have seven of them?~|~translationMissing
You give seven blisterwood logs to Vertida.~|~translationMissing
Right, we're going to be using these logs to make blisterwood sickles. That's what most of us will be using in the battle.~|~translationMissing
However, I think you'll be able to swap out the sickle on your flail for a blisterwood one.~|~translationMissing
A blisterwood flail. I like the sound of that. So how do we make these sickles?~|~translationMissing
It should be very similar to how you made your emerald sickle. First, you'll want a blessed silver sickle. We have plenty in the crate over there.~|~translationMissing
You'll want to take your blessed sickle and use a chisel to embed a ruby in it. You'll need to get your own ruby I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
Once that's done, you'll need to enchant the ruby sickle using a ruby enchant spell.~|~translationMissing
Finally, you'll need to use a knife to combine your sickle with the blisterwood logs. That will give you a blisterwood sickle.~|~translationMissing
And then I can attach that to my flail?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. If you need any help, just let me know.~|~translationMissing
I'll get started.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep them for now.~|~translationMissing
Well let me know when you're ready to hand them over.~|~translationMissing
First you'll want to take a blessed silver sickle and use a chisel to embed a ruby in it. There's some blessed sickles in a crate here but you'll need to get your own ruby.~|~translationMissing
Finally, you'll need to use a knife to combine your sickle with the blisterwood logs. That will give you a blisterwood sickle that you can attach to your flail.~|~translationMissing
Great. I'll get going.~|~translationMissing
Good, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Well met, [player name]. Do you have your weapon?~|~translationMissing
Well off you go then. You'll need it before we go any further.~|~translationMissing
Well met, [player name]. I'm guessing you have your weapon?~|~translationMissing
That's right. I'm prepared.~|~translationMissing
And you took the logs to the others?~|~translationMissing
I did indeed.~|~translationMissing
Then we are ready.~|~translationMissing
Safalaan isn't back yet.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where he went?~|~translationMissing
There's a path just north of the graveyard. He went for a walk in that direction.~|~translationMissing
I'll see if I can find him.~|~translationMissing
You need to try and find Safalaan. He went for a walk just north of the graveyard.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be back once I've found him.~|~translationMissing
You're meant to be finding Safalaan. Off you go.~|~translationMissing
[player name].~|~translationMissing
Safalaan.~|~translationMissing
So this is it. All these years of fighting. All these years of running. It all ends today. One way or another.~|~translationMissing
One way or another.~|~translationMissing
You seem troubled?~|~translationMissing
I guess that makes two of us.~|~translationMissing
Ha! Well, I asked first.~|~translationMissing
Do you remember Gadderanks?~|~translationMissing
The human that worked with Vanstrom? Didn't you and Veliaf kill him?~|~translationMissing
We did. Before he died though, he helped us. In return, he asked us to help his family.~|~translationMissing
I found them, in Darkmeyer. They were in a prison, albeit a nice one. The vampyre that owned it looked after his tithes.~|~translationMissing
They're not there anymore though, thanks to me. Another vampyre has them now. One that I don't imagine will show any kindness to them.~|~translationMissing
I assume you had no choice?~|~translationMissing
Yes. It was the only way for me to get into the Arboretum. That doesn't change what I did, though. I broke my promise to a dying man.~|~translationMissing
A man that worked for the vampyres.~|~translationMissing
Because he had no other choice. Vanstrom would have killed his family otherwise.~|~translationMissing
We make the hard choices to spare others from having to.~|~translationMissing
Yes. But this time we weren't the ones who paid for it.~|~translationMissing
When Drakan is gone, and Morytania is free, it will all be worth it.~|~translationMissing
If Vanescula keeps her word.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's me. Your turn.~|~translationMissing
It's possible we will encounter Vanstrom today.~|~translationMissing
And I wonder... is there anything left of the man he once was?~|~translationMissing
Does the process of vampyrification destroy everything that makes us human? Or does it just hide it?~|~translationMissing
Maybe we'll never know. And yet...~|~translationMissing
Our whole order was built upon hope. A hope so small, it might as well have not even existed. But that never stopped us.~|~translationMissing
I still cling on to some hope for him. Is that wrong?~|~translationMissing
It's rarely wrong to hope.~|~translationMissing
Well... We could stand here forever, watching the world go by. It's just delaying the inevitable.~|~translationMissing
Time to end it.~|~translationMissing
Oh... One last thing, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Thank you, for everything. It's been a pleasure.~|~translationMissing
Come. Let us return to the others.~|~translationMissing
You and Safalaan return to the graveyard.~|~translationMissing
Well it looks like everything is ready.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Everyone has one of the new blisterwood sickles. They are all prepared.~|~translationMissing
Good. Here's what's going to happen.~|~translationMissing
From here, I will teleport our group to the Darkmeyer Arboretum. There, we will join with some vyres loyal to me.~|~translationMissing
We will take your group to Castle Drakan as our prisoners. Once inside, my vyres will ensure no one enters while we deal with my brother.~|~translationMissing
And then?~|~translationMissing
Once Lowerniel is dead, I will teleport you all back here again. I will then announce his death to my kind and take his place as the ruler of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
From there, we will start to build our new kingdom, together.~|~translationMissing
Yes we will.~|~translationMissing
Make sure you're ready for this, [player name]. Once we start, there's no going back.~|~translationMissing
Good, good. Once you are ready, let me know and we will begin.~|~translationMissing
This is it. This is the day we've spent so long fighting for. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
The player, Vanescula, and the Myreque go to Darkmeyer castle~|~translationMissing
I need more time to prepare.~|~translationMissing
Well don't take too long. Return once you are ready.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to deal with my brother?~|~translationMissing
So this is it. End of the line. Good luck [player name]. I'll see you on the other side.~|~translationMissing
Good luck Ivan. Myreque prevail.~|~translationMissing
Vanescula? What's going on here?~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom. I am here with a gift for my brother.~|~translationMissing
But... that's the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Yes. All the Myreque.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand. How?~|~translationMissing
Your efforts were valiant, Vanstrom. But alas, they were unsuccessful. I decided to take matters into my own hands, using a new tactic.~|~translationMissing
I negotiated with them. Convinced them that I was on their side. After that, bringing them in was trivial.~|~translationMissing
I... I'm sorry my lady, but this just seems too good to be true.~|~translationMissing
Well it is true. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd best be getting inside.~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel Drakan appears in front of the castle doors.~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel Drakan~|~translationMissing
I rememeber when I was young. Our father would take me out into the woods, hunting.~|~translationMissing
That was where I truly discovered what it meant to be alive.~|~translationMissing
The constant fear. That knowledge that if you fail, your very life may well be over.~|~translationMissing
But then at the same time, the thrill. The thrill of the chase. Of the conquest. Nothing can match it.~|~translationMissing
One day, he decided to bring my sister along. He felt it was time for her to develop her own taste for the hunt.~|~translationMissing
She was a natural. A raw talent I had never seen before, and rarely since. I felt a unique pride that day.~|~translationMissing
That wasn't all, of course. There were so many things she excelled at. So many talents.~|~translationMissing
But lying, Vanescula?~|~translationMissing
Lying was never one of them.~|~translationMissing
Brother. I don't...~|~translationMissing
Tell me, Vanescula. What is the cause of this latest betrayal? How is it I have displeased you this time?~|~translationMissing
I don't know what...~|~translationMissing
Vanescula, please. This veil of lies is thinner than the humans you feast upon.~|~translationMissing
Now, the truth.~|~translationMissing
You have been gone too long, brother. While you spend your days hidden away, lamenting about that stupid rock, our kind suffer.~|~translationMissing
Out there, in your city, they're starving. There's not enough blood to go around and their great leader is unwilling to provide a solution.~|~translationMissing
Something has to change, or we're doomed.~|~translationMissing
Vanescula, my dear sister. You disappoint me.~|~translationMissing
You and your kind, you have spent your years engrossing yourself in culture, in aristocracy. Pretending to be something you're not.~|~translationMissing
And in that time, you have forgotten something.~|~translationMissing
Allow me to remind you.~|~translationMissing
I am Lowerniel Vergidiyad Drakan, ruler of Morytania and the lord of Vampyrium.~|~translationMissing
And when you play your games of politics, you do not do so because you're smarter than me.~|~translationMissing
When you weave your words and make your schemes, you are not getting the better of me.~|~translationMissing
No. You do these things only because I allow it. Because your plots are so insignificant to me, that I do not even care to pay attention to them.~|~translationMissing
But now Vanescula, now you have my attention. And now, you will be reminded what it means to cross the lord of Vampyrium.~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel instantly kills all four of Vanescula's vyrewatch sentinels.~|~translationMissing
Vanescula transforms into her vyre form, ready to fight her brother. However, he instantly subdues her.~|~translationMissing
Let's get him!~|~translationMissing
For Andiess!~|~translationMissing
No! Wait!~|~translationMissing
Radigad, Kael, Vertida, and Polmafi are instantly incinerated.~|~translationMissing
Kael! Vertida!~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom.~|~translationMissing
My... my lord?~|~translationMissing
Are you still loyal?~|~translationMissing
Yes, my lord.~|~translationMissing
Good. Deal with the rest of this. My sister and I have much to discuss.~|~translationMissing
Lowerniel teleports away with an unconscious Vanescula.~|~translationMissing
I've waited a long time for this day. The day that the Myreque finally die.~|~translationMissing
There'll be no hellhounds or abominations this time though. This time...~|~translationMissing
...I'll deal with you myself.~|~translationMissing
Wait!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan don't!~|~translationMissing
Well, well. Safalaan Hallow.~|~translationMissing
How long I have wished to end your pitiful life...~|~translationMissing
Stop! Just stop for a moment and think. This isn't who you really are!~|~translationMissing
You had a life before all of this. A life as Ascertes Hallow, my father.~|~translationMissing
Please! Think back to those days. Think back to who you used to be.~|~translationMissing
You talk too much.~|~translationMissing
Shall we begin?~|~translationMissing
Vanstrom attacks the player~|~translationMissing
Blood will be my strength!~|~translationMissing
My pets will feast on your corpse!~|~translationMissing
Stare into darkness!~|~translationMissing
Ha! Did you think you could beat me that easily?~|~translationMissing
See if you can survive this!~|~translationMissing
We need to get back to Darkmeyer.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a blisterwood flail~|~translationMissing
The player and Veliaf return to Darkmeyer castle~|~translationMissing
Well be quick about it.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a blisterwood flail~|~translationMissing
But I've lost my flail.~|~translationMissing
Luckily for you, I had another made. Although I'll have to charge you for it.~|~translationMissing
40,000 coins.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 40,000 coins~|~translationMissing
I don't have that much.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 40,000 coins~|~translationMissing
Veliaf gives you a Blisterwood Flail.~|~translationMissing
Here you go. Now, are you ready?~|~translationMissing
I've managed to retrieve some of your things. I imagine you'll want them back.~|~translationMissing
(Death reclaim interface interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
I don't have anything for you friend. If I did have any of your items, but you died before collecting them, they'll now be lost.~|~translationMissing
Enough! Stop this!~|~translationMissing
Stop? And why would I want to do that?~|~translationMissing
Father, please. You must remember something? Anything!~|~translationMissing
Remember? I remember everything!~|~translationMissing
I remember how weak Ascertes was! The pathetic love he had for his wife, for his children!~|~translationMissing
I remember how good it felt! To be uplifted! To be made something more!~|~translationMissing
And I remember the joy when I took your sister's skull and crushed it with my bare hands!~|~translationMissing
No! No! No!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan's Icyene powers activate, killing Vanstrom and leaving himself unconscious. Meanwhile, two vyrewatch sentinels and a vyrewatch approach the remaining Myreque.~|~translationMissing
Safalaan!~|~translationMissing
Veliaf...~|~translationMissing
[player name]! Safalaan! We need to go!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan?~|~translationMissing
What... What have I done?~|~translationMissing
Ivan, teleport him out of there!~|~translationMissing
I can't! He's too far away!~|~translationMissing
Safalaan please.~|~translationMissing
What have I done?~|~translationMissing
A vyrewatch lands and approaches the player and Safalaan.~|~translationMissing
Damn you Safalaan! Damn you!~|~translationMissing
[player name], get over here! We need to go. Now!~|~translationMissing
Ivan teleports himself, Veliaf, and the player out of Castle Drakan, leaving Safalaan behind.~|~translationMissing
He... He killed them. All of them.~|~translationMissing
Veliaf, what do we do?~|~translationMissing
Veliaf?~|~translationMissing
What do we do? There's nothing we can do. Don't you see, Ivan? It's over. They've won.~|~translationMissing
But we can't give up. We're the Myreque!~|~translationMissing
The Myreque are dead.~|~translationMissing
He's gone. They've all gone.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, [player name]. I need some time alone.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? I could take you back to Paterdomus.~|~translationMissing
No. I'm staying here.~|~translationMissing
Take this. It's not much, but it's all I can offer.~|~translationMissing
Now, please. I'd like to be alone.~|~translationMissing
[player name]. I have a tome here that I think belongs to you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Ivan.~|~translationMissing

I don't think I want to disturb a cave of giants right now...~|~translationMissing
Hill Giant~|~translationMissing
Wait...~|~translationMissing
Do not attack!~|~translationMissing
What the... You can talk?!~|~translationMissing
Do...~|~translationMissing
do not...~|~translationMissing
flig... fight.~|~translationMissing
You don't want to fight me?~|~translationMissing
Want...~|~translationMissing
no, need...~|~translationMissing
your help.~|~translationMissing
I must be dreaming. Giants can't talk!~|~translationMissing
Please...~|~translationMissing
Start the Sleeping Giants quest?~|~translationMissing
Okay giant, I'll help you out, but first you need to tell me your name... if you even have one.~|~translationMissing
Kovac~|~translationMissing
Kovac.~|~translationMissing
Kovac... alright then. My name is [player name]. So, Kovac, what do you need help with?~|~translationMissing
follow in.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... is this a trick? Are you going to cook and eat me?!~|~translationMissing
follow.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays, showing a workshop too big for regular-sized people to use.~|~translationMissing
Woah... What is this place?~|~translationMissing
Kovac...~|~translationMissing
accep... ancestor build.~|~translationMissing
Giants built this place?~|~translationMissing
long ago.~|~translationMissing
How? Giants don't build, do they? I thought they were brutes...~|~translationMissing
Before...~|~translationMissing
giants differing.~|~translationMissing
Now...~|~translationMissing
not.~|~translationMissing
Huh? I don't understand what you mean.~|~translationMissing
Look.~|~translationMissing
Kovac looks out to the tools around you.~|~translationMissing
Help fix.~|~translationMissing
You want me to help you by fixing those tools?~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll help, but first you need to tell me what this place was used for?~|~translationMissing
Make...~|~translationMissing
wheelpo... weapons.~|~translationMissing
Giants made weapons here?~|~translationMissing
That's incredible! But why do you want to make weapons? Most giants I've come across already have weapons?~|~translationMissing
giants...~|~translationMissing
remember.~|~translationMissing
Remember what?~|~translationMissing
Giants...~|~translationMissing
not just...~|~translationMissing
killers.~|~translationMissing
Kovac want...~|~translationMissing
help giants remember.~|~translationMissing
I see. To be honest, if I hadn't seen this place myself, I wouldn't have believed you.~|~translationMissing
Alright, Kovac, I'll help you out. What do we need to do first?~|~translationMissing
We fix tools...~|~translationMissing
No way! I'm getting out of here. There's no chance I'd trust a giant!~|~translationMissing
help.~|~translationMissing
What's left to fix, Kovac?~|~translationMissing
Trip hammer...~|~translationMissing
Grindstone...~|~translationMissing
Polishing wheel...~|~translationMissing
Kovac, where did you get this chest from?~|~translationMissing
chest store stuff.~|~translationMissing
Kovac shrugs...~|~translationMissing
Alright then...~|~translationMissing
What do you keep in this box?~|~translationMissing
stuff.~|~translationMissing
Very insightful...~|~translationMissing
What is this, Kovac?~|~translationMissing
look like big bucket.~|~translationMissing
I can see that, but what's it used for?~|~translationMissing
maybe we put things in.~|~translationMissing
Kovac need think about it more.~|~translationMissing
Having all this lava here without a barrier is quite dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Kovac agree.~|~translationMissing
Should we try building something to keep us safe?~|~translationMissing
no.~|~translationMissing
Just no swim in the hot juice.~|~translationMissing
What is this table used for, Kovac?~|~translationMissing
look like we put thing on it.~|~translationMissing
Kovac not sure what yet.~|~translationMissing
Kovac think about it more.~|~translationMissing
This looks a little dangerous. Quite a perilous place to store something.~|~translationMissing
good place to cook food.~|~translationMissing
Hot meat very good.~|~translationMissing
Not everyday you see a waterfall in a cave.~|~translationMissing
Kovac drink from waterfall...~|~translationMissing
Hydration impote... importent.~|~translationMissing
I agree, it's very important.~|~translationMissing
I think this has seen better days. What was it?~|~translationMissing
big hammer.~|~translationMissing
Right... and what did it do?~|~translationMissing
Hit things.~|~translationMissing
Very perceptive, Kovac.~|~translationMissing
Let me take a look and see if I can fix it.~|~translationMissing
Repair the trip hammer?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the materials required~|~translationMissing
You will need an oak log, 5 nails and a hammer to repair the trip hammer.~|~translationMissing
That looks like it'll do the trick. What do you think?~|~translationMissing
that look right.~|~translationMissing
What's it supposed to do?~|~translationMissing
Kovac takes a long look at the trip hammer...~|~translationMissing
Kovac think Kovac figure it out.~|~translationMissing
Go on.~|~translationMissing
Trip hammer power by water...~|~translationMissing
Water spin wheel and raise hammer.~|~translationMissing
Hammer fall and crump sword into shape.~|~translationMissing
That makes sense. Quite resourceful for giants to make something water powered.~|~translationMissing
Mhm...~|~translationMissing
What was this meant to be?~|~translationMissing
Kovac think it was for grinnin... grinding.~|~translationMissing
I see. It looks like it's lost its teeth.~|~translationMissing
Kovac conquer.~|~translationMissing
Conquer? It's already broken! Hitting it more won't help.~|~translationMissing
Right... now we're agreed, I'll see what I can do to fix it.~|~translationMissing
Repair the grindstone?~|~translationMissing
The player begins to fix the grindstone.~|~translationMissing
Well that required a bit of elbow grease. It should be good to go now.~|~translationMissing
Thank you small one...~|~translationMissing
Didn't want to try and help me?~|~translationMissing
Kovac did not know how...~|~translationMissing
Kovac beggin... beginning to understand.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me what this is used for then?~|~translationMissing
Kovac takes a long look at the grindstone...~|~translationMissing
Grindstone important...~|~translationMissing
We grind sword against stone...~|~translationMissing
make sword sharp.~|~translationMissing
So we use it when making swords?~|~translationMissing
Okay, what is this thing? It just looks like a wheel to me.~|~translationMissing
Kovac ponders your question...~|~translationMissing
Kovac think he know.~|~translationMissing
This polishing wheel...~|~translationMissing
make thing shiny.~|~translationMissing
Looks like it's lost its soft edge then.~|~translationMissing
Repair the polishing wheel?~|~translationMissing
You will need some wool, 2 oak logs, 5 nails and a hammer to repair the polishing wheel.~|~translationMissing
Not my finest work, but I think it will do.~|~translationMissing
So when would we use the polishing wheel?~|~translationMissing
Polishing sword impotan... important.~|~translationMissing
Create perfect killing edge...~|~translationMissing
very good for sword.~|~translationMissing
That makes sense.~|~translationMissing
That's all the tools repaired. Well... as best as I can do.~|~translationMissing
Kovac begin to understand more now.~|~translationMissing
I've noticed your speech has been improving over time as well.~|~translationMissing
Kovac know what say...~|~translationMissing
but sometime hard say proppel... properly.~|~translationMissing
That's alright, we'll figure it out together.~|~translationMissing
Kovac agree. Ready to make sword?~|~translationMissing
Yes! I'm itching to get started.~|~translationMissing
Kovac get few things ready first...~|~translationMissing
then we can start.~|~translationMissing
Okay Kovac, I think I'm ready to make a sword.~|~translationMissing
Kovac feel like things look correct...~|~translationMissing
Kovac think you are right.~|~translationMissing
So what do I need to do to make a sword?~|~translationMissing
First...~|~translationMissing
you will need a coliti... commission.~|~translationMissing
Kovac will supply them...~|~translationMissing
Kovac already gotten one from old friend.~|~translationMissing
Okay, so what do I need to make?~|~translationMissing
Kovac need a Flat Broad sword.~|~translationMissing
How do I make that?~|~translationMissing
Kovac think we need to fill the...~|~translationMissing
how's it called...~|~translationMissing
the big stone bucket...~|~translationMissing
Oh, you mean a crucible?~|~translationMissing
Yes, thank you...~|~translationMissing
Kovac think we need to fill the crucible with metal first.~|~translationMissing
Kovac has been connecti... collecting metals...~|~translationMissing
They're in that box-crate by entry.~|~translationMissing
Use bars and weapons...~|~translationMissing
Crucible can take both.~|~translationMissing
Load metals into crucible until it looks full.~|~translationMissing
While you do that...~|~translationMissing
Kovac think about next thing we need to do.~|~translationMissing
You rummage through the box...~|~translationMissing
You find a bunch of metal bars and old weapons!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 20 open inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
You will need 20 free inventory slots to take the items from the crate.~|~translationMissing
Take the items?~|~translationMissing
You take a selection of bars and weapons from the crate.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I've got the metal you said to take from the box. What now?~|~translationMissing
You will need to fill the crucible...~|~translationMissing
Add metals, armour or weapon you find to fill it.~|~translationMissing
We stick to bronze and iron for this sword...~|~translationMissing
We keep the first sword simple.~|~translationMissing
I've added a few things to the crucible. Is that enough?~|~translationMissing
No, we need more...~|~translationMissing
28 metal bars worth. Weapon and armour can go into crucible too but some metal lost when melted down.~|~translationMissing
Right, that's the crucible full. Can I make the sword yet?~|~translationMissing
Kovac think we need to set up a mould.~|~translationMissing
What's a mould used for?~|~translationMissing
Kovac think mould will determine the type of sword to be made.~|~translationMissing
Remember, we need a Flat Broad sword.~|~translationMissing
Okay, so how do I go about setting up a mould?~|~translationMissing
Kovac remember being told a sword is made from three parts...~|~translationMissing
a forte, a blade and a tip.~|~translationMissing
Use mould jig behind you...~|~translationMissing
You can select part for each selecti... section.~|~translationMissing
Each mould part is differing...~|~translationMissing
They will suit different commissions better...~|~translationMissing
Look for parts that match commission.~|~translationMissing
Right... I think I'm with you.~|~translationMissing
If you are still confused...~|~translationMissing
come back to me.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry Kovac, but I'm not entirely sure what I'm meant to be doing.~|~translationMissing
That is okay...~|~translationMissing
Kovac not so sure of himself...~|~translationMissing
but you help Kovac, so Kovac help you.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Kovac. You're gentle for a giant.~|~translationMissing
So what was it I needed to do at the mould jig?~|~translationMissing
We need to fill each part of the mould...~|~translationMissing
Forte, blade and tip.~|~translationMissing
We want to use mould parts that match collisi... commission Kovac give you.~|~translationMissing
Remember, each part suit a differing sword better...~|~translationMissing
Look for ones that match Flat and Broad.~|~translationMissing
Right, the mould is setup and the crucible is full to the brim. We must be ready to pour.~|~translationMissing
let me look.~|~translationMissing
Kovac takes a look at what you've done...~|~translationMissing
Yes, all things look correct...~|~translationMissing
Well done little one. We are ready.~|~translationMissing
Pour the metal from the crucible into the mould...~|~translationMissing
then take out the preform.~|~translationMissing
Once you have done that...~|~translationMissing
Kovac will tell how to work the preform.~|~translationMissing
The metal's too hot to pick up!~|~translationMissing
What do I do?~|~translationMissing
Cool it down...~|~translationMissing
What do you expect?~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course... How do I do that?~|~translationMissing
Kovac do not know. Try pouring water on it.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure what to do next...~|~translationMissing
take the preform and put it in your hand. Then come see Kovac for help.~|~translationMissing
The preform is still molten! You need to cool it down.~|~translationMissing
You must free your hands so you can hold the preform.~|~translationMissing
Okay Kovac, I've got this huge burning hot sword. What do I do with it?~|~translationMissing
Now for fun part.~|~translationMissing
Use tools around the foundry to reclin... refine the preform.~|~translationMissing
How do I know which tool I need to use?~|~translationMissing
Kovac not too sure. Kovac's gut feeling says use trip hammer first.~|~translationMissing
Progress on your sword can be tracked via the display on screen. You can track which tool you need to use via the completion bar.~|~translationMissing
This is very impoten... important...~|~translationMissing
The preform needs to be within a certain heat range to work properly.~|~translationMissing
If you use the wrong tool...~|~translationMissing
or tool at wrong heat, we damage the preform quality.~|~translationMissing
A sword with low quality is bad...~|~translationMissing
Means less giants will want it, so Kovac give less for it.~|~translationMissing
If you damage a preform too much, it will become junk and Kovac will have to throw it away...~|~translationMissing
but this first attent... attempt, so do not worry about quality too much.~|~translationMissing
You use trip hammer first. Trip hammer need preform to be quite hot.~|~translationMissing
The temperature of the preform is tracked via the temperature bar.~|~translationMissing
To work a preform with a tool, the temperature needs to be within the matched temperature range, or you'll damage the preform.~|~translationMissing
Any damage to the preform will lower its quality, tracked via the quality bar. If there's no quality left in the preform it becomes unworkable, and must be throw away.~|~translationMissing
If the preform at wrong temperature...~|~translationMissing
You can hot it up by dunking it in lava or cold it by holding it to waterfall.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll give it a go.~|~translationMissing
Remember, try trip hammer first with hot preform.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure which tool I need to use next.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... you need to use the trip hammer.~|~translationMissing
Make sure preform is nice and hot...~|~translationMissing
Trip hammer needs a high temperature.~|~translationMissing
What did I do wrong?~|~translationMissing
You're damaging the preform!~|~translationMissing
The sword is too cold. We need to heat it up to use it on the trip hammer.~|~translationMissing
Oh, my bad!~|~translationMissing
Using wrong tool. We should be using the grindstone.~|~translationMissing
Using wrong tool. We should be using the trip hammer.~|~translationMissing
time to move over to the grindstone.~|~translationMissing
The preform need to be warm...~|~translationMissing
Fictio... friction from grindstone will heat the preform up as well.~|~translationMissing
The sword is too hot. We need to cool it down to use it on the grindstone.~|~translationMissing
The sword is too cold. We need to heat it up to use it on the grindstone.~|~translationMissing
Using wrong tool. We should be using the polishing wheel.~|~translationMissing
You are almost done...~|~translationMissing
You just need to use polishing wheel to finish preform off.~|~translationMissing
Preform need to be quite cool to work with polishing wheel.~|~translationMissing
The sword is too hot. We need to cool it down to use it on the polishing wheel.~|~translationMissing
The sword is too cold. We need to heat it up to use it on the polishing wheel.~|~translationMissing
Looks like the sword is finished. I should take it to Kovac.~|~translationMissing
I should finish helping Kovac before I try making another sword.~|~translationMissing
Okay Kovac, I think I've finally finished the sword!~|~translationMissing
Hmm... let Kovac look.~|~translationMissing
You pass the sword over to Kovac...~|~translationMissing
He analyses your work...~|~translationMissing

We still leanin... learning.~|~translationMissing
So what do we do with it now?~|~translationMissing
Kovac take care of it.~|~translationMissing
Out of curiosity, who is this first blade for?~|~translationMissing
If the player has 0 Obor kill count~|~translationMissing
Kovac friend...~|~translationMissing
Obor.~|~translationMissing
Obor? Can't say I've heard of them.~|~translationMissing
Kovac think Obor show other giants how strong our swords are. Then every giant want one.~|~translationMissing
That's a pretty clever marketing plan, I must admit.~|~translationMissing
Kovac know what he do sometime...~|~translationMissing
Kovac know what he do sometime... Thank you for help, [player name]. You free to use foundry whenever you want.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 1 Obor kill count~|~translationMissing
Obor? He's just going to use it to kill me!~|~translationMissing
Obor good friend. Kovac know he only attack if you trespass his cave...~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should have some manners and knock first.~|~translationMissing
Well, you're not wrong there... I normally just let myself in.~|~translationMissing
Yes, manner very important.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for help, [player name]. You free to use foundry whenever you want.~|~translationMissing

Not good at all my friend. It's Elena, she's been taken...~|~translationMissing
Taken? By who?~|~translationMissing
The Knights of Ardougne. They claimed she was inciting rebellion against the king. Apparently she's been going around telling people that the plague isn't real...~|~translationMissing
Oh dear... This is a problem.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything you can do to help us? It feels wrong to ask given what you've done for us before, but we're desperate.~|~translationMissing
Start the Song of the Elves quest?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure this is all just a misunderstanding. Let me try talking to the king.~|~translationMissing
Thank you friend.~|~translationMissing
I can't help I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
Edmond tells me you're helping Elena again. Thank you so much.~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name]. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I'm here to talk about Elena, apparently she's been imprisoned.~|~translationMissing
That she has. She was making some heinous accusations.~|~translationMissing
That the plague is fake?~|~translationMissing
Right... But you and I both know that she's right, the plague is fake.~|~translationMissing
That's not the point. As I've explained to you before, the plague is a necessary evil. We can't have her exposing the truth and risking everything.~|~translationMissing
But King Tyras is dead, what exactly are we risking?~|~translationMissing
My brother may be dead but the Dark Lord is still a threat. Until that threat is gone, the plague must remain.~|~translationMissing
So you won't free Elena?~|~translationMissing
No. I can't take any risks. Now I'm afraid I have business to attend to. You should be on your way.~|~translationMissing
I see. I guess I should let her father know.~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name]. What can I do for you.~|~translationMissing
About Elena...~|~translationMissing
We've been through this already. I will not have the girl freed. She is a threat to Ardougne and will remain imprisoned.~|~translationMissing
Knight of Ardougne~|~translationMissing
Sorry citizen. Only Knights of Ardougne are allowed in the prison.~|~translationMissing
Hello there citizen. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
What's down these stairs?~|~translationMissing
These stairs lead to the Ardougne Prison. It's home to thieves, murderers and everything in between.~|~translationMissing
Sounds lovely. Can I go in?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not citizen. Only the Knights of Ardougne are allowed into the prison and I can see that you are no knight.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Have you spoken to the king yet?~|~translationMissing
He won't be freeing her I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
But why? I know all this plague business has got her a bit emotional, but can't he see that she's just upset?~|~translationMissing
He said she was a threat to Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
A threat? But she's no danger to anyone. Why does he think that way?~|~translationMissing
Well the thing is...~|~translationMissing
Well... She's right. The plague is a lie. That's why the king had her imprisoned. He was afraid she'd expose the truth.~|~translationMissing
The plague is a lie? What do you mean the plague is a lie?~|~translationMissing
I guess I have some explaining to do.~|~translationMissing
You most certainly do.~|~translationMissing
Well, it all started after I freed Elena from West Ardougne. As you can imagine, she was still keen on helping the plague victims and asked me to help her find a cure.~|~translationMissing
We sent some samples to her old teacher, Guidor in Varrock. He ran some tests and found out that the plague isn't actually real. I confronted the king on this and he admitted it.~|~translationMissing
The king told me that his brother, King Tyras, was corrupted by the Dark Lord while exploring the lands to the west.~|~translationMissing
As Tyras was the king of West Ardougne, King Lathas decided to cordon the city off to keep the rest of the world safe.~|~translationMissing
The plague was the excuse he gave for the quarantine.~|~translationMissing
But that doesn't make any sense. Why not just tell the truth? Why lie to everyone and make up a plague? Something doesn't seem right about it all.~|~translationMissing
Well you're right about that. Turns out King Lathas was lying about that as well. But I'll get to that in a minute.~|~translationMissing
After confronting the king, he recruited me and tasked me with helping him stop Tyras. He had me travel through the Underground Pass into the elven forests of Tirannwn.~|~translationMissing
Elves? I wasn't even sure they existed anymore.~|~translationMissing
Well Tirannwn is full of them. In fact, they're currently in the middle of a civil war.~|~translationMissing
An elven civil war? I'm going to need a drink after all of this. So what happened next?~|~translationMissing
I met with an ally of King Lathas, an elf called Lord Iorwerth. He's the leader of one of the elven factions. With his help, I was successful in assassinating King Tyras.~|~translationMissing
With the job done, I returned to Ardougne. However, on my way back, I was intercepted by an elf named Arianwyn, the leader of the rebel elves opposing Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
He revealed the truth to me, that King Lathas and Lord Iorwerth are in fact the evil ones. Together they intend to summon this Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
Just when I thought this story couldn't get any worse. The king is evil? Why?~|~translationMissing
From what I can tell, King Lathas hated how his father split the kingdom, giving half to him and half to his brother. He wanted his brother dead from the start.~|~translationMissing
Not only that, he also wants to reclaim Camelot from King Arthur. I think he's hoping that this Dark Lord will help him.~|~translationMissing
All of this, just because Lathas wants more land? What about this Lord Iorwerth, what's in it for him?~|~translationMissing
I think he wants to use the Dark Lord to defeat the rebel elves and end the civil war. Apparently, it's been going on for hundreds of years.~|~translationMissing
I see, this still doesn't explain why the plague was made up though.~|~translationMissing
Well since I learnt the truth, I've been helping the rebel elves fight back against King Lathas and Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
I recently discovered that Lord Iorwerth believes the secrets to summoning the Dark Lord lie within the Temple of Light beneath Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
The plague was made up to hide their mining operation beneath the city.~|~translationMissing
All the mourners are actually Iorwerth elves in disguise and the people who they claim have died of the plague are actually getting sent into the mines.~|~translationMissing
Goodness me Elena, what have you gotten yourself into?~|~translationMissing
Thank you for telling me the truth [player name]. I just wish you had told me sooner.~|~translationMissing
If even half of what you say about King Lathas is true, then my daughter is in great danger. We need to help her.~|~translationMissing
Do you have something in mind?~|~translationMissing
I do. They're holding Elena in the city prison beneath the castle. You'll need to disguise yourself as a Knight of Ardougne, infiltrate the prison and find a way to free her.~|~translationMissing
As much as I hate to admit it, I'm far too old to pass as a knight. It will have to be you.~|~translationMissing
How do I get this disguise?~|~translationMissing
You'll need to get a steel platebody, some steel platelegs and a steel full helm. The plume on the helm will need dying red and you'll need a tabard for the platebody.~|~translationMissing
My wife should be able to help you with the tabard. You'll have to check with her to see what she needs for it. Come back to me once you have everything and we'll discuss what to do next.~|~translationMissing
You need to disguise yourself as a Knight of Ardougne. Get yourself a steel platebody, some steel platelegs and a steel full helm. The plume on the helm will need dying red and you'll need a tabard for the platebody.~|~translationMissing
It's not a problem. Do you think you could give me a hand with something?~|~translationMissing
I need to make a Knight of Ardougne tabard.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well that shouldn't be too hard for me to do. Could you bring me some silk and some purple dye please?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the required items~|~translationMissing
Luckily for us, I have them both right here.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that is lucky.~|~translationMissing
Give Alrena the items?~|~translationMissing
You give Alrena the silk and purple dye.~|~translationMissing
Here you go, one tabard.~|~translationMissing
Alrena gives you a Knight of Ardougne tabard.~|~translationMissing
You can't have them.~|~translationMissing
Well I can't make your tabard then.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the required items~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Do you have the silk and purple dye yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'll go and get them.~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much for helping Elena. It means so much to Edmond and I.~|~translationMissing
You add the tabard to your platebody, making a Knight of Ardougne platebody.~|~translationMissing
You dye the plume of your helm red, making a Knight of Ardougne helm.~|~translationMissing
I've finished the disguise.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing the disguise~|~translationMissing
Well you definitely look the part. Those guards will be totally fooled. Now get yourself down to the prison and see if you can find a way to free Elena. You'll find it beneath the castle.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, let's have a look at it.~|~translationMissing
Edmond inspects your disguise.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Defence level of 5 or above~|~translationMissing
Yes, this should be perfect. Those guards will be totally fooled. Now get yourself down to the prison and see if you can find a way to free Elena. You'll find it beneath the castle.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Defence level of less than 5~|~translationMissing
Yes, this should be perfect. Those platelegs are a bit dirty though, let me give them a polish for you.~|~translationMissing
There you go. Now get yourself down to the prison and see if you can find a way to free Elena. You'll find it beneath the castle.~|~translationMissing
Take your disguise and head down to the prison to see what you can find out. You'll find it beneath the castle.~|~translationMissing
Hello there fellow knight. Isn't today a wonderful day to be a Knight of Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
I mean it's okay I suppose. The constant fear of some random adventurer murdering you and the fact that people are constantly picking your pockets isn't great. But hey ho, at least the benefits are good.~|~translationMissing
That they are fellow knight, that they are.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, can I go down these stairs?~|~translationMissing
Of course you can! You're a Knight of Ardougne! There is no place where you can't go.~|~translationMissing
Yeah... Thanks.~|~translationMissing
I... Err... [Tim/Sue]?~|~translationMissing
[Tim/Sue]?~|~translationMissing
Yes... [Tim/Sue]...~|~translationMissing
Huh...~|~translationMissing
You don't look much like a [Tim/Sue].~|~translationMissing
What are you doing here... [Tim/Sue]?~|~translationMissing
Just here on guard duty.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Very well. As you were... [Tim/Sue]...~|~translationMissing
Good to see you [Tim/Sue].~|~translationMissing
Who's [Tim/Sue]?~|~translationMissing
You are?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I am [Tim/Sue].~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Is your head working okay today [Tim/Sue]?~|~translationMissing
Of course, my head has never been better.~|~translationMissing
If you say so...~|~translationMissing
Elena it's me, [player name].~|~translationMissing
[player name]? What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Rescuing you of course. Your father told me you were here.~|~translationMissing
Oh thank goodness. It's awful in here. The smell from that mugger...~|~translationMissing
So what happened Elena? How did you end up here?~|~translationMissing
Oh it's quite the tale, but let's save it for until I'm out of here. What's your plan?~|~translationMissing
Well I err... I don't really have one.~|~translationMissing
You don't have a plan? But aren't you meant to be an adventurer? How do you normally do this sort of thing?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, I usually just make it up as I go along.~|~translationMissing
Well luckily for us I have something in mind myself. There's an iron grate at the back of this cell that looks like it leads into the sewers. If I had some sulphuric acid, I could melt through it and escape.~|~translationMissing
But where do we get the sulphuric acid?~|~translationMissing
Thankfully it's pretty much essential in my line of work. I have some at my home, opposite my parents' house. You'll need to get it from my cabinet and bring it here. It's the thick clear liquid.~|~translationMissing
It's okay Elena, it's me again.~|~translationMissing
Ah [player name], thank goodness. How's it going?~|~translationMissing
Go to the cabinet in my home, opposite my parents' house. Find some sulphuric acid and bring it back here. It's the thick clear liquid.~|~translationMissing
Now what did Elena say it looked like?~|~translationMissing
The thin blue liquid.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a chemical in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You take the chemical from the cabinet.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a chemical in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You take the chemical from the cabinet and return your other chemical.~|~translationMissing
The light green powder.~|~translationMissing
The thick clear liquid.~|~translationMissing
The dark red powder.~|~translationMissing
You show Elena the chemical you found.~|~translationMissing
Is this what you needed?~|~translationMissing
If the player obtained the wrong chemical~|~translationMissing
No that's not right at all. You need some sulphuric acid. It's the thick clear liquid.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'll try again.~|~translationMissing
If the player obtained the correct chemical~|~translationMissing
Yes that's it! Hand it over please.~|~translationMissing
You give Elena the chemical.~|~translationMissing
Right, probably best you're not here when I escape. You should head back to my father.~|~translationMissing
Will do. Good luck Elena. I'll see you soon.~|~translationMissing
Now's not the time for games [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Good news Edmond, Elena is free.~|~translationMissing
I know, she already came by to let us know. Thank you so much for your help.~|~translationMissing
Where is she now?~|~translationMissing
She's had to go into hiding to avoid recapture. She asked me to pass on the location though. It's the Rehnison household in West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Edmond. I'll go and see how she's doing.~|~translationMissing
Hi Edmond. Do you know where Elena is?~|~translationMissing
She's had to go into hiding to avoid recapture. She's hiding out at the Rehnison household in West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing a mourner's outfit~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing a mourner's outfit~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name]. I'm afraid I can't talk right now. There's an issue with an escaped prisoner that I need to deal with.~|~translationMissing
Elena's come to visit! Elena's come to visit!~|~translationMissing
I heard. Do you know where she is?~|~translationMissing
She said she had some top secret work to do. Mummy and daddy will know.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'm looking for Elena.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes she said you'd be coming. They're all downstairs. The trapdoor is hidden under the bed.~|~translationMissing
They?~|~translationMissing
You mean you don't know? The resistance of course! You'd better head down, Elena will fill you in.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Could you remind me where Elena is?~|~translationMissing
She's downstairs. The trapdoor is hidden under the bed.~|~translationMissing
There's a trapdoor hidden under the bed.~|~translationMissing
Climb through it.~|~translationMissing
Leave it alone.~|~translationMissing
[player name]!~|~translationMissing
Elena! It's good to see you safe.~|~translationMissing
And you [player name]. Thank you so much for helping to get me out of there.~|~translationMissing
Well I couldn't just leave you to rot. I care about you, Elena.~|~translationMissing
I care about you as well, [player name]. Thank you for not forgetting about me.~|~translationMissing
It's all in a day's work.~|~translationMissing
So what's going on Elena? Why are all these people here?~|~translationMissing
This, [player name], is the Ardougne Resistance!~|~translationMissing
The Ardougne Resistance?~|~translationMissing
Yes! It all started when you told me the truth about the king. I realised that it would take more than just us two to overthrow him, so I started to find allies for us.~|~translationMissing
I see, when were you planning on telling me?~|~translationMissing
Well I knew you were busy infiltrating the mourners so I didn't want to trouble you until we were all set up. We're just about there now though.~|~translationMissing
So is this how you ended up in that prison?~|~translationMissing
It is. It happened while I was trying to gather more support for us. I was trying to convince some people of the truth behind the plague, but they didn't believe me. They reported me and I was arrested not long after.~|~translationMissing
Well you've clearly been quite busy. I've also made some progress since we last spoke.~|~translationMissing
With the mourners? What did you find out?~|~translationMissing
The mourners have been searching for a temple under West Ardougne. There's an altar there that they want to use to summon the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound good at all.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I restored the safeguards on the temple so they shouldn't be able to get in.~|~translationMissing
Ah, that's good to hear. Do you think we're safe now?~|~translationMissing
For now, but we can't rule out King Lathas and Lord Iorwerth finding another way.~|~translationMissing
Well we can't do anything about Lord Iorwerth, your elf friends will have to sort him out. But if we get our way, Lathas might not be king for much longer.~|~translationMissing
So what's your plan?~|~translationMissing
You've met Councillor Halgrive before, right? He's been helping us put a plan together.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you [player name]. Allow me to run you through what we have so far.~|~translationMissing
So unluckily for us, the king has total control over the Paladins and the Knights of Ardougne. With them, he has a large army at his disposal, one we cannot hope to stand against.~|~translationMissing
But you're a councillor, can't you do anything about that?~|~translationMissing
The council serves the king I'm afraid, we can't overrule his decisions. Nor can we take power from him. What we can do however, is step in if the king becomes unfit for rule.~|~translationMissing
But the king is a traitor, surely that's enough reason.~|~translationMissing
It is, but right now it's our word against his. And as you've already seen with Elena, he is keen to keep us silent.~|~translationMissing
Before I was arrested, we'd hoped to gather enough support among the people to be able to peacefully remove the king from power. Sadly, we've not been able to convince many of them.~|~translationMissing
It's no surprise, really. The king has created a clever lie with the plague, one that's easy for people to believe.~|~translationMissing
Councillor Halgrive has come up with an alternative way to gather support. I can't pretend I totally approve of it, but it seems to be our only option.~|~translationMissing
We need people to see the king for what he really is. They're clearly not going to believe us when it comes to the plague, so we'll have to resort to some dirtier tactics.~|~translationMissing
When Elena told me about how you freed her from the prison, it gave me an idea...~|~translationMissing
With your disguise, you can appear to be working directly for the king. Any actions you perform in that disguise will seem like they were ordered by him.~|~translationMissing
I see where this is going. If I upset people while dressed as a Knight of Ardougne, they'll blame the king.~|~translationMissing
And once they are upset, they'll be far more likely to believe what we have to say.~|~translationMissing
You can probably see why I'm not a fan now. If we're to remove the king, it should mark a new start for Ardougne. But if that's all built on a lie, are we any better than the king himself?~|~translationMissing
I agree, this is a dangerous path to follow.~|~translationMissing
It is, and yet it seems to be the only path open to us. I fear the danger of inaction could harm the people far more than a few small lies.~|~translationMissing
It's not good, but it might be our only option.~|~translationMissing
I agree. I fear the danger of inaction could harm the people far more than a few small lies.~|~translationMissing
Who cares, it's for the good of the people.~|~translationMissing
But who are we to decide that?~|~translationMissing
There is no perfect answer here. However, I fear the danger of inaction could harm the people far more than a few small lies.~|~translationMissing
You're right, it just makes me feel uncomfortable, all of this.~|~translationMissing
So, [player name], are you willing to help us?~|~translationMissing
I am.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, let's get to work then. Wear your Knight of Ardougne disguise and use it to turn people against the king in East Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
You'll want to build support in West Ardougne as well but the knights aren't allowed here. You can use your mourner disguise instead though.~|~translationMissing
As you turn people against the king, we'll be on hand to convince them of our cause. If we aim to recruit 80 people from across both parts of Ardougne, we should have quite the army.~|~translationMissing
What sort of things should I do?~|~translationMissing
Anything that upsets people really. I suspect some of the others here will have a few suggestions for you. Just keep an eye out for suitable opportunities.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep track of how many people we've recruited, just let me know if you need an update.~|~translationMissing
Right, I'd better get started then.~|~translationMissing
I need to think about this.~|~translationMissing
Of course, it is a big ask. We'll be here once you have decided.~|~translationMissing
Carla/Jethick/Kilron/Omart~|~translationMissing
You'd better speak to Elena, she'll fill you in on what's happening here.~|~translationMissing
We need to recruit people into our resistance so that we can overthrow the king. Elena can tell you how many people we've recruited.~|~translationMissing
Your role in this is to increase hatred for the king amongst the people. That will allow us to recruit them to our cause.~|~translationMissing
Disguise yourself appropriately and perform any actions that cause upset with the citizens. With your disguise, people will think you are acting on the orders of the king.~|~translationMissing
For East Ardougne, you'll need a Knight of Ardougne disguise. For West Ardougne, you'll want a mourner disguise.~|~translationMissing
If you need any suggestions on what to do, ask the others here and see if they have anything for you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Hey. We haven't recruited anyone into the resistance yet. You should speak to the others if you need help getting started.~|~translationMissing
Hey. We've recruited [number] people into the resistance so far. We still need [number] more.~|~translationMissing
Hey there. Do you have any suggestions for this uprising of ours?~|~translationMissing
Carla~|~translationMissing
I bet people would get pretty angry if they had their food taken away. You could burn the food stores in West Ardougne and claim it's to protect people from the plague.~|~translationMissing
Won't people be willing to accept that though if they think it's preventing the plague spreading?~|~translationMissing
Some will, but don't forget that it was the authorities that supplied the food in the first place. People will soon get angry if they think that not enough care is being taken with the food.~|~translationMissing
Ahh I see, that does make sense. I wonder if I can do something similar in East Ardougne as well.~|~translationMissing
Hey Jethick, got any ideas on how to increase hatred for the king?~|~translationMissing
An increase in taxes would definitely cause some anger, especially if it seems that the king is making personal gain. No one likes the idea of the rich getting richer.~|~translationMissing
Good thinking, what's the best way to spread that sort of news?~|~translationMissing
You could target the citizens themselves but that would be slow going. I'd recommend going for shopkeepers instead, that will impact more people in less time.~|~translationMissing
Great, thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Hey, do you two know of any ways I can cause anger at the king?~|~translationMissing
We did have an idea. With the plague, lots of people are worried for their health. We could take advantage of that.~|~translationMissing
There's not many doctors and nurses around here. You've got Nurse Sarah in West Ardougne and Doctor Orbon in East Ardougne but that's about it.~|~translationMissing
Imagine if the king made a new law stating that all doctors and nurses in Ardougne had to retrain. They'd be out of action for months.~|~translationMissing
People wouldn't like that at all, thanks both.~|~translationMissing
I'm here to tell you about some new taxes.~|~translationMissing
Taxes? Look at this place, do you think I can afford to pay any taxes?~|~translationMissing
Fighting the plague isn't cheap, the money needs to come from somewhere.~|~translationMissing
As if life in this city couldn't get any worse. Where am I going to find the money?~|~translationMissing
That's for you to work out. The first payment is to be collected soon.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing Knight of Ardougne armour~|~translationMissing
A knight wouldn't be telling me this, they're not allowed in West Ardougne. I don't know who you really are, but you should leave.~|~translationMissing
I should probably wear my mourner disguise before doing that.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing either~|~translationMissing
Citizens don't decide new taxes. You should leave.~|~translationMissing
You set fire to the food store.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing? The people need that food!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but we have reason to believe the food is contaminated. This is for the good of everyone.~|~translationMissing
But people will starve!~|~translationMissing
I'm just doing my job. You should take it up with the king if you don't like it.~|~translationMissing
I have some orders from the king for you.~|~translationMissing
Orders?~|~translationMissing
Yes. The king is concerned about the plague spreading into East Ardougne. He has ordered that all doctors and nurses retrain to ensure they are capable of dealing with the plague.~|~translationMissing
But I don't have time to retrain! The people here need me! Who will help them if I'm gone?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure the king considered all of that before making his decision.~|~translationMissing
Well he may be king but he clearly doesn't have a clue about health. This could be disasterous for the city!~|~translationMissing
You knights aren't allowed in West Ardougne. You should leave.~|~translationMissing
I don't take orders from citizens. Now I have work to be doing.~|~translationMissing
You're burning the food! We need that food!~|~translationMissing
We believe the food is contaminated with the plague. This is for your own safety.~|~translationMissing
We'll starve without it though! You can't do this!~|~translationMissing
I already have.~|~translationMissing
I'll make sure everyone hears about this!~|~translationMissing
Chadwell~|~translationMissing
Good day. What can I get you?~|~translationMissing
New taxes? What are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
The plague isn't easy to contain. New funds are needed to help the effort.~|~translationMissing
But I barely make any money here. I can't afford to pay new taxes.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but the king himself gave the order. The first payment is due soon.~|~translationMissing
The people won't allow this to continue!~|~translationMissing
Hang on, I know you knights aren't allowed in West Ardougne. You're an imposter! Get out!~|~translationMissing
And why would a citizen be the one telling me this? Don't waste my time.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Nothing thanks.~|~translationMissing
What do you think you're doing?~|~translationMissing
The king has ordered us to burn this food. It could be contaminated with the plague.~|~translationMissing
But that food is for the people. Without it they will starve!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, just doing my job.~|~translationMissing
A lot of people are going to be angry about this!~|~translationMissing
Silk merchant~|~translationMissing
I buy silk. If you ever want to sell any silk, bring it here.~|~translationMissing
New taxes? What new taxes?~|~translationMissing
Taxes on all market stalls. The order comes from the king himself.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll need to up my prices. A lot of people won't be happy about this.~|~translationMissing
Probably not, but they'll just have to live with it. These taxes are needed for the good of the city. Someone will come to collect the tax from you soon.~|~translationMissing
The king wouldn't send a mourner to tell me this. Go away!~|~translationMissing
The king wouldn't send a citizen to tell me this. Go away!~|~translationMissing
Baker~|~translationMissing
Good day Sir. Would you like some nice freshly baked bread? Or perhaps a nice piece of cake?~|~translationMissing
What are you on about? New taxes?~|~translationMissing
The plague isn't cheap to combat. The king has decreed that new taxes be introduced to help with the funding.~|~translationMissing
I appreciate the need to combat the plague but this is a foolish move. My food feeds a lot of people, they'll be furious to hear about this.~|~translationMissing
Better than getting the plague though. Your first payment is due soon, so you'd better be ready.~|~translationMissing
You mourners may deal with the plague, but I know you have nothing to do with taxes. Now leave me alone!~|~translationMissing
Citizens have nothing to do with taxes. Leave me alone!~|~translationMissing
The king has ordered that new taxes be introduced to help fund the fight against the plague.~|~translationMissing
The food I provide helps to feed this city! People won't be happy when I have to increase my prices!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, it's needed though. The first payment is due soon, make sure you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Just because you mourners handle the plague doesn't mean you get to make new taxes. Go away!~|~translationMissing
Citizens don't deal with taxes. Go away!~|~translationMissing
Silver merchant~|~translationMissing
Silver! Silver! Best prices for buying and selling in all Kandarin!~|~translationMissing
New taxes? What are you on about?~|~translationMissing
The king has called for a tax on luxury items. Your stall is included.~|~translationMissing
Well that is unacceptable! I will have to increase my prices. I've produced silver for the king himself before but don't expect me to do that again!~|~translationMissing
As you wish, but you'll still need to pay. Your first instalment will be collected soon.~|~translationMissing
The king wouldn't send a mourner to tell me this. Clear off!~|~translationMissing
The king wouldn't send a citizen to tell me this. Clear off!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask about the outpost.~|~translationMissing
Gem merchant~|~translationMissing
Here, look at my lovely gems.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Okay.~|~translationMissing
What new taxes?~|~translationMissing
The king has called for a tax on luxury items like the ones you sell.~|~translationMissing
But the king is one of my biggest customers! I hope he realises that I'll have to increase my prices and he won't be exempt from that!~|~translationMissing
I'm sure the king has good reason. I will return to collect your first payment soon.~|~translationMissing
I don't think the king would send a mourner to tell me this. Go away!~|~translationMissing
I don't think the king would send a citizen to tell me this. Go away!~|~translationMissing
Fur trader~|~translationMissing
Would you like to trade in fur?~|~translationMissing
By order of the king, all market stalls are to be taxed to help fund his new castle market.~|~translationMissing
His new castle market? So he's taxing us to help him set up a competing market? This is outrageous!~|~translationMissing
Well he's the king so he can do what he wants. Your first payment will be collected soon.~|~translationMissing
And he sent a mourner to inform us? Go away!~|~translationMissing
And he sent a citizen to inform us? Go away!~|~translationMissing
Spice seller~|~translationMissing
Are you interested in buying or selling spice?~|~translationMissing
Taxes on all market stalls. It's to help fund a new market at the castle.~|~translationMissing
A new market could put me out of business! Why should I help fund it?~|~translationMissing
Because it's the law, refusing to pay is treason. Your first payment is due soon, so I suggest you prepare for it.~|~translationMissing
I will make sure the people hear about this!~|~translationMissing
A mourner wouldn't be sent to tell me this. Go away!~|~translationMissing
A citizen wouldn't be sent to tell me this. Go away!~|~translationMissing
Town Crier~|~translationMissing
Hear ye! Hear ye! Player Moderators massive help to RuneSc-~|~translationMissing
Oh, hello citizen. Are you here to find out about Player Moderators? Or perhaps would you like to know about the laws of the land?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about Player Moderators.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about the Rules of Conduct.~|~translationMissing
Could you help me tell people about some new taxes?~|~translationMissing
New taxes? You know that people won't be happy about that, right?~|~translationMissing
I know, it's the king's orders though. The castle is in need of repairs and more funds are required.~|~translationMissing
As you wish, I will make sure the people know. Just know that I'll be sending them right to the king if they get angry.~|~translationMissing
New taxes? I know that mourners don't have anything to do with taxes. Please allow me to get on with my work.~|~translationMissing
New taxes? A citizen wouldn't have anything to do with taxes. Please allow me to get on with my work.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you give me a handy tip please?~|~translationMissing
Zenesha~|~translationMissing
Hello there! I sell plate mail bodies, are you interested?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm interested.~|~translationMissing
I'm already paying my taxes though?~|~translationMissing
These are new ones. They are to help pay for the king's upcoming visit to Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Well I don't see why I have to pay for that! If the king can't afford the trip, then maybe he shouldn't be going!~|~translationMissing
It's an important diplomatic trip I'm afraid so it has to go ahead. The first payment will be collected soon.~|~translationMissing
And he's getting a mourner to tell me this? Nice try.~|~translationMissing
And he's getting a citizen to tell me this? Nice try.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Sorry, I'm not interested.~|~translationMissing
Estate agent~|~translationMissing
Hello. Welcome to the Gielinor Housing Agency! What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you move my house please?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you redecorate my house please?~|~translationMissing
But the Gielinor Housing Agency doesn't pay taxes here! It's part of our business agreement with the king!~|~translationMissing
These taxes are not included in that agreement. They're new emergency taxes related to the plague.~|~translationMissing
Well this is just no good. If the king does not intend to honour his arrangement with us, we may well take our business elsewhere!~|~translationMissing
You can do that, but while you're in Ardougne you must pay the tax. The first payment will be due soon.~|~translationMissing
And a mourner is the one telling me this. I don't think so.~|~translationMissing
And a citizen is the one telling me this. I don't think so.~|~translationMissing
Probita~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the pet insurance bureau. How can I help you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about pet insurance.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I've lost a pet. Have you got it?~|~translationMissing
What are you on about? I already pay my taxes.~|~translationMissing
The king has ordered some new taxes to help fund his extensive collection of gnomish ornaments. Everyone has to contribute.~|~translationMissing
Gnomish ornaments? Why can't the king pay for his own ornaments? He's got enough money as it is!~|~translationMissing
The law has already been passed so it's not up for debate. Your first payment is expected soon.~|~translationMissing
I'll make sure people hear about this!~|~translationMissing
And why would he send a mourner to tell me this? Stop lying and get out!~|~translationMissing
And why would he send some random citizen to tell me this? Stop lying and get out!~|~translationMissing
Aemad/Kortan~|~translationMissing
Hello there. You've come to the right place if you're looking for adventurer's equipment.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Oh that sounds interesting.~|~translationMissing
The castle is in dire need of repairs, the taxes are to help fund that. They've been ordered by the king himself.~|~translationMissing
Ordered by the king? This is preposterous! We'll have to increase our prices to afford this, people will be furious!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but rules are rules. The first payment is due soon so make sure you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Ordered by the king? What a load of rubbish! You mourners seem to think you own the place. Well you don't! Now clear off!~|~translationMissing
Ordered by the king? What a load of rubbish! I can see you're not one of his people. Stop fooling around and get lost!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No, I've come to the wrong place.~|~translationMissing
Peace be with you, friend.~|~translationMissing
Taxes? But this is a holy church of Saradomin, we are exempt from taxes.~|~translationMissing
More funding is needed to hold back the plague. The church needs to help as well.~|~translationMissing
We'll need to use the donations from the congregation. We were hoping to use that money to build an orphanage for those who lost their parents to the plague.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but the king has given the order. The first payment is due soon.~|~translationMissing
It is not the job of a mourner to deal with taxes. Now, if there's nothing else, I must get to work.~|~translationMissing
It is not the job of a citizen to deal with taxes. Now, if there's nothing else, I must get to work.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Can't stop to talk I'm afraid, I'm very busy right now.~|~translationMissing
The king is concerned about the plague spreading. He has ordered that all doctors and nurses in the city retrain to ensure they are capable of dealing with the plague.~|~translationMissing
Retrain? But that will take months! Who will help the people if there are no doctors around? This is a foolish move!~|~translationMissing
Well the king's word is law so there's little point arguing.~|~translationMissing
Well don't blame me when there's no one to help the king if he falls ill!~|~translationMissing
I don't take orders from citizens. Now I really must get to work.~|~translationMissing
Would you like to buy a drink?~|~translationMissing
Taxes? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
By order of the king, all establishments such as this must now pay an extra beer tax.~|~translationMissing
Beer tax? My patrons work hard for the city of Ardougne! They come here to unwind after a long day. This is plain disrespect to the work they do!~|~translationMissing
It's also plain disrespect to defy the king's laws so you'd better be ready to pay up. We'll be back to collect soon.~|~translationMissing
You haven't heard the last of this!~|~translationMissing
And why would a mourner be telling me this? Clear off!~|~translationMissing
You don't represent the king! Clear off!~|~translationMissing
Richard~|~translationMissing
New taxes? What for?~|~translationMissing
The king has ordered an increase in taxes on all farms in the area. It's due to a lack of care when it comes to the plague.~|~translationMissing
Lack of care? This is about Farmer Brumty and his sheep isn't it? That has nothing to do with us here! Why should we pay for his mistakes?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, it's the word of the king so you'll have to pay up. The first instalment will be collected soon.~|~translationMissing
You mourners may serve the king, but you don't have the power to enforce that. Go away!~|~translationMissing
You don't have the power to enforce that. Go away!~|~translationMissing
New taxes?~|~translationMissing
Yes, they've been ordered by the king to help him buy a new throne.~|~translationMissing
No problem. However, we first need to tax you for your bank usage.~|~translationMissing
Well it's only fair right? You tax us so we tax you.~|~translationMissing
On second thoughts... forget I said anything.~|~translationMissing
Mourners don't deal with taxes. Nice try.~|~translationMissing
Citizens don't deal with taxes. Nice try.~|~translationMissing
That should be enough people recruited, I'd better go and let Elena know.~|~translationMissing
Good work out there. You'd better speak to Elena and Councillor Halgrive, they'll go over the next steps with you.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back [player name], and good work out there. Thanks to you we now have a force that can stand up to Lathas and his armies.~|~translationMissing
Now comes the difficult part though. Before we move against the king, we need to deal with his allies, the mourners.~|~translationMissing
How do we do that?~|~translationMissing
We now significantly outnumber the mourners, we should be able to drive them out of the city. The main focus will be their headquarters. Without their leadership, they'll soon retreat.~|~translationMissing
We have the numbers, but the mourners are better trained and better equipped. You should make sure you're ready before we begin. There will be bloodshed, on both sides.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you're okay with this Elena?~|~translationMissing
I don't like it, but I know it's the only way. I appreciate the concern though, thank you friend.~|~translationMissing
It's necessary bloodshed though.~|~translationMissing
It is, it's just a shame there isn't another way.~|~translationMissing
A bit of blood doesn't scare me.~|~translationMissing
No... But you're not the one I'm worried about.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to begin [player name]?~|~translationMissing
You are about to begin the Battle of West Ardougne. Any items left in the battle, including upon death, will be lost.~|~translationMissing
I will send word around to make sure our people are prepared. Good luck everyone.~|~translationMissing
This is it! The plague of West Ardougne has gone on for long enough, today is the day of plague's end!~|~translationMissing
I need to prepare.~|~translationMissing
Very well, return to us once you are ready.~|~translationMissing
Good work! Let's head downstairs and deal with the rest of them!~|~translationMissing
You! I knew you were trouble! Well don't worry, Lord Iorwerth will learn of your betrayal!~|~translationMissing
We did it! Now we'd better get out of here!~|~translationMissing
Excellent work with those mourners. I suspect the king might be getting a little worried now.~|~translationMissing
We'll need to move fast. He's probably already planning his retaliation.~|~translationMissing
He'll likely expect us to take some time to recuperate after that battle. He won't expect us to hit him right away.~|~translationMissing
So let me guess, that's exactly what we're going to do?~|~translationMissing
Indeed, we hit the castle now before they have a proper chance to prepare for us.~|~translationMissing
Even if they're not prepared, the castle will still be well defended.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but thanks to our victory in West Ardougne, some of the knights are starting to question their loyalties. I've taken advantage of this and made arrangements to ensure the gates are open to us.~|~translationMissing
Make no mistake, it will still be a tough fight, but it's a fight we should be able to win.~|~translationMissing
We can afford to take a little bit of time to ensure everyone has resupplied so feel free to come back later if you're not ready yet. Just don't take too long.~|~translationMissing
Let me know when you are ready to begin [player name].~|~translationMissing
You are about to begin the Battle of East Ardougne. Any items left in the battle, including upon death, will be lost.~|~translationMissing
I never thought this day would come. We're finally going to deal with that traitor once and for all!~|~translationMissing
Let's show him what it means to cross the people of Ardougne!~|~translationMissing
Look's like that's the last of them! Good work everyone!~|~translationMissing
Look who we found hiding in a wardrobe.~|~translationMissing
So you're a coward as well as a traitor! What a pathetic excuse of a man you are.~|~translationMissing
You call me a traitor? I am your king! The traitors here are the ones standing before me.~|~translationMissing
Give it a rest, it's over. We know the truth.~|~translationMissing
And what truth might that be?~|~translationMissing
You let an enemy into our city and covered it up by lying to your people.~|~translationMissing
And I'm sure you'd never do something like that. Don't think I didn't hear about the lies you spread about me.~|~translationMissing
There's also your brother. Murdered on your orders.~|~translationMissing
You are aware that his killer stands with you, are you not?~|~translationMissing
[player name] is innocent in this. You manipulated them for your own gain.~|~translationMissing
Oh don't you go pretending they're innocent! They're nothing more than a mercenary. All they care about is the big pot of gold at the end.~|~translationMissing
They betrayed me! Before long, they'll betray you as well!~|~translationMissing
Liar!~|~translationMissing
Enough! You're finished Lathas. The people will decide your fate. I don't expect them to be kind.~|~translationMissing
[player name], do you have any questions for the king before we take him away? I suspect you won't get another chance to ask them.~|~translationMissing
Why were you helping Lord Iorwerth?~|~translationMissing
My father, King Ulthas, once ruled over a united Kandarin. I was his eldest son, the kingdom was my birthright! But my fool of a father took that from me.~|~translationMissing
When King Arthur and his knights arrived in our lands, my father granted them the castle of Camelot, ousting the loyal subjects that previously lived there.~|~translationMissing
Not only that, but he also declared that the kingdom be jointly ruled by my brother and I, rather than giving it to me as he should have.~|~translationMissing
When I ascended to my half-throne, I promised myself that I would unite this kingdom again, no matter the cost.~|~translationMissing
That's why I made the deal with Lord Iorwerth. In return for access to West Ardougne, he agreed to help me kill my brother and drive out King Arthur.~|~translationMissing
Did you know what the mourners were doing?~|~translationMissing
In West Ardougne? They were searching for some sort of temple. According to Lord Iorwerth, the power there would be essential in summoning Zamorak, the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
So you knowingly allied with a group of Zamorakians?~|~translationMissing
Of course I did! I prayed to Saradomin that he would help unite my kingdom again. He chose not to reply. I turned to the Dark Lord instead.~|~translationMissing
With Zamorak at my side, nothing would stand between me and Camelot!~|~translationMissing
Why did you kill your brother?~|~translationMissing
Last I checked it was you that killed him, not me.~|~translationMissing
You know what I mean.~|~translationMissing
My brother was never meant to rule. The kingdom was mine by birthright! My father chose to give him half the kingdom, and he did a terrible job ruling it.~|~translationMissing
Have you seen West Ardougne? The city is a mess, and not because of the plague. That was my brother's doing. I may be a bad person, but make no mistake, my brother was no hero either.~|~translationMissing
We're done here, take him away.~|~translationMissing
Bring forth the condemned!~|~translationMissing
Citizens of Ardougne! Before you stands Lathas Ardignas~|~translationMissing
a traitor, a murderer and a liar!~|~translationMissing
He has been found guilty of numerous heinous crimes, and will now face judgement for his sins!~|~translationMissing
So this is it. After all this time, Lathas is finally going to pay for what he's done. It's like I should feel something, but I just feel empty.~|~translationMissing
Lathas Ardignas, as decided by the people of Ardougne, you are hereby sentenced to death!~|~translationMissing
Do you have any final words?~|~translationMissing
Lathas~|~translationMissing
How dare you insult me like this! You can't kill me! I am the rightful king! Every person here is under my rule!~|~translationMissing
The people have passed their judgement, you are not a king any more.~|~translationMissing
Then you are all traitors, and you will all pay with your lives!~|~translationMissing
So be it...~|~translationMissing
In the name of Zamorak I curse you, each and every one of you!~|~translationMissing
Lathas is killed by the executioner, and two Hooded Figures knock the player and Elena out.~|~translationMissing
Well hello again adventurer! How are you today?~|~translationMissing
Fine thank you. And yourself?~|~translationMissing
Not too bad, I've a lot to do though. King Lathas left plenty of things for us to clean up.~|~translationMissing
So you finally decided to show your true colours, how disappointing.~|~translationMissing
We should have killed them both when we had the chance.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, perhaps.~|~translationMissing
You know, after you killed King Tyras, I thought you might have some potential. Given time, we might have properly welcomed you into our ranks. You'd have been the first human among us.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm glad to have disappointed you. I don't work with murderers.~|~translationMissing
No? You seemed more than happy to kill King Tyras when it suited you. Burnt him alive in the middle of his own camp if I recall.~|~translationMissing
[player name] is innocent! You lied to them!~|~translationMissing
Lied? I told your friend here that King Tyras was an invader into our lands. Last time I checked, that was the truth.~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but you conveniently missed out the part about you trying to summon the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see you have been led astray. You think we are the evil ones, but our cause is the true one. You think we are murderers, but we are in fact saviours.~|~translationMissing
You think you're the hero of this story, but you're not...~|~translationMissing
You're mad!~|~translationMissing
Let me deal with them, my lord. They've caused us enough trouble.~|~translationMissing
They may still be of use to us. Lock them away for now. Give them time to think on their choices.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, as you wish.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn and several Rebel Archers appear, killing some of the Iorwerth soldiers.~|~translationMissing
That's enough Lord Iorwerth, let them go!~|~translationMissing
Brave of you to come here Arianwyn, but foolish. We have you outnumbered.~|~translationMissing
Don't be so sure. We fight with the strength of ten of your warriors.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps, but I don't believe you're the type to throw lives away without need. Instead, why don't we discuss this like reasonable people.~|~translationMissing
We don't have anything to discuss with you, you Zamorakian scum!~|~translationMissing
Zamorakian? You don't really think we'd support that monster do you? I'm afraid to say that you're quite mistaken.~|~translationMissing
Don't try to manipulate us with your lies. We know all about your plot with King Lathas to summon the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
Ah, that. Well now that King Lathas is dead, I suppose there's no better time to reveal the truth.~|~translationMissing
It was just a ruse I'm afraid. A lie we told King Lathas to get him on our side.~|~translationMissing
We needed access to West Ardougne so we needed the support of the king. Once we found out about his hidden worship of Zamorak, it seemed like an obvious lie to tell.~|~translationMissing
I have no more love for Zamorak than you do. I've only ever served one god, the same one as you, Seren.~|~translationMissing
You're lying! You wanted to use the Temple of Light to summon Zamorak!~|~translationMissing
I can see why you'd think that, but you are mistaken. You're right to say that the temple is key to summoning a god, but that god is not Zamorak, it's Seren.~|~translationMissing
That's impossible! Seren is dead!~|~translationMissing
I thought the same once. That was until I managed to break one of the seals within the Grand Library.~|~translationMissing
That's how I discovered the truth. A part of Seren lives on, trapped within the Temple of Light.~|~translationMissing
I don't believe you!~|~translationMissing
A shame. You're better than this Arianwyn, I hope in time you will see that.~|~translationMissing
What should we do with them, my lord.~|~translationMissing
Let them go. Let it be known that the Iorwerth clan is not without mercy.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure about this?~|~translationMissing
Yes. But make no mistake Arianwyn, if you and your rebels interfere with our affairs again, I will not be so forgiving.~|~translationMissing
Now, I suggest you leave, before I change my mind.~|~translationMissing
This isn't over!~|~translationMissing
The player, Elena, Arianwyn and the rebels leave.~|~translationMissing
This is a bad idea.~|~translationMissing
Don't be so sure. They may not know it yet, but the rebels could be of great use to us...~|~translationMissing
Ah [player name], there you are. We thought it best to let you rest for a bit after everything that happened earlier.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Arianwyn, I definitely needed it. And thank you for saving us back there, I don't know what we'd have done if you hadn't shown up.~|~translationMissing
I suspect you wouldn't have been around to have this conversation. You played a dangerous game in Ardougne. I fear you may not have considered the outcome of that.~|~translationMissing
People were dying Arianwyn, we couldn't do nothing.~|~translationMissing
Of course not, but we have no idea how Lord Iorwerth will respond to this. The things he said when we freed you were... concerning...~|~translationMissing
You can say that again. What do you think he meant by it all?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. It's something that we should discuss with the others.~|~translationMissing
Could you do me a favour and fetch Ysgawyn. He's probably on the upper platforms. You should bring your friend Elena as well. I'm not sure where she is I'm afraid, Ysgawyn might know though.~|~translationMissing
Are you Ysgawyn?~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn~|~translationMissing
I am, what of it human?~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn has called a meeting. He asked me to come fetch you.~|~translationMissing
I see, so now I'm meant to follow the orders of a human.~|~translationMissing
It wasn't an order, it was just...~|~translationMissing
Make no mistake human, you may have Arianwyn and the others fooled but I know what you are.~|~translationMissing
I don't know what you mean...~|~translationMissing
You're a menace. You claim you're here to help, but everywhere you go you leave a trail of bodies behind.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'll come to this meeting, I'm in no place to deny Arianwyn. Just stay out of my way from here on out.~|~translationMissing
Fine. Before you go, do you know where Elena is?~|~translationMissing
The other human? I think she's by the pond to the south west. Now if you'll excuse me...~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn leaves for the meeting.~|~translationMissing
Well... he was nice.~|~translationMissing
So how are you doing, Elena?~|~translationMissing
I'm okay. So much has happened so fast, it's a lot to take in.~|~translationMissing
It is. I'm here for you if you need me though.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, that means a lot.~|~translationMissing
You'll get used to it.~|~translationMissing
I guess... I just don't know if I want to.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, it's no small thing.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I wanted to ask you something.~|~translationMissing
The people of Ardougne, the elves here, you've spent a lot of time helping them. Why? What drives you, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I care about helping people.~|~translationMissing
So even if you knew that you'd get nothing out of it yourself, you'd still continue to help these elves?~|~translationMissing
I suspect not many people would feel that way.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm not like other people.~|~translationMissing
Clearly. Thank you for answering, I realise it's a pretty pointless question. I was curious to know how you felt though.~|~translationMissing
Well a reward's always nice, but yes.~|~translationMissing
I guess it's always nice to be rewarded. It's good to know that isn't all that matters to you though. I suspect not many people would feel that way.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I think I'd want a reward.~|~translationMissing
I guess it's always nice to be rewarded. You should be careful not to let that drive you though. Money can't buy everything, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Well I've rambled on enough. Was there something you needed?~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn has called a meeting. He'd like you to attend.~|~translationMissing
I'd better head over there then.~|~translationMissing
Elena leaves for the meeting.~|~translationMissing
People reward me for helping them.~|~translationMissing
So if you didn't think you'd get a reward, you'd stop helping these elves?~|~translationMissing
Yes, the reward is what matters.~|~translationMissing
You should be careful of letting that drive you. Money can't buy everything, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Actually, I think I'd still help.~|~translationMissing
So it's not just about the reward after all. It's nice to know that isn't all that matters to you. I suspect not many people would feel that way.~|~translationMissing
I need to fix my mistakes.~|~translationMissing
So it's about what happened with King Tyras? Do you think you'd still help these elves if that hadn't happened?~|~translationMissing
So it's not just guilt that's driving you, that's good to know. What happened with King Tyras was awful but you can't take too much blame, Lathas manipulated you.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't think I would.~|~translationMissing
So the only thing driving you is guilt? That doesn't seem healthy. Be careful that you don't carry the world on your shoulders, [player name]. It's not your fault that Lathas manipulated you.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, not something you've had to think about I guess. Just make sure that you don't carry the world on your shoulders, [player name]. It's not your fault that Lathas manipulated you.~|~translationMissing
I know, thanks Elena.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I've rambled on enough. Was there something you needed?~|~translationMissing
I'd better head over there then. Thanks for the talk.~|~translationMissing
It's my duty to help people.~|~translationMissing
Be careful of hiding behind duty, it won't stop people holding you accountable for your actions.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, not something you've had to think about I guess. It's worth considering though. We should all have something to drive us.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, was there something you needed?~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Was there something you needed?~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. You should talk to Arianwyn when you're ready to begin.~|~translationMissing
Hey, I wanted to ask you...~|~translationMissing
No. Go away and talk to Arianwyn instead.~|~translationMissing
Ilfeen~|~translationMissing
Hey there. You should let Arianwyn know once you're ready to get started.~|~translationMissing
Hey there [player name]. Arianwyn's leading this meeting so you should let him know when you're ready to start.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you [player name]. You should speak to Arianwyn when you're ready to begin.~|~translationMissing
Right, now that we're all here, let's get started.~|~translationMissing
So, as I'm sure you've all heard, King Lathas of Ardougne is dead. He was overthrown by his subjects and executed soon afterwards.~|~translationMissing
That's not all though, the mourners of West Ardougne have been driven out of the city. Lord Iorwerth no longer has any presence in Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
Let's not ignore the obvious, Arianwyn. Our supposed ally, [player name], helped lead the uprising. His actions may well have endangered us all.~|~translationMissing
But surely this is a good thing? With Ardougne lost to him, Lord Iorwerth no longer has access to the Temple of Light. Without that, he has no way to summon the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
The temple was already secure. All this uprising has achieved is to anger the enemy.~|~translationMissing
You say that like it's a bad thing, Ysgawyn. Last time I checked, we didn't care about upsetting our foe.~|~translationMissing
I care about keeping our people alive, Islwyn!~|~translationMissing
And what about our people? While you sat here in your secure little village, we took action! We saved lives! But I guess you're too selfish to care about us.~|~translationMissing
Selfish? How dare you! You know nothing of the plight of the elves, girl. You'd do well to keep your mouth shut!~|~translationMissing
That's enough Ysgawyn. We can debate what's happened for days and still reach no conclusion. That is not why I called you all here. Instead, we need to plan what happens next.~|~translationMissing
Now, while freeing [player name] and Elena from the Iorwerth camp, we were confronted by Lord Iorwerth. He could have killed us all, but he let us go.~|~translationMissing
He let you go? Why?~|~translationMissing
His reasoning was disturbing. For a long time now, we've believed that Lord Iorwerth has been trying to summon Zamorak, the Dark Lord. However, he claimed otherwise.~|~translationMissing
But if not Zamorak, then who?~|~translationMissing
Seren.~|~translationMissing
Seren? But that's impossible, Seren is gone.~|~translationMissing
He seems to think otherwise. He claimed that a part of Seren still lives, trapped within the Temple of Light. Apparently, he discovered this by breaking one of the nine seals within the Grand Library.~|~translationMissing
That's impossible. He must be lying.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by all of this. Who's Seren? What library?~|~translationMissing
Seren was our goddess, our guardian and our teacher. Everything we have, we owe to her. She helped us build the great city of Prifddinas, a place where all elves could live in harmony.~|~translationMissing
At the end of the God Wars, the gods were banished from this world. Seren didn't want to leave us though, she couldn't. She shattered herself into thousands of crystals. Those crystals are all we have left of her now.~|~translationMissing
I see, I'm sorry to hear that.~|~translationMissing
As for the Grand Library, it was a great archive of knowledge beneath Prifddinas. Pretty much everything there was open to all of elven kind.~|~translationMissing
There was an exception to that though, the nine seals of Seren. The seals guarded the forbidden knowledge, that which only Seren herself could access.~|~translationMissing
And Lord Iorwerth managed to break one of these seals.~|~translationMissing
So he claims...~|~translationMissing
Is there no way we can check?~|~translationMissing
No. Prifddinas was lost to us. When Lord Iorwerth first took control of the city, my grandfather, Baxtorian, led an army to try and stop him.~|~translationMissing
When that failed, Baxtorian and the other clan elders made one final ditch attempt to save Prifddinas. They sung the song of inversion to revert the entire city to a crystal seed.~|~translationMissing
Their plan worked, and the city was lost to Lord Iorwerth. However, it was lost to the rest of us as well, the Grand Library with it.~|~translationMissing
What happened to Baxtorian?~|~translationMissing
While he was fighting Lord Iorwerth, invaders took control of our kingdom to the east. They kidnapped Glarial, Baxtorian's wife.~|~translationMissing
Unable to find her, he sealed himself beneath the waterfall where they lived, never to be seen again.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian was king of the elves back then. Do you think he had access to the forbidden knowledge?~|~translationMissing
It's not impossible I suppose. If anyone, it would have been him. Baxtorian was closer to Seren than any other elf, it's one of the reasons he was chosen to become king.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian is gone though, even if he knew something, he can't help us now.~|~translationMissing
Don't be so sure. I never knew my grandfather, but my mother always told me that he wasn't the type for taking chances. If he knew something important, he'd have made sure it wouldn't have been lost with him.~|~translationMissing
We can't possibly make a plan without knowing Lord Iorwerth's intentions. While unlikely to be true, this stuff about the library is all we have to go on.~|~translationMissing
If Baxtorian left behind anything that could help us, we should try to find it.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian kept everything of importance to him at his home within Baxtorian Falls. If we're going to find anything, it's probably there.~|~translationMissing
[player name], you've been to Baxtorian Falls multiple times. You're the best person to take the lead on this.~|~translationMissing
You trust the human with this?~|~translationMissing
Let go of your pride, Ysgawyn. [player name] has proven his worth to us.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to accompany you on this one [player name], it might be useful to have an elf with you.~|~translationMissing
Before her death, my mother passed down a book to me. It was written by my grandfather for his wife. You should take it with you. It might contain something of use.~|~translationMissing
Thank you Islwyn. While we're gone, the rest of you should focus on Lord Iorwerth. See if you can get any idea on what he's planning now that he's lost Ardougne. Just be careful.~|~translationMissing
We always are. Good luck to you both.~|~translationMissing
And you. Let's get started.~|~translationMissing
The others leave the meeting.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for agreeing to help us, [player name]. We owe a lot to you, even if some of us don't show it very well.~|~translationMissing
You mean Ysgawyn? He is a bit rude.~|~translationMissing
Try not to be too judgemental. Ysgawyn's husband was killed by Essyllt, one of Lord Iorwerth's henchmen. Ysgawyn's never really been the same since.~|~translationMissing
I've met Essyllt, he was the one in charge of the mourners in West Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
He's a nasty piece of work. If you try hard enough, you can find something redeemable about most elves, even those that serve Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
But Essyllt... He seems to take joy in the suffering of others, especially those unable to defend themselves.~|~translationMissing
Enough about him though, we need to focus on Baxtorian Falls. I suggest we travel seperately, we can't be too careful at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Makes sense, will you be okay getting there on your own?~|~translationMissing
I'm no expert on your lands but I should be fine. I just have a few things to gather before I depart.~|~translationMissing
Well in that case, I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
I just have a few things to gather before I depart for Baxtorian Falls. I'll meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good, see you there.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. Good to see you.~|~translationMissing
Pretty good. I've been thinking about that elf, Ysgawyn.~|~translationMissing
Bit of an angry guy isn't he?~|~translationMissing
That's one way to put it. I can't say I approve of his attitude, but I appreciate he's seen a lot in this war.~|~translationMissing
It's interesting, the elves have such long lifespans, we're just children compared to them. And yet, even with all their experience, they're still just as fickle as we are.~|~translationMissing
I find most races are the same to be honest.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, had any luck with Baxtorian Falls?~|~translationMissing
I'll let you crack on then. We'll talk more later.~|~translationMissing
No. Go away.~|~translationMissing
Hello there [player name], glad to see you made it here okay.~|~translationMissing
You as well Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
I must say, it feels strange to be back here, especially after all of this time.~|~translationMissing
You've been here before?~|~translationMissing
A long time ago...~|~translationMissing
I was one of the elves born in Baxtorian's new kingdom. My family were close relations of Baxtorian, he invited us here a few times.~|~translationMissing
Those were simpler times, happier times. After Baxtorian left to try and retake Prifddinas, my parents were among those who joined him. They never returned. I was still just a child at the time, alone and afraid.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to hear that Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
This war has taken so much... From my people, and from yours. I'd give anything to see peace, anything to finally see Prifddinas with my own eyes.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, now's not the time for this. We need to see if Baxtorian left anything of use behind.~|~translationMissing
Here's that book that Islwyn gave us. Hopefully it has something of use in it.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn tries to give you a book but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn gives you a book.~|~translationMissing
Do you believe what Lord Iorwerth said about Seren?~|~translationMissing
To be honest... I really don't know. It seems impossible, and yet...~|~translationMissing
No. It's just me being wishful. He's lying, he has to be.~|~translationMissing
Wishful?~|~translationMissing
By the time I was born, Seren was already gone from this world. All I know of her is the stories my parents told me.~|~translationMissing
You wish you could have met her?~|~translationMissing
I do, but that doesn't mean I should fall for the lies of Lord Iorwerth. Seren is gone, nothing can ever bring her back.~|~translationMissing
Do you think we'll find anything to help us here?~|~translationMissing
I won't lie, we're clutching straws here. We have nothing else to go on though, so we have to try.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian was once king of the elves, anything he left behind might be of use.~|~translationMissing
I'll crack on.~|~translationMissing
We need to see if Baxtorian left anything of use behind. Maybe that book will be of use.~|~translationMissing
You place the Adamant chainbody on the pillar. It disappears in a puff of smoke.~|~translationMissing
You place the Wine of zamorak on the pillar. It disappears in a puff of smoke.~|~translationMissing
You place the Nature rune on the pillar. It disappears in a puff of smoke.~|~translationMissing
You place the Black dagger on the pillar. It disappears in a puff of smoke.~|~translationMissing
You place the Cabbage on the pillar. It disappears in a puff of smoke.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian~|~translationMissing
Glarial! I... oh...~|~translationMissing
I'm [player name] and this is Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn... I remember that name. You grew up in my kingdom... I'm sorry about your family.~|~translationMissing
Don't be your majesty...~|~translationMissing
I appreciate the sentiment, but please, I am no king anymore.~|~translationMissing
Now I must ask... Glarial... Is there any news?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry but... she's gone.~|~translationMissing
I... I see... It was always a lot to hope for...~|~translationMissing
If it's any consolation, [player name] moved her remains here, to be closer to you.~|~translationMissing
That... That means a lot. Thank you. It is good to see that some humans still see elves as friends.~|~translationMissing
If you need time...~|~translationMissing
No... I feel I've spent long enough here.~|~translationMissing
Then I can take you back to Lletya. Your grandson, Islwyn, is there.~|~translationMissing
Grandson? So Eirlys had a child? Does she still live as well?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not... I'm sorry.~|~translationMissing
No father should outlive their child. Forgive me Eirlys.~|~translationMissing
Please, let us leave now. There is too much sadness for me here, too much pain. Once we arrive, you must tell me everything that has happened in my absence.~|~translationMissing
Very well, I will teleport us back to Lletya. You'll have to make your own way back I'm afraid, [player name].~|~translationMissing
No problem. See you soon.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn teleports himself and Baxtorian back to Lletya.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hello there. You'd probably best talk to Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to ask you something about yourself.~|~translationMissing
I see... Go ahead.~|~translationMissing
Why did you seal yourself away?~|~translationMissing
My Glarial... She mattered more to me than anything else, but she was lost to me. The enemy took her, so I searched far and wide to find her again.~|~translationMissing
At times I came close, but in the end, I was too weak to carry on. I knew there was a chance she may live though, so I sealed myself away, hoping she would be the one to wake me.~|~translationMissing
I see. I'm sorry.~|~translationMissing
I thank you friend, but please, don't be. The burden is mine to bear.~|~translationMissing
What happened between you and Lord Iorwerth?~|~translationMissing
To be honest, even today I know little of him. When I left Prifddinas to expand our kingdom into the east, he was but a child, with the Iorwerth clan ruled by his mother.~|~translationMissing
The first time I properly met him was after I heard about his takeover of the city. I led my forces through the Underground Pass and confronted him at the city gates.~|~translationMissing
I tried to reason with him, but he had already decided that I was his enemy. We had the numbers and our forces were better skilled, so we tried to besiege the city.~|~translationMissing
The Iorwerth forces had the strength and safety of the city walls though. They slowly whittled us down until we were too weak to carry on. We had no choice but to retreat.~|~translationMissing
We fell back into the Underground Pass, intending to return to our kingdom in the east. Lord Iorwerth sent his forces in after us, hoping to wipe us out.~|~translationMissing
We no longer had the strength in numbers, but we still outmatched the Iorwerth troops in skill and experience. We fought back while we retreated. Both sides suffered huge losses.~|~translationMissing
Eventually we managed to make it through to the other side. By then, there were few of us left. Lord Iorwerth had failed to wipe us out, but he knew we were beaten.~|~translationMissing
While we were gone, an uprising had occurred in the eastern kingdom. We took our best fighters to Prifddinas, those that remained were unable to hold back the enemy.~|~translationMissing
My wife was taken and most of my people were slaughtered. I turned my attention to finding my wife and getting the rest of my people to safety.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth became the least of my problems. I suspect he didn't consider me much of a threat at that point anyway.~|~translationMissing
What was Seren like?~|~translationMissing
She... She was wonderful. She taught us to better ourselves in every way possible. Everything we know, everything we are, it all came from her.~|~translationMissing
I wish I could have met her.~|~translationMissing
I feel very blessed to have been able to. The love she had for us, it's unlike anything I've ever seen.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like she was pretty much perfect.~|~translationMissing
Well... not quite. Many of the elves alive now were not around when Seren was still with us. They only know her through the stories passed down to them. The stories don't tell everything though.~|~translationMissing
Seren was remarkable, but under the surface, she hid a great pain. A sadness unlike any other. She never spoke of it, but when you looked hard enough, you could see the anguish.~|~translationMissing
I guess we all have our demons, even the gods. Seren was a beacon of light in this grim world, but the brightest light casts the darkest shadow, and none shone brighter than her.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of the current elves?~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn and the rebels have done well to keep going for this long. They've been fighting this war for centuries, and yet they've never given up. I have much respect for them, they're far stronger than I ever was.~|~translationMissing
Most of them are still young though. They lack the wisdom of the older elves, the ones who were around when Seren still walked this earth. Many of them never saw Prifddinas before the song of inversion.~|~translationMissing
Is that a bad thing?~|~translationMissing
Not necessarily, but it is something to be cautious of. That which they fight for, it's a mere dream to them. They should remember that dreams seldom come true.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back [player name]. While you were gone, I filled Baxtorian in on everything that has happened. I also took the liberty of calling the others here, so that we can discuss our next move.~|~translationMissing
You also missed out on Islwyn getting to meet his grandfather for the first time. I think he might have cried a little.~|~translationMissing
Cried? In your dreams Eluned.~|~translationMissing
I appreciate we're all happy to have Baxtorian back with us, but let's not get distracted.~|~translationMissing
Apologies, Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
Right, over to you Baxtorian.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Arianwyn. I... Forgive me, it's been a long time since I last chaired a meeting like this. Much has changed since then as well.~|~translationMissing
Take your time.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn has informed me of Lord Iorwerth's revelation...~|~translationMissing
Do you believe his claims?~|~translationMissing
About Seren? No. As for him breaking a seal in the Grand Library... I... do not know.~|~translationMissing
You don't know? What do you mean you don't know?~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn...~|~translationMissing
I know not what the seals hide. What I do know is that they could, in theory, be broken.~|~translationMissing
I was lucky enough to be trusted by Seren. She confided in me many times. She never told me what knowledge the seals guard, but she did tell me that they could be destroyed.~|~translationMissing
I don't know exactly. She said that those who follow the light would be able to access her knowledge.~|~translationMissing
And that's it? This gives us nothing to go on.~|~translationMissing
Not nothing. We now know that the seals can be destroyed, which means Lord Iorwerth could have spoken the truth.~|~translationMissing
But without access to the Grand Library, we have no way to be sure.~|~translationMissing
Well... we might still have a way.~|~translationMissing
A way to access the library?~|~translationMissing
Yes... Prifddinas may have been reverted to seed, but it does still exist.~|~translationMissing
You're not suggesting we restore the city are you? Even if we could, Lord Iorwerth would instantly take it.~|~translationMissing
No. While Lord Iorwerth is at large, Prifddinas must remain as it is. However, there may be a way to still enter the city.~|~translationMissing
You don't mean entering the crystal do you?~|~translationMissing
That's not possible.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I think it would be possible. The crystal seed that contains Prifddinas, it's not the same as the seeds we use to form weapons and armour.~|~translationMissing
The seed contains Prifddinas, but the seed itself is not the city.~|~translationMissing
So it's like a box?~|~translationMissing
Exactly, and if we can enter the box...~|~translationMissing
We can enter Prifddinas!~|~translationMissing
That's the idea. It won't be straightforward though.~|~translationMissing
Is it ever?~|~translationMissing
We will need a special potion to be able to safely enter the crystal seed. We'll also need to be able to bypass the defences around it as well.~|~translationMissing
A potion? Sounds like my area of expertise.~|~translationMissing
Perfect. Elena, if you could help create this potion, that would be greatly appreciated. The rest of us can work on those defences.~|~translationMissing
Right. [player name], meet me by the pond. I could use your help with this.~|~translationMissing
What do I need to do now?~|~translationMissing
I've given Elena the information she needs to make that potion. You should speak to her by the pond.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian has given Elena the information she needs to make this potion. You should speak to her by the pond.~|~translationMissing
If you chose "Maybe later." when she wanted to ask you something before the first meeting~|~translationMissing
If you chose "Go ahead." and picked the full options when she wanted to ask you something before the first meeting~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. Glad everything went okay at Baxtorian Falls.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. Anything exciting happen while I was gone?~|~translationMissing
Nope, all nice and quiet for a change.~|~translationMissing
Good to hear.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian is an interesting one, isn't he?~|~translationMissing
He does seem a bit...~|~translationMissing
Lost?~|~translationMissing
He reminds me of a story my father once told me. A story of a broken man.~|~translationMissing
What was the story?~|~translationMissing
A long time ago, there were two brothers living in Avarrocka. They lived a simple life, farming the land and selling the produce to people in the city.~|~translationMissing
When war came to the city, the king ordered that every able-bodied man take up arms against the enemy. The two brothers had to leave their home behind, to fight for a king they'd never met.~|~translationMissing
Like everyone else, they were given basic weapons and basic training. Enough to give them a chance, but not a big one. When the fighting started, they were poorly equipped and poorly prepared.~|~translationMissing
They fought in many battles. Battles in strange places against strange people. As the war dragged on, they saw more and more horrors, from both sides. The only thing that kept them going was each other.~|~translationMissing
As the war drew to a close, they were called to one final battle. The enemy knew they were losing, and they fought more ferociously than ever before.~|~translationMissing
That was where it happened. One of the brothers was cut off and surrounded. He tried to fight back, but he didn't stand a chance.~|~translationMissing
Eventually the fighting stopped, and the war was over. The other brother could finally go home. But the truth is, he had nothing to go home to.~|~translationMissing
It wasn't the farm that mattered, not really. The thing that mattered to him was gone.~|~translationMissing
In a way, he'd died back on the battlefield alongside his brother. Left in his place was just a broken man, with nothing left to live for.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. And you think Baxtorian is like this broken man?~|~translationMissing
He lost his wife, his people and his kingdom. Now he's in a strange place, surrounded by strange people, helping to fight a war that he lost a long time ago.~|~translationMissing
Now's not the time for stories, Elena.~|~translationMissing
I guess you're right. The short of it is, Baxtorian has lost everything that he cared about. He's just an empty shell now, with nothing left to live for.~|~translationMissing
Maybe he's not totally lost. He still has Islwyn, and we can still turn this war around.~|~translationMissing
Maybe. I guess only time will tell.~|~translationMissing
Right. Shall we get started with this potion?~|~translationMissing
What do we need?~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian gave me the details. To start with, we need an elder cadantine herb. We should be able to grow one from a normal cadantine seed, we just need to prepare the patch a little differently.~|~translationMissing
The elves have said we can use this farming patch here. While I prepare the patch, could you go and fetch a cadantine seed and a seed dibber?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a Cadantine seed~|~translationMissing
I already have the seed here.~|~translationMissing
Well it also happens that I've actually already prepared the patch, so you can get started right away.~|~translationMissing
How convenient.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. When you're ready, go ahead and plant the seed.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a Cadantine seed~|~translationMissing
Will do, I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. Do you have that seed yet?~|~translationMissing
It's a cadantine seed that we need. Let me know once you have one. You'll want to get a seed dibber as well so we can plant it.~|~translationMissing
Great. The patch is all prepared so just plant it when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
That's the seed planted.~|~translationMissing
Great. I'll keep an eye on the patch while it grows. You should check in with Arianwyn and Baxtorian in the meantime.~|~translationMissing
Okay, see you later.~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name], how's the potion going?~|~translationMissing
We've planted the herb we need, now we have to wait for it to grow. Is there something I can do in the meantime?~|~translationMissing
I suspect there is. Myself and Baxtorian have been looking over how we can get past the defences around the crystal seed.~|~translationMissing
What defences are there?~|~translationMissing
The crystal seed containing Prifddinas, it lies in the middle of the clearing where the city once stood. The only thing left of the city itself are the walls.~|~translationMissing
These are no ordinary walls though. Long ago, they were reinforced by various enchantments to protect Prifddinas during the God Wars.~|~translationMissing
With Prifddinas gone, Lord Iorwerth has claimed the land where it once was. He's managed to manipulate the defences to only allow his allies to enter.~|~translationMissing
So how do we get past them?~|~translationMissing
While the Iorwerth clan may hold some magical knowledge... they are not mystics. I have no doubt that their work was crude at best, work that a true master of the magical arts could overcome.~|~translationMissing
I see. And where do we find a true master of the magical arts?~|~translationMissing
There were eight separate elven clans that journeyed with Seren to this world. Those eight clans still exist today, with each elf born into one of them.~|~translationMissing
You'll have already heard of some of the clans. The Iorwerth clan is known to you, the traitorous clan of assassins and slayers.~|~translationMissing
And the Cadarn clan of course, the warrior clan of which myself and Arianwyn are part of.~|~translationMissing
The other clans you might be less familiar with. However, one of those clans is key here, the Amlodd clan, the clan of mystics.~|~translationMissing
It was the Amlodd clan who created the Prifddinas defences. Their clan should have the knowledge needed to overcome them. And of all the Amlodd clan, none know more than Lord Ieuan Amlodd himself.~|~translationMissing
And where do we find him?~|~translationMissing
After Prifddinas was reverted to seed, the clan elders went into hiding. Before we parted ways, the others did leave me with some clues on how to find them.~|~translationMissing
Lord Amlodd may be our priority, but the other elders could be of great help in our fight against Lord Iorwerth. We should try and find them all.~|~translationMissing
I've managed to decipher the clue left behind by Lord Amlodd. We should be able to use it to find him. I've also started work on the other clues.~|~translationMissing
Apart from Lord Amlodd, I've only been able to decipher Lady Trahaearn's clue so far. I'll keep working on the others though.~|~translationMissing
[player name], myself and Baxtorian will continue to work on deciphering these clues. While we do, it would be of great help if you could find Lord Amlodd and Lady Trahaearn for us.~|~translationMissing
How do I find Lord Amlodd?~|~translationMissing
Here is the clue he left behind~|~translationMissing
'The elven crystal will lead you to me.'~|~translationMissing
I see, anything else I should know?~|~translationMissing
The Amlodd clan is a clan of mystics. Some sort of magic may be key to finding Lord Amlodd. You might also find this of use, Lord Amlodd gave it to me before we went our seperate ways.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian tries to give you a crystal seed but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian gives you a crystal seed.~|~translationMissing
How do I find Lady Trahaearn?~|~translationMissing
Here is the clue she left behind~|~translationMissing
'I will journey south from the well.'~|~translationMissing
The Trahaearn clan is a clan of smiths and miners. It's possible that you'll need to use your smithing and mining skills to find Lady Trahaearn.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll get started.~|~translationMissing
We need you to find Lord Amlodd and Lady Trahaearn for us. Speak to Baxtorian, he can tell you about the clues they left behind.~|~translationMissing
It's a small crystal seed. It looks to be inactive. It will need enchanting before it can do anything.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, how is it going?~|~translationMissing
Not bad, thank you.~|~translationMissing
It's good to have you helping us. We're all very grateful.~|~translationMissing
I have a seed from Baxtorian that I think needs enchanting.~|~translationMissing
Okay, let me see what I can do with it.~|~translationMissing
There you go. Be careful with it, I'm not sure what it will do when used.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the warning, see you later.~|~translationMissing
It's the least I can do. I'll see you later.~|~translationMissing
The player rubs the seed, arriving at the Enchanted Valley next to a Mysterious Figure.~|~translationMissing
Look at this place... It's beautiful, is it not?~|~translationMissing
Are you Lord Amlodd?~|~translationMissing
Amlodd? A curious name... Why do you ask?~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian sent me. He gave me a crystal that belonged to Lord Amlodd. It brought me here, to you.~|~translationMissing
To me? I see...~|~translationMissing
I have a question for you. This valley before us, how would you describe it?~|~translationMissing
Beautiful.~|~translationMissing
Yes... It's nice to look upon such beauty, it reminds me of my home. The crystal spires of Prifddinas.~|~translationMissing
Dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Yes... This world... it's so peaceful, so beautiful. But there is still danger here. It takes me back to the forests near my home, before Lord Iorwerth brought a different danger upon us.~|~translationMissing
Peaceful.~|~translationMissing
Yes... It is a welcome break from the wars of my home, the wars of Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
Boring.~|~translationMissing
I suppose it can seem that way. Little to see and little to do. But there is beauty in that simplicity, much like the forest of Isafdar.~|~translationMissing
The answers are not always easy to find. I have had time to reflect here, to consider this world. Maybe you need more time to find your own answer. Alas, it is time we do not have, for Lord Iorwerth awaits.~|~translationMissing
So you are Lord Amlodd?~|~translationMissing
Lord Ieuan Amlodd~|~translationMissing
Indeed, and if Baxtorian sent you, then it is time for me to leave this place. Tell me human, where must I travel to?~|~translationMissing
The village of Lletya, in the forest of Isafdar.~|~translationMissing
Then we shall leave at once. Allow me to teleport you back with me.~|~translationMissing
Lord Amlodd teleports you both back to Lletya.~|~translationMissing
The rebels have created a wonderful village here. A safe refuge from the tyranny of Lord Iorwerth. Curious how something so beautiful could be born of something so terrible.~|~translationMissing
They've done well to keep up the fight for this long.~|~translationMissing
They have, but I'd expect no less of them. The song of the elves has been sung for thousands of years, it will continue for thousands more.~|~translationMissing
However, I fear that this verse is the darkest yet.~|~translationMissing
She seems to be in a deep sleep. She's wearing a strange exoskeleton made from runite. The exoskeleton is damaged and needs repairing.~|~translationMissing
You successfully repair the exoskeleton.~|~translationMissing
Lady Tangwen Trahaearn~|~translationMissing
Who has awoken me? A human? You are not who I expected.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian sent me. We need your help in the fight against Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian lives? And he is working with a human? This is most irregular. I see you repaired my exoskeleton as well. Impressive work for a human, but again, most irregular.~|~translationMissing
Tell me human, where is Baxtorian?~|~translationMissing
He's in the elven village of Lletya, south of here.~|~translationMissing
Then I will journey there at once. There is clearly a lot I need to catch up on.~|~translationMissing
Lady Trahaearn departs for Lletya.~|~translationMissing
These rebels had better get a move on and defeat Lord Iorwerth. Old ladies like me have a tendency to drop dead, and I'll be very annoyed if that happens before I see Prifddinas again.~|~translationMissing
How can you be annoyed if you're dead?~|~translationMissing
Oh I'll cook up quite the storm in the afterlife, believe me.~|~translationMissing
Good job finding Lord Amlodd and Lady Trahaearn. Now, you should probably go see how that seed you planted is doing.~|~translationMissing
Good idea, I'll go see Elena.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hello there. Thank you for finding Lord Amlodd and Lady Trahaearn.~|~translationMissing
My pleasure.~|~translationMissing
Have you checked in with Elena recently? That seed has probably grown by now.~|~translationMissing
I'll go talk to her~|~translationMissing
I'll go talk to her.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. The elder cadantine herb grew perfectly. Let's get it harvested.~|~translationMissing
Elena harvests the elder cadantine.~|~translationMissing
So what else do we need for the potion?~|~translationMissing
The other ingredient is crystal dust. Hopefully you can get some from Arianwyn or Baxtorian. Once you've got some dust, just add it to a vial of water along with the herb.~|~translationMissing
Right, I'll go see if I can get some crystal dust.~|~translationMissing
Don't forget this.~|~translationMissing
Elena tries to give you some elder cadantine but you don't have enough room for it.~|~translationMissing
Elena gives you some elder cadantine.~|~translationMissing
Hey Elena, what do I need to do again?~|~translationMissing
Add the elder cadantine to a vial of water and then add some crystal dust. Hopefully either Arianwyn or Baxtorian can give you some crystal dust.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hello. Do you need something?~|~translationMissing
I need some crystal dust for this potion I'm making.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes... I don't have anything you can use I'm afraid. Maybe Arianwyn can help you.~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name]. How's it going?~|~translationMissing
I'm working on getting that potion made. I need some crystal dust for it though.~|~translationMissing
Crystal dust? Interesting. Well I have an old crystal here that you can use. It will need grinding up though.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn tries to give you an old crystal but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn gives you an old crystal.~|~translationMissing
Why don't you try using that crystal I gave you?~|~translationMissing
Hey Elena, I've finished the potion.~|~translationMissing
Great, you should take it to Arianwyn and Baxtorian.~|~translationMissing
I've finished the potion.~|~translationMissing
Oh... You should give it to Arianwyn then.~|~translationMissing
I should probably take this to Arianwyn and Baxtorian rather than drinking it.~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll look after it for you. Now, let's call the others and discuss our plan for the Grand Library.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn calls the others to the meeting.~|~translationMissing
Right, thanks to [player name], we should now have everything we need to enter the crystal seed containing Prifddinas.~|~translationMissing
So we have a way to bypass the defences?~|~translationMissing
Indeed we do. Baxtorian's knowledge allowed [player name] to reunite us with Lord Amlodd and Lady Trahaearn. It was the Amlodd clan that created those defences, Lord Amlodd can overcome them for us.~|~translationMissing
My magic can be used to teleport someone through the defences and into the crystal. It will require great focus though, I will only be able to send one of you in.~|~translationMissing
The inversion potion will ensure that whoever is sent survives the journey, now we just need to decide who that is.~|~translationMissing
I propose we send [player name] in. They have proven to us time and time again that they have the skill needed for a challenge like this.~|~translationMissing
You cannot be serious? Even if [player name] has proven their worth as you claim, which I have my doubts about, they'll never be deemed worthy enough to unlock Seren's hidden knowledge.~|~translationMissing
Why? Because they're not an elf?~|~translationMissing
Exactly! If Seren created a way for the seals to be destroyed, she would have made it so that only an elf could break them.~|~translationMissing
Were you there when Seren made those seals, boy?~|~translationMissing
I... Well of course not.~|~translationMissing
Then how do you know what our goddess intended?~|~translationMissing
I just think...~|~translationMissing
I don't know this human here, but I damn well don't know you either. The human was capable enough to find me and fix my exoskeleton. Maybe they are capable of this as well.~|~translationMissing
Then I propose that [player name] be the one sent into the crystal. Anyone disagree?~|~translationMissing
Yes we already know you do Ysgawyn. Anyone else?~|~translationMissing
Right, [player name], talk to Lord Amlodd when you are ready. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
I... Hello. You should probably talk to Lord Amlodd.~|~translationMissing
Good luck in the library, [player name]. We're all counting on you. Speak to Lord Amlodd when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name] Good luck in the library. We'll talk more when you get back.~|~translationMissing
The Grand Library of Prifddinas, such a beautiful place. You will be the first to step foot there for hundreds of years.~|~translationMissing
What do I need to do once I arrive?~|~translationMissing
They say Lord Iorwerth broke one of the nine seals of Seren within the library. Find this seal, and see what knowledge he uncovered.~|~translationMissing
Once that is done, seek out the other eight seals, see if you can break them as well. Their knowledge may be key to our fight against the darkness.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea how to break the seals?~|~translationMissing
According to Baxtorian, Seren herself said that those who follow the light will be able to access her knowledge.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't give me a lot to go on.~|~translationMissing
No, but it is all you have. Now, when you are ready, I can teleport you into the crystal seed. I have the potion that you made earlier, it will ensure you survive the journey.~|~translationMissing
One last thing, the laws that this land abide by, they may not apply in the library.~|~translationMissing
The library has been reverted to crystal. That which is impossible out here, may well be normal in an environment like that. You should be cautious.~|~translationMissing
Now, are you ready?~|~translationMissing
You are about to enter the Grand Library of Prifddinas. Any items left in the library, including upon death, will be lost.~|~translationMissing
Enter the Grand Library?~|~translationMissing
Let me go and prepare first.~|~translationMissing
As you wish.~|~translationMissing
Do you wish to return to the Grand Library?~|~translationMissing
Seren~|~translationMissing
And so comes another, to seek the knowledge of Seren. Greetings mortal.~|~translationMissing
You... You're Seren?~|~translationMissing
Memory of Seren~|~translationMissing
No... I'm just a memory. A mere fragment of something far greater. A guardian of the knowledge that she left behind.~|~translationMissing
I seek that knowledge, to help in the fight against Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
It is not my place to question why. I only exist to pass on that which she sealed away.~|~translationMissing
So you'll give me the knowledge?~|~translationMissing
The seals guard the truth. This seal has been broken, its knowledge is now open to all. Here is what you seek~|~translationMissing
'...Therein lies my guilt. A part of me, trapped and alone. Dark, yes, but still a part of my being, sealed away in the Temple of Light.'~|~translationMissing
'The protections on the temple, they should keep her contained. But in case they don't, I created one last safeguard, a prison within a prison. With it I made a key, an orb of light, to unlock the darkness.'~|~translationMissing
'I could have destroyed it, sealed her away forever. But I still question my decision, and so I hid the orb away, while I think upon my choices.'~|~translationMissing
'The shrine at Gorlah, that is where it lies. With it, she can be freed... or destroyed...'~|~translationMissing
And so ends the knowledge of this seal.~|~translationMissing
So Lord Iorwerth spoke the truth. A part of Seren lives within the Temple of Light. But why?~|~translationMissing
I have imparted the knowledge of this seal. There is nothing more here to give. If you seek the rest, then the other seals must be broken.~|~translationMissing
Start with the Seal of Ithell, to the south east. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
The seeker of knowledge returns. Do you wish to hear the knowledge again?~|~translationMissing
Here is what you seek~|~translationMissing
If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Ithell. You'll find it on the middle level, to the south east. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
Then I have nothing more to give. If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Ithell. You'll find it on the middle level, to the south east. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
'When I first encountered the elves on their homeworld of Tarddiad, it was like I had finally found my purpose. I quickly fell in love with them, and they with me.'~|~translationMissing
'I set out to help them, to guide them. They immediately embraced this, and one of their mystics, Ceidwad, documented my teachings in a great book called the Cerddi.'~|~translationMissing
'It was the start of something beautiful, but there is pain in beauty, as I soon came to realise...'~|~translationMissing
If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Cadarn. You'll find it on the bottom level, to the south. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
You hear a strange sound coming from the central chamber.~|~translationMissing
If you wish, I can return you to the central chamber.~|~translationMissing
The player is teleported to the central chamber.~|~translationMissing
Could you teleport me somewhere?~|~translationMissing
Where would you like to go?~|~translationMissing
An interface opens, giving the player choices on which clan seal to teleport to. If the player chooses a seal they have not unlocked yet, the next dialogue is as follows~|~translationMissing
I can only take you to a seal which has already been broken.~|~translationMissing
Then I have nothing more to give. If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Cadarn. You'll find it on the bottom level, to the south. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
'...Compared to many of the mortal races I had encountered, the elves had reasonable lifespans. And yet, it wasn't long enough.'~|~translationMissing
'As I spent time with the elves, I watched as they withered and died. Each death was a blade through my heart, but none more so than Ceidwad, my closest companion.'~|~translationMissing
'It didn't seem fair, didn't seem right. They deserved more. I knew I had to give it to them...'~|~translationMissing
If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Crwys. You'll find it on the middle level, to the north west. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
Then I have nothing more to give. If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Crwys. You'll find it on the middle level, to the north west. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
'...I found a way to share my essence with the elves, a piece of my being for each one of them.'~|~translationMissing
'With this gift, their years would number in the thousands, time enough to live the lives they deserved.'~|~translationMissing
'In keeping with elven tradition, the gift was given through a song. They called it the song of creation, for it was the creation of a new life for them. At least, so we thought...'~|~translationMissing

'...With all my knowledge, I should have known not to meddle. That which I intended as a gift, soon turned out to be their curse.'~|~translationMissing
'The song of creation increased their lifespans, but at a terrible price. It bound them to me. To stray too far from their sides, caused pain, and even death.'~|~translationMissing
'I knew I had to help them, to fix my mistakes. I should have known that I'd only make it worse...'~|~translationMissing

'...Another being came to our world. Divine like myself, but not by design. He spoke of a perfect world, one filled with power.'~|~translationMissing
'I knew it was a risk, but I decided to travel there. The power he spoke of might have been the only thing capable of saving the elves.'~|~translationMissing
'The curse made it impossible for me to go without them, so they had to come with me, and leave their home behind. It was hard on them, but in the end, I managed to convince them...'~|~translationMissing

'...We made our home in the new world, in a great city of crystal spires. It was as beautiful as the world from which we came. But beneath that beauty, the curse remained.'~|~translationMissing
'The power that filled the world was even greater than I had anticipated. A higher power, one I had not encountered for a long time.'~|~translationMissing
'I was sure this world held the key to breaking the curse, I just needed to find it...'~|~translationMissing
If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Trahaearn. You'll find it on the top level, to the east. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing

'...It took millennia, but I finally made a breakthrough. Deep beneath the mountains near our home, I found a source of deathly energy.'~|~translationMissing
'I was sure I could use this power to save them. My essence is of life, of light. This darkness would be the perfect counter, a way to nullify the curse.'~|~translationMissing
'I should have known not to be so foolish. This curse started with my meddling, my meddling was never going to end it...'~|~translationMissing
If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Iorwerth. You'll find it on the middle level, to the north east. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
Then I have nothing more to give. If you seek more of the knowledge, look to the Seal of Iorwerth. You'll find it on the middle level, to the north east. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
'...I am a being of light, but even within me, there was some darkness. I poured this darkness into my creation, combining it with the deathly energy I had found.'~|~translationMissing
'When I was done, I looked upon my creation. A fragment of myself, but one of darkness, rather than light. I thought her essence would counter my own, ending the curse with her mere existence.'~|~translationMissing
'It was not to be though. The curse was tied to me, not to her. I had failed, and she knew it. She turned on me, tried to destroy me. I had to stop her, so I sealed her away, in the very place I had created her...'~|~translationMissing
So Seren split off a fragment of herself, hoping it would help fix her mistakes. That's what lives within the Temple of Light, that's what Lord Iorwerth is trying to summon.~|~translationMissing
I should return to Lletya and let the others know what I've discovered.~|~translationMissing
Can you take me somewhere else?~|~translationMissing
An interface opens, giving the player choices on which clan seal to teleport to.~|~translationMissing
Then I have nothing more to give. If you wish to hear a different piece of knowledge, look to the other seals. The light will guide the way...~|~translationMissing
Your work in the library, is it done?~|~translationMissing
Then you should speak with Arianwyn at once.~|~translationMissing
I... Hello.~|~translationMissing
I'm done with the library.~|~translationMissing
I see... You should tell Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
Hey [player name]. You'd better speak with Arianwyn if you're done in the library.~|~translationMissing
[player name], you have returned. Did you discover anything in the Grand Library?~|~translationMissing
I did. I think we should call the others.~|~translationMissing
I see. I will summon them at once.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thank you all for joining us. In case you weren't aware, [player name] here has returned from the Grand Library with some news for us.~|~translationMissing
I entered the library and found the seal broken by Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
So he did break one of the seals. Did it hide anything notable?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it contained a memory, left behind by Seren herself.~|~translationMissing
A memory of Seren? Amazing!~|~translationMissing
It was only part of something larger though. I had to break the other eight seals to uncover the rest of it.~|~translationMissing
So you managed to break all of Seren's seals? Very impressive [player name]. Now tell us, this memory, what was it?~|~translationMissing
That's where it gets interesting... The memory spoke of a curse on the elves, a curse that Seren was desperately trying to break.~|~translationMissing
A curse? What curse?~|~translationMissing
A curse binding the elves to Seren. As long as she remained close, it was unnoticeable, but if she went too far... pain, and death.~|~translationMissing
But who was responsible? Who cursed our people?~|~translationMissing
That's the thing... It was Seren herself.~|~translationMissing
Seren was our goddess, she would never curse us. How dare you suggest otherwise!~|~translationMissing
I'm telling the truth!~|~translationMissing
Truth? You don't know the meaning of the word!~|~translationMissing
Let them finish Ysgawyn!~|~translationMissing
She didn't mean to do it, she was trying to help. She was using her own essence to try and extend your lifespans, it just went wrong...~|~translationMissing
I... I don't believe it. She cursed us? Our goddess cursed us?~|~translationMissing
If... If what you say is true, how does it relate to Lord Iorwerth's claims?~|~translationMissing
Seren went to great lengths to undo the curse. She believed that she could nullify it by creating a being of darkness, one to counter her light essence.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth spoke the truth. She created a fragment of herself, filled with darkness, hoping to use it to break the curse. It didn't work though, so she sealed it in the Temple of Light.~|~translationMissing
This can't be real... This is a dream... Tell me this isn't real!~|~translationMissing
This is a lie! It has to be! The human is showing their true colours once again!~|~translationMissing
Boy, what did I tell you about insulting the human!~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn? What do we do?~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn?~|~translationMissing
Why are we still stood here? This human needs putting in chains!~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn? Do something!~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn!~|~translationMissing
I don't know what to do!~|~translationMissing
I don't know what to do...~|~translationMissing
You think I know something you all don't? You think I have some trick hidden up my sleeve? I have nothing!~|~translationMissing
You're our leader! Lead!~|~translationMissing
And how would you have me do that, Ysgawyn? How am I meant to respond to this?~|~translationMissing
You can start by locking this human up. They are a traitor! The curse is clearly a lie!~|~translationMissing
If we were truly tied to Seren, we'd have all dropped dead when she was shattered! The curse clearly doesn't exist!~|~translationMissing
Well... Don't be so sure of that.~|~translationMissing
Nice of you to suddenly speak up! I'd have thought a king would command a bit of authority rather than crying in the corner!~|~translationMissing
I'm not a king any more...~|~translationMissing
Well thank Seren for that! You only managed to lose the entire kingdom to Lord Iorwerth!~|~translationMissing
You should learn some respect!~|~translationMissing
I have respect! I respect the heroes who died in this war, not the coward that ran away from it!~|~translationMissing
You... You're right. I failed you, I failed you all. I wish I could go back and change that, but I can't. All I can do now, is try and make things right.~|~translationMissing
While horrifying, I believe [player name] speaks the truth. They have no reason to lie to us, and what they say does make sense.~|~translationMissing
Most of you never met Seren. You only know her through the stories passed down to you. But I did know her, and I know she was filled with pain.~|~translationMissing
You... You think this is the reason?~|~translationMissing
I think it could be. As for why we don't feel the effects of the curse now, that is because Seren is still with us, every one of us.~|~translationMissing
Of course, the crystal seeds. All of us carry them in some form or other, and all of them came from Seren when she shattered herself.~|~translationMissing
Her last attempt to break the curse, after everything else failed...~|~translationMissing
There's one other thing. Seren built a second set of defences within the Temple of Light, this fragment of her is sealed within them. There's an orb that can bypass these defences.~|~translationMissing
An orb?~|~translationMissing
Yes, apparently she hid it somewhere called Gorlah.~|~translationMissing
I know of Gorlah. It's an old shrine north of Prifddinas, a place for quiet worship away from the city.~|~translationMissing
Does Lord Iorwerth know about the orb?~|~translationMissing
Then he might already have claimed it. We should send someone to check.~|~translationMissing
I will go. I wish to see some actual proof of what this human claims.~|~translationMissing
That's not your call. Arianwyn is in charge here.~|~translationMissing
Am I? My whole life, I've been fighting Lord Iorwerth. My whole life, I've believed him to be a servant of Zamorak. Now I learn that everything I fought for was a lie.~|~translationMissing
I don't even know what I'm leading any more...~|~translationMissing
Maybe Lord Iorwerth fights for a different cause to what we thought, but that doesn't change who he is, that doesn't change what he's done.~|~translationMissing
I need time alone... Time to think... Baxtorian, I would appreciate it if you could take charge for a while.~|~translationMissing
Oh... I... I'll do my best.~|~translationMissing
That's all I ask. Now, I would like to be alone.~|~translationMissing
You're not the only one. I think we all need time to process this.~|~translationMissing
Then let us close this meeting. We will reconvene later.~|~translationMissing
So what do we do now?~|~translationMissing
There's a lot to think about, for all of us. There's also a lot we still don't know.~|~translationMissing
Do you think Arianwyn will be okay?~|~translationMissing
I hope so... I know the pain he feels, it can tear you apart if you're not careful.~|~translationMissing
You seem to be dealing with it okay.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad it seems that way, that's not how it feels though. I knew of Seren's troubles, but to know the cause... it's heart-breaking.~|~translationMissing
Now I find myself leading once more, something I swore I would never do again.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn seems to think you're capable.~|~translationMissing
Yes... But Arianwyn doesn't know me, not really.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I suppose my job now is to make sure we don't lose sight of our goal.~|~translationMissing
Do we know what that is anymore?~|~translationMissing
To stop Lord Iorwerth. Even if we now know his true intentions, even if some think those intentions may be good, we can't ignore his actions.~|~translationMissing
He'd see us all dead just to free this fragment of Seren. He has to be stopped.~|~translationMissing
What do you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn has gone to see if he can find the orb you spoke of. No one actually gave him permission, but he seems to care little for orders at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Once he gets back we'll know more about what to do next. In the meantime, I've managed to decipher the clues left behind by Lord Crwys and Lady Hefin, two more of the clan elders. We should try to find them.~|~translationMissing
How do I find Lord Crwys?~|~translationMissing
'The trees of my home will call to me.'~|~translationMissing
The Crwys clan is a clan of woodcutters and farmers. The entire clan is close to nature, but none more than Lord Crwys.~|~translationMissing
How do I find Lady Hefin?~|~translationMissing
'I will walk across the water to the south.'~|~translationMissing
The Hefin clan are our religious leaders. They teach us to better ourselves, not just in mind, but in body as well. Lady Hefin used to lead some of the more vigorous training exercises of the Hefin clan.~|~translationMissing
You should try and find Lord Crwys and Lady Hefin. They could be of big help to us in the fight against Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
Lord Piquan Crwys~|~translationMissing
Ahh... Stop, stop stop!~|~translationMissing
Oh... You're not a tree.~|~translationMissing
A tree? No of course not! I am an elf, but through deep magic, I took on the form of a tree. It allowed me to hide, to stay safe.~|~translationMissing
Safe from Lord Iorwerth?~|~translationMissing
You know of Lord Iorwerth?~|~translationMissing
Yes. You must be Lord Crwys, Baxtorian sent me to find you. We need your help.~|~translationMissing
I see. Where is Baxtorian?~|~translationMissing
The village of Lletya. It's east of here.~|~translationMissing
Then it is time for me to uproot. I will head there at once.~|~translationMissing
Lord Crwys departs for Lletya.~|~translationMissing
It's strange to be an elf again. I spent so long living as a tree I almost forgot what my true form felt like.~|~translationMissing
Maybe the tree was your true form and this is just your disguise.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Now there's an interesting thought...~|~translationMissing
Elf Hermit~|~translationMissing
A traveller? It's been a long time since I've had any company on this little island of mine.~|~translationMissing
I fear you are at a dead end though, there's nothing of interest for you here.~|~translationMissing
Don't be so sure. I got here by following a clue, a clue left behind by Lady Hefin. I seek her on behalf of Baxtorian himself.~|~translationMissing
Lady Carys Hefin~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian? I see. Then I have good news for you human, you have found the one you seek.~|~translationMissing
So you're Lady Hefin?~|~translationMissing
I am. I have lived here in solitude for a long time, but now that solitude must end. Where am I needed?~|~translationMissing
The village of Lletya, north of here.~|~translationMissing
Then it is time to resume my role among the elves. I will go at once.~|~translationMissing
Lady Hefin departs for Lletya.~|~translationMissing
The road to enlightenment is a perilous one. The latest peril is the largest I've ever seen though.~|~translationMissing
Do you think we can overcome it.~|~translationMissing
That is not for me to say. All I can do is see where this path takes me. And if this is the final step of my journey, then I go to my end willingly.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hello. Good work finding Lord Crwys and Lady Hefin. I never thought I'd see the other elders again, maybe we'll have a chance with them alongside us.~|~translationMissing
No problem. Any news from Ysgawyn?~|~translationMissing
He has just returned. Let us gather the others and hear what he has to say.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian calls the others to the meeting.~|~translationMissing
Now that Ysgawyn has returned, I thought we should gather to hear what he has discovered.~|~translationMissing
Where is Arianwyn?~|~translationMissing
I saw him heading out into the forest earlier. He must have wanted some time alone.~|~translationMissing
I hope he's okay.~|~translationMissing
He'll be alright, just give him time. While he is gone, we need to keep making progress.~|~translationMissing
On that note, what news do you have, Ysgawyn?~|~translationMissing
The shrine at Gorlah was empty. The orb was removed quite a while ago by the looks of things.~|~translationMissing
So do you believe me now?~|~translationMissing
If it helps with your overinflated ego, then yes, I now believe you.~|~translationMissing
If the orb isn't at Gorlah, Lord Iorwerth must have claimed it. It could be anywhere now.~|~translationMissing
Well luckily for us, I know exactly where it is. There's a cave just north of the Iorwerth Camp that is used to store supplies. Lord Iorwerth has it under close guard there.~|~translationMissing
Because I went scouting.~|~translationMissing
Scouting? At the Iorwerth Camp? Who gave you permission?~|~translationMissing
I gave myself permission. I do not serve you, Baxtorian, or anyone else here.~|~translationMissing
No, you just serve yourself, don't you Ysgawyn?~|~translationMissing
My actions benefit us all! Now that we know where the orb is, we can move to claim it.~|~translationMissing
But why would Lord Iorwerth keep the orb at the camp? Surely it would be more secure behind the Prifddinas walls.~|~translationMissing
That's the other thing I found out. Lord Iorwerth knows we managed to enter the library. He fears the orb would not be safe behind the walls.~|~translationMissing
How did you discover this?~|~translationMissing
I have my methods...~|~translationMissing
It worries me that you are unwilling to share them.~|~translationMissing
Save your suspicions for someone who cares.~|~translationMissing
So we know where the orb is. What do we do now?~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth intends to use the orb to free the dark fragment of Seren. We need to stop him.~|~translationMissing
But this fragment of Seren, it's still part of her. Lord Iorwerth has done some unspeakable things, but he doesn't serve Zamorak like we thought, maybe we can reason with him.~|~translationMissing
I tried to reason with Lord Iorwerth a long time ago... It won't work, as much as I wish it would.~|~translationMissing
Regardless of his intentions, Lord Iorwerth is our enemy. You should want to kill him, not reason with him.~|~translationMissing
I would never wish for the death of a fellow elf, no matter what they've done.~|~translationMissing
Well look at you with your moral high ground.~|~translationMissing
Now is not the time for arguing. At some point, we will need to decide what to do about the fragment of Seren. For now though, we need to focus on getting that orb and stopping Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
The orb isn't enough for him to win though, he'll also need to break through the defences on the Temple of Light. He'll struggle to do that now he's lost Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
There is another way into the temple though, a tunnel from the Underground Pass, built by the dwarves there.~|~translationMissing
Great... Dwarves... I hate dwarves.~|~translationMissing
You hate everything Ysgawyn.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth will stop at nothing to enter the temple. We have to assume that sooner or later, he will find that tunnel.~|~translationMissing
Then we should make sure the tunnel is secure. Baxtorian, allow myself and the other elders to go meet with these dwarves.~|~translationMissing
Very well, head to the Underground Pass and see what you can do. In the meantime, we should secure that orb. Even if he does get into the temple, Lord Iorwerth can do nothing without it.~|~translationMissing
Let me guess, you're going to send your favourite human.~|~translationMissing
Jealous, Ysgawyn?~|~translationMissing
No. I have other things to do anyway.~|~translationMissing
[player name], head to the cave at the Iorwerth Camp and recover the Orb of Light. Be careful though, it's likely to be well guarded.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like we're done here. Let's get moving.~|~translationMissing
Head to the cave at the Iorwerth Camp and recover the Orb of Light. Be careful though, it's likely to be well guarded.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you want to enter the cave? Any items left inside, including upon death, will be lost.~|~translationMissing
Iorwerth Warrior~|~translationMissing
Iorwerth Archer~|~translationMissing
Well prepare to die [Tim/Sue]!~|~translationMissing
You search the chest and find an orb.~|~translationMissing
I've managed to recover the orb.~|~translationMissing
Thank you friend. Without this, Lord Iorwerth has no hope of freeing that fragment of Seren. I will look after it until we decide what to do with it.~|~translationMissing
We have the orb, and the elders are securing the Temple of Light as we speak. That fragment of Seren should no longer be a concern.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth is still out there and thanks to his larger army, we have no way of easily dealing with him.~|~translationMissing
There must be something we can do.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure there is, but I don't know what.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps we should call the others then.~|~translationMissing
I was thinking the same. However, I have a favour to ask first. Something I'd rather keep quiet.~|~translationMissing
Our group is fractured. The revelation about Seren has hit everyone hard, and opinions clearly differ on how we should be responding to it. I fear some intend to take matters into their own hands.~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn in particular has been very distant. I have concerns about his loyalties.~|~translationMissing
You don't think he'd join with Lord Iorwerth do you?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. He claims to hate the Iorwerth clan, and he has more reason to feel that way than most. That said... something isn't right.~|~translationMissing
And you want me to investigate?~|~translationMissing
I do. Ysgawyn left the village after the meeting earlier. See if you can track him down and find out what he's up to.~|~translationMissing
Any idea where he might have gone?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. Elena said she saw him leaving though, maybe she can help.~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn has been acting suspiciously. See if you can find him and work out what he's up to. Elena said she saw him leaving the village. She might know where he went.~|~translationMissing
Hey Elena, how's it going?~|~translationMissing
Not too bad. I've been given a lot to think about though. Everything I've learnt about Seren, about the elves... it's crazy how big it all is. Our little fight in Ardougne seems so small now.~|~translationMissing
I'm surprised it hasn't made you run for the hills.~|~translationMissing
Now you know me better than that, I'm too stubborn to leave now.~|~translationMissing
Why are you still here though?~|~translationMissing
It's about closure I guess. So many people were hurt by Lord Iorwerth's actions in West Ardougne. I need to know that he'll never hurt them again.~|~translationMissing
He seems to think his actions are necessary.~|~translationMissing
Maybe his cause is just, but that doesn't give him the right to ruin lives in the way he has.~|~translationMissing
What do you think should happen to him if we win?~|~translationMissing
You mean do I think he should die?~|~translationMissing
I've tried to dedicate my life to helping people, healing them. I think all lives are valuable, even the lives of people like Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
I think Lord Iorwerth should face justice for what he has done. I don't think killing him is justice though. Maybe that makes me weak, but that's how I feel.~|~translationMissing
I don't think it makes you weak, it makes you strong.~|~translationMissing
You do? Thank you, that means a lot, especially from you.~|~translationMissing
I realise I must come across as so self-righteous with all of this. I'm sorry about that.~|~translationMissing
As much as I hate it, I know that sometimes death is the only option. I like to think we can consider alternatives though. It's what sets us apart from the enemy.~|~translationMissing
He needs to pay for what he's done though.~|~translationMissing
He does, but does it need to be with his life? Killing is a solution, but maybe it's not the only one.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry. I realise I must come across as so self- righteous talking like this. I'm not trying to act better than anyone, I just want to make sure we've considered every option.~|~translationMissing
Sometimes people have to die for things to change.~|~translationMissing
I suppose... I just can't help but wonder if there might be another way.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, did you want something?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I wanted to ask you about Ysgawyn.~|~translationMissing
That's fair. Anyway, I wanted to ask you about Ysgawyn.~|~translationMissing
Very true. Anyway, I'll see you later.~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'm trying to find him. Baxtorian said you saw him leaving the village earlier.~|~translationMissing
I did. I don't know where he went though.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. That's annoying.~|~translationMissing
He only left recently, maybe you can pick up his trail. Have a look around the hidden entrance to the village, by the wolves, and see if you can find anything out of place.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. Thanks Elena.~|~translationMissing
Hi there. I'm sure you've got things to do. You should probably go do them.~|~translationMissing
Well well! Meeting with the Iorwerth clan, Ysgawyn? This doesn't look good for you!~|~translationMissing
You! What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Keeping an eye on you, you traitor!~|~translationMissing
Traitor? You dare call me a traitor? Your loyalties change more than the wind and you have the nerve to say I'm the traitor?~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth took everything from me! My whole life was destroyed by him and that dog, Essyllt! Do you really think I'd join up with them?~|~translationMissing
Well that's what it looks like!~|~translationMissing
You fool of a human! I may not agree much with the other rebels but everything I've done has been to stop Lord Iorwerth!~|~translationMissing
Well who's this then?~|~translationMissing
Well now that you've ruined everything as usual, I suppose I'd better tell you.~|~translationMissing
This is Iestin Edern, head of research for Lord Iorwerth, and my informant within the Iorwerth clan.~|~translationMissing
Wait... Your informant?~|~translationMissing
That's right you idiot! Iestin here has been providing me with information on the Iorwerth clan. Not only that, he is the reason why you were able to claim that Orb of Light.~|~translationMissing
But... I don't understand. If you've always been loyal, why all the secrecy?~|~translationMissing
Iestin~|~translationMissing
That was my request. I feared that the other rebels may not be trusting of me. They could have imprisoned me or even killed me. It seemed safer to keep things secret.~|~translationMissing
Not to mention the fact that it kept Iestin safe from any informants that Lord Iorwerth might have among the rebels.~|~translationMissing
I... I see... I guess that all makes sense.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry Ysgawyn.~|~translationMissing
I don't want an apology! I don't care how you feel about me. All I care about is stopping Lord Iorwerth for good. I lost all that I had, all that I cared about! I will make him pay!~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn told me what they did. I...~|~translationMissing
No! You don't get to talk about that! You have no right!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry...~|~translationMissing
Sorry to interrupt, but I think you need to hear this.~|~translationMissing
Yes. What news do you bring Iestin?~|~translationMissing
So what have you been discussing?~|~translationMissing
Before you interrupted, Iestin was about to give me some news. Go ahead Iestin.~|~translationMissing
It's not good I'm afraid. The human here was not wrong to suspect a betrayal. Lord Iorwerth, he knows about Lletya.~|~translationMissing
By Seren! How?~|~translationMissing
There is a traitor amongst your people. I know not who they are, but it wasn't this human as you feared. They told Lord Iorwerth how to find the village.~|~translationMissing
When did he find out?~|~translationMissing
Earlier today. Essyllt is preparing their forces as we speak.~|~translationMissing
Essyllt!~|~translationMissing
Hang on... If the traitor was one of the rebels, they'll also have told Lord Iorwerth about the tunnel into the Temple of Light!~|~translationMissing
He'll know how to get in... He just needs to reclaim the orb! We need to get to Lletya now!~|~translationMissing
Your days as an informant are done. You're coming with us. Now we need to move!~|~translationMissing
You return to Lletya.~|~translationMissing
Elena! Are you okay?~|~translationMissing
I'm fine. We need to get the citizens to safety!~|~translationMissing
Where's Baxtorian? Where's the orb?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I don't know.~|~translationMissing
Dammit! Right, you two go with Elena and help the citizens. I'll find Baxtorian.~|~translationMissing
But nothing! Now go!~|~translationMissing
Mawrth~|~translationMissing
My children! Someone help me find my children!~|~translationMissing
[player name], you go help Mawrth. We'll get the other citizens to safety.~|~translationMissing
My children are hiding in there! Please find them! Please save them!~|~translationMissing
Iona~|~translationMissing
I... I'm scared...~|~translationMissing
You have to be brave. Your mother is outside waiting for you.~|~translationMissing
Okay... I can be brave!~|~translationMissing
Eoin~|~translationMissing
What's happening? Where's mummy?~|~translationMissing
She's outside, can you get to her?~|~translationMissing
I... I think so...~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, you can do this!~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth!~|~translationMissing
Go! I'll get Mawrth and the other citizens to safety!~|~translationMissing
Well well, the great King Baxtorian. I wasn't sure I believed it when I heard you were still alive, but here you are.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to disappoint you.~|~translationMissing
Well your ability to disappoint is one of your few talents, so I'll let it slide. However, I must insist that you give me the orb.~|~translationMissing
Crawl back into the hole you came from Lord Iorwerth, you won't leave here with that orb!~|~translationMissing
Oh I will, one way or another. But in case it wasn't clear, let me explain the situation.~|~translationMissing
As we speak, my forces are dealing with the last of your rebels and rounding up your citizens. You have no way to fight, and nowhere to run.~|~translationMissing
Of course, I could just have you all killed right now. After the trouble you've all caused me, it wouldn't be an unreasonable act. However, I am not without mercy, and I will not draw blood unless I have to.~|~translationMissing
Instead, I give you a choice. Give me the orb, and I will withdraw my forces, leaving you in peace. Refuse, and the blood of those citizens will be on your hands.~|~translationMissing
We do not barter with your kind!~|~translationMissing
I feared as much. That said, I do have someone here who might change your mind.~|~translationMissing
What is this? What have you done?~|~translationMissing
What have I done? Well I told him the truth. It was about time that someone did.~|~translationMissing
What truth?~|~translationMissing
They're not the enemy. I thought they were, for so long, but they're not.~|~translationMissing
Everything we have done, every sacrifice we have made, all of it has been to free our goddess.~|~translationMissing
You've never sacrificed, you've never lost anything. You only sacrifice those around you...~|~translationMissing
You have some nerve to lecture me. Remind me, how many of your people died under your watch? How many fell, trying to free your wife?~|~translationMissing
These new followers of yours, do they know? Do they know what you did? Do they know about the monster you truly are?~|~translationMissing
I never...~|~translationMissing
No... of course they don't. You're a liar and a coward, that's all you've ever been.~|~translationMissing
As for me, I'm many things, and I admit, a lot of them aren't good. But I would never throw lives away like you did.~|~translationMissing
What's he on about?~|~translationMissing
Nothing... He's lying. He's just trying to justify his mistakes.~|~translationMissing
I've done many terrible things, but none of them were a mistake. Every sacrifice I've made has been for her, for Seren.~|~translationMissing
And what are these apparent sacrifices you've made? Nothing compared to the suffering you've caused me, I'm sure!~|~translationMissing
When I first discovered the truth, our clan was still ruled by my mother. I went to her, told her what I'd found, told her what we needed to do.~|~translationMissing
I loved my mother, but she was blindly loyal to this fool here, she wouldn't have any of it. I couldn't just abandon my goddess though, she needed us. So I did what had to be done.~|~translationMissing
You killed her?~|~translationMissing
And I would do it again without hesitation. For Seren, there is no price too great.~|~translationMissing
You're a monster! Surely you don't mean to side with this barbarian, Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
I don't condone what he did, what any of them have done. But they want what we want, we have to try working together.~|~translationMissing
I'll die before working with them.~|~translationMissing
No one else needs to die here. Please, just give me the orb. Do that, and I swear we will do you no further harm.~|~translationMissing
I... I can't.~|~translationMissing
I see. I did hope it wouldn't come to this, but you've given me no choice. Morvran.~|~translationMissing
Morvran leaves, bringing Eoin in.~|~translationMissing
What's going on? Where's mummy?~|~translationMissing
I'll make this simple for you, Baxtorian. The life of the boy is now in your hands. Give me the orb, and no harm will come to him.~|~translationMissing
You wouldn't...~|~translationMissing
No, I wouldn't. But the choice is not mine, it's yours. I will count to five.~|~translationMissing
One.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth, please...~|~translationMissing
Two.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian, please. Just give him the orb.~|~translationMissing
Three.~|~translationMissing
I don't like this, I want mummy!~|~translationMissing
Four.~|~translationMissing
I'll give you the orb. Just please, don't hurt anyone else.~|~translationMissing
A wise choice, must be a first for you.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian gives Lord Iorwerth the orb.~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn attempts to stop them, but Essylt kills him in one hit.~|~translationMissing
Ysgawyn!~|~translationMissing
Get after them!~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn...~|~translationMissing
It wasn't meant to go like this. No one was meant to get hurt. I'm sorry.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand... why?~|~translationMissing
For so long I was led to believe that Lord Iorwerth was our enemy. I thought he'd turned his back on Seren, thought he'd betrayed her.~|~translationMissing
But I was wrong. Everything we thought we were fighting for was a lie. He never betrayed her, everything he did was to free her.~|~translationMissing
Whatever it is he's trying to free... it isn't her.~|~translationMissing
How do you know? Because of what you found in the library? How do we know that was her? How do we know what's true anymore?~|~translationMissing
So that's why you turned to Lord Iorwerth? To find out the truth?~|~translationMissing
My whole life I've dreamed of her, dreamed of what it would be like to meet her. If there's even a chance that she's still alive, I have to know.~|~translationMissing
And if she is alive? Then what?~|~translationMissing
Seren guided the elves for thousands of years. With her back, we'll finally be able to reform Prifddinas. We'll finally have peace again.~|~translationMissing
Peace? Look around you Arianwyn. Look at what Lord Iorwerth has done to this village, your home. Does this look like the work of someone who wants peace?~|~translationMissing
It doesn't have to be this way. Step aside. Let me stop Lord Iorwerth and reclaim the orb. Once he's dealt with, we can find out the truth, our way.~|~translationMissing
You... you know I can't do that.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn please...~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry friend, but I've made my choice. Now please, walk away. No one else needs to die here.~|~translationMissing
I can't let him get away.~|~translationMissing
And I can't let you go after him.~|~translationMissing
So be it.~|~translationMissing
He wasn't a friend, to any of us. Everything he cared about he lost a long time ago.~|~translationMissing
But he didn't give up. To the very end, he fought for a cause he believed in, our cause.~|~translationMissing
And now he's gone. Along with the orb and that traitor, Arianwyn. Lord Iorwerth has everything he needs now. He'll be preparing to move on the temple as we speak.~|~translationMissing
We can't give up Islwyn. If we do, then he died for nothing.~|~translationMissing
Oh I don't intend to give up, but make no mistake, this is a fight we're unlikely to win.~|~translationMissing
So what do we do? Baxtorian?~|~translationMissing
I... I don't think there's anything we can do. Lord Iorwerth will destroy us if we try to stop him.~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but we have to try. What else is there?~|~translationMissing
We'd be throwing lives away...~|~translationMissing
Well Lord Iorwerth seemed to think you were no stranger to that. Why did he think that?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, probably just some lie he tells himself.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I don't believe you.~|~translationMissing
You'd trust Lord Iorwerth over me?~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't trust Lord Iorwerth if my life depended on it. I know a liar when I see one though, and I can tell you're not being honest about something.~|~translationMissing
What happened? Tell us.~|~translationMissing
It was after we were defeated by Lord Iorwerth. With Prifddinas lost to us, we returned to our kingdom in the east. We'd been gone for years by then, and in our absence, the kingdom had fallen to our other foes.~|~translationMissing
So many dead... my people, the ones I was meant to protect. But that wasn't the worst of it. Glarial, my beloved, she was taken from me.~|~translationMissing
We searched far and wide, desperate to find her. At times it felt like we were close, but the enemy always managed to elude us.~|~translationMissing
Eventually, we managed to track her captors to some caves south of our ruined kingdom. It was clearly a trap, but I was a fool. I was so blind in my desire to find her, I didn't consider the obvious.~|~translationMissing
I sent my soldiers in, the few that I still had. They fought the best they could, but it was hopeless. They were massacred.~|~translationMissing
After that, I knew I couldn't carry on. I was alone and powerless. So I sealed myself away, in the hope that one day she would come back to me.~|~translationMissing
You... you killed them? You killed them all?~|~translationMissing
I did. But you don't understand, I loved my wife. If there was a chance of freeing her, I had to take it.~|~translationMissing
You think I don't understand love? I knew love, for Eirlys! My mother! Your daughter! She died in your war, while you hid away!~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth was right! You're just a coward!~|~translationMissing
Islwyn, where are you going?~|~translationMissing
The Underground Pass! I intend to fight for my people, even if their own king won't!~|~translationMissing
Islwyn leaves, and the funeral ends.~|~translationMissing
I used to think I was a good king, one that took care of his people. Thanks to me, they had roofs over their heads and food for their tables.~|~translationMissing
And yet... I never loved them, not really. The only thing I loved was her, my Glarial.~|~translationMissing
When they took her from me... I was torn apart. I vowed I would get her back no matter the cost. That vow destroyed my people... I destroyed my people. In the end... I became just like Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you did fail your people, you didn't destroy them though.~|~translationMissing
Maybe not then... but now...~|~translationMissing
You think this is over? Is that it? Lord Iorwerth beats us once so we just give up? If you truly think that then yes, you have destroyed your people!~|~translationMissing
Do you want to just rot here? Wallowing in your own self pity while you lose the little you still have?~|~translationMissing
What other option is there?~|~translationMissing
We can fight! Lord Iorwerth doesn't win until he gets into the Temple of Light! We can still stop this!~|~translationMissing
But he outnumbers us ten to one... We'll all die.~|~translationMissing
Surely it's better to die trying than to live a life of regret? I'd have thought you'd know that better than anyone.~|~translationMissing
Oh for crying out loud! You have got to be the biggest waste of space I have ever met! I've met goblins with more of a spine than you! For once in your miserable life why don't you actually do something worthwhile?~|~translationMissing
You... You're awful at pep talks.~|~translationMissing
It wasn't meant to be a pep talk!~|~translationMissing
*sigh* Look... Ask yourself this... What would she want?~|~translationMissing
She... She'd want me to save them.~|~translationMissing
Then why are we still stood around talking? We've got work to do!~|~translationMissing
I... You're right... We don't have a plan though.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth only has one way into the Temple of Light, the dwarf tunnel from the Underground Pass. We need to stop him getting through.~|~translationMissing
The dwarves should be able to seal the tunnel. We'll need to defend them while they do.~|~translationMissing
But we don't have the strength to withstand Lord Iorwerth's forces.~|~translationMissing
We have the clan elders, their combined power is an army in itself.~|~translationMissing
Not all the clan elders. We're still missing two.~|~translationMissing
Well have you deciphered their clues?~|~translationMissing
I have, but there's a problem. We should hopefully be able to find Lady Meilyr. But Lady Ithell, she died in the early days of the war.~|~translationMissing
That's not good. Did she have any descendants?~|~translationMissing
I had a look. Kelyn Ithell is her closest living relative. Problem is, we don't just need a Lady Ithell, we need the Lady Ithell.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. How did she die?~|~translationMissing
An illness of some sort, I never actually knew what it was. She'd had it for years.~|~translationMissing
For years? So she'd have been ill when she gave you her clue. If she knew she was dying, maybe her clue reflects that.~|~translationMissing
Knowledge can be passed on. Maybe the clue will lead us to her knowledge.~|~translationMissing
I... I suppose you could be right.~|~translationMissing
It's worth a shot at least. Leave it with me and I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, you should take the others to the dwarf camp in the Underground Pass.~|~translationMissing
See if you can get in contact with General Hining and the new king of Ardougne as well. Maybe they'll be willing to help us.~|~translationMissing
I'll see what I can do. We'll need to work quickly though, Lord Iorwerth will be preparing his forces as we speak. Now I guess you'll be wanting to hear those clues?~|~translationMissing
What's Lady Ithell's clue?~|~translationMissing
'I'll put my soul into my greatest work.'~|~translationMissing
The Ithell clan is a clan of builders and architects. Before her death, Lady Ithell was considered the finest architect of all the elves. This village was her final and finest contribution to our people.~|~translationMissing
What's Lady Meilyr's clue?~|~translationMissing
'Follow the scrolls to find me.'~|~translationMissing
The Meilyr clan is a clan of scientists and explorers. You'll probably need to do some exploring yourself to find Lady Meilyr. You may also find this of use.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian tries to give you a scroll but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian has given you a scroll.~|~translationMissing
Do you need to hear one of the clues again?~|~translationMissing
Still here, Iestin?~|~translationMissing
Well I can't really go back to Lord Iorwerth now. He knows I betrayed him.~|~translationMissing
No, but you don't have to stay here.~|~translationMissing
I've made my decision and I intend to stick by it.~|~translationMissing
So why follow him in the first place?~|~translationMissing
After we lost Seren, Baxtorian was chosen to lead us. Rather than looking after the city of Prifddinas, he chose to expand to the east, leaving us behind.~|~translationMissing
With no ruler, Prifddinas fell into chaos. When Lord Iorwerth came to us and said he'd found a way to bring Seren back to us, you can understand why we turned to him.~|~translationMissing
I wish things were as simple as good against evil, but that's rarely the case.~|~translationMissing
I suppose you're right. Anyway, I'd better get going.~|~translationMissing
Hey Elena. What are you up to?~|~translationMissing
Making sure I've got everything ready. I'll be leaving for the Underground Pass soon.~|~translationMissing
Well I've stuck around for this long, it would feel wrong to leave now. Besides, I may not be much of a fighter, but I can help in other ways.~|~translationMissing
Very true. I'll leave you to prepare.~|~translationMissing
You feel your mind fill with knowledge as the symbol vanishes before you. The knowledge is incomplete though.~|~translationMissing
The symbol vanishes before you as you gain the final piece of knowledge. The combined knowledge is a design for a statue to be built in the middle of Lletya, requiring 8 Limestone Bricks.~|~translationMissing
Lady Kelyn Ithell~|~translationMissing
Oh wow!~|~translationMissing
I... I see it! I see everything! All of her knowledge, I have it now!~|~translationMissing
Lady Ithell's knowledge?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I know everything that she knew! The statue, it must have given it to me somehow!~|~translationMissing
You're the closest living relative of Lady Ithell. Now you have her knowledge as well. I suppose that makes you the new Lady Ithell.~|~translationMissing
I... I suppose it does. Wow!~|~translationMissing
I guess you'll be wanting me to help defend the Underground Pass then? Well don't worry, I was planning on joining you anyway. With this new knowledge, I can be an even bigger help.~|~translationMissing
I'll head there right away. Time is of the essence.~|~translationMissing
Lady Ithell departs for the Underground Pass.~|~translationMissing
Lady Ffion Meilyr~|~translationMissing
At last Baxtorian calls to me. I can't say I expected him to send a human, but I suppose nothing is as expected these days.~|~translationMissing
We need your help. The final fight against Lord Iorwerth is nearly here.~|~translationMissing
I will join you in this darkest of hours. Where must I go?~|~translationMissing
The battle will take place in the Underground Pass. Head to Lletya first though, Baxtorian will meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Lady Meilyr departs for Lletya.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Hello. Most of the others have departed for the Underground Pass. I'll be leaving with the rest soon.~|~translationMissing
Then I shall meet you there.~|~translationMissing
Don't take too long. We'll be at the dwarf camp.~|~translationMissing
How are you Islwyn?~|~translationMissing
As good as can be, all things considered. I idolised my grandfather for years. They always say you should never meet your heroes though, now I see why.~|~translationMissing
He's still your family though.~|~translationMissing
He is, he's the only family I have left. The rest of them died in his war. A war that will finally end today.~|~translationMissing
Maybe if we both survive, I'll find it in my heart to forgive him. But for now, I have to focus elsewhere.~|~translationMissing
I'll leave you to prepare.~|~translationMissing
Good luck [player name]. I'll see you on the other side.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Could I buy some crystal equipment?~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn is out there, walking alongside our greatest enemy.~|~translationMissing
He saved me once you know. Some of Lord Iorwerth's men found me in the forest. There were too many for me to fight off, I thought I was done for. Without Arianwyn, I wouldn't be here today.~|~translationMissing
But now he fights alongside them. This war has torn us apart, all of us.~|~translationMissing
Well it ends today.~|~translationMissing
Yes, today it ends... For better, or for worse.~|~translationMissing
I wonder if Essyllt will join the battle today.~|~translationMissing
What will you do if he does?~|~translationMissing
Me? Nothing. I'm not much of a fighter. I'll be helping with the wounded instead.~|~translationMissing
You though... If you see him, don't show him mercy, for he will show you none. Instead, you should show him what happens to those who hurt us.~|~translationMissing
For Ysgawyn?~|~translationMissing
No one liked him that much, but he was one of us, and he died trying to save us. He deserves justice.~|~translationMissing
If I get the chance, I'll make sure he gets it.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Could you enchant something for me?~|~translationMissing
Those are my people coming for us. My brothers and sisters.~|~translationMissing
They were once, but not anymore. You're one of us now.~|~translationMissing
He's not evil you know, Lord Iorwerth. None of them are really, apart from Essyllt maybe.~|~translationMissing
Those that follow him, they do so because they believe in him, believe in what he's doing. For a long time, I believed in him as well.~|~translationMissing
So why did you betray him?~|~translationMissing
He became so obsessed with his cause, he forgot why we started following him in the first place. He became more extreme, more radical.~|~translationMissing
I tried to advise him as best I could, but over time he started listening more to Essyllt and less to me.~|~translationMissing
After I lost my brother, who died following Lord Iorwerth's orders, I realised he needed to be stopped before it was too late.~|~translationMissing
You made the right choice.~|~translationMissing
I hope so. But even now I find myself filled with doubt.~|~translationMissing
Kamen~|~translationMissing
Nothing like a *hic* bit of home brew before getting to work.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you should be drinking? We can't afford to make mistakes here.~|~translationMissing
Argh, I work better with a bit of *hic* brew in me. Nothing for you to *hic* worry about.~|~translationMissing
Klank~|~translationMissing
Didn't think I'd see you back down here [player name]. The elves are lucky to have you on their side.~|~translationMissing
They're lucky to have you as well, you're our last hope.~|~translationMissing
What an awful thought. Four dwarves, one a drunk, are the final hope against this darkness. I hope we don't let you down.~|~translationMissing
You won't.~|~translationMissing
I hope you're right friend.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you anymore gauntlets?~|~translationMissing
Take care Klank.~|~translationMissing
You too adventurer...~|~translationMissing
Niloof~|~translationMissing
[player name]. We'll soon be ready to seal the tunnel, it's slow work I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
If we do this wrong, we'll bring the entire cavern down upon all of us.~|~translationMissing
Well that would definitely stop Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
It would. I don't know about you though, but I intend to survive this day. Bringing the cavern down isn't a good way to achieve that.~|~translationMissing
True that. I'll leave you to your work.~|~translationMissing
Thorgel~|~translationMissing
Hey there [player name].~|~translationMissing
How's it going Thorgel?~|~translationMissing
Apart from the army of elves about to descend on us, pretty good.~|~translationMissing
You'll be fine, you've got all of us to defend you.~|~translationMissing
Well let's hope your better at fighting than Kamen is at brewing, or this will be a short battle.~|~translationMissing
So here we are. At long last, the end is upon us. The only question that remains is who it's the end for.~|~translationMissing
You knew this day would come?~|~translationMissing
No war lasts forever, not even this one. The darkest verse of the song of the elves is upon us. Who knows what the next verse will be.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth better show up soon! I can't wait forever!~|~translationMissing
You seem keen.~|~translationMissing
I've lived for thousands of years. If I'm going to die today, I'd rather just get on with it.~|~translationMissing
This is a dark place we've come to. Fitting I suppose, for this is to be our darkest hour.~|~translationMissing
Do you think the fragment of Seren is the cause of the darkness?~|~translationMissing
Possibly, I suspect it was here long before her though. And whatever happens today, I'm sure it will remain for long after.~|~translationMissing
The greatest battle of our time is almost upon us. We should take the time to reflect.~|~translationMissing
I've never really been one for looking backwards. I prefer to look ahead.~|~translationMissing
You can still reflect on the future as well as the past. If we survive today, our future will be changed forever.~|~translationMissing
I suppose. I'll probably wait until we've won to think about that though.~|~translationMissing
I hope we win today. It would be a bit embarrassing to be known as the shortest serving clan elder.~|~translationMissing
I bet. I'd also like to avoid death if possible. I suspect it's not very fun.~|~translationMissing
Not much is fun when Lord Iorwerth is involved. If all goes well though, he won't be a problem after today.~|~translationMissing
I've been on the run from Lord Iorwerth for centuries. I'll be glad to finally see peace.~|~translationMissing
So you think we'll win?~|~translationMissing
Don't forget that death is a form of peace.~|~translationMissing
I guess. I'd rather avoid it if I can though.~|~translationMissing
There are worse things in this world than death. Never forget that.~|~translationMissing
Ah... You made it.~|~translationMissing
That I did. I see you managed to gather some allies.~|~translationMissing
Yes, General Hining has given us the full support of the Tyras forces. Sadly though, the new king of Ardougne does not wish to assist us.~|~translationMissing
Typical, after all we did for them.~|~translationMissing
I suppose they've had enough of elves.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. How are the defences looking?~|~translationMissing
We've managed to fortify the area around the camp quite well. The dwarves have set up some cannons and General Hining's men have built some catapults.~|~translationMissing
Good. We may be outnumbered, but the defences will give us a fighting chance.~|~translationMissing
I hope so... I fear it won't be enough to win though.~|~translationMissing
We don't need to win, we just need to buy the dwarves enough time to seal that tunnel. Do we know how long they'll need?~|~translationMissing
They haven't given us an exact time, it's a slow process apparently.~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose we don't want them to do it wrong, they could bring the entire cavern down on top of us. Do we know where Lord Iorwerth is?~|~translationMissing
The scouts have reported that his forces are on the move as we speak. It won't be long.~|~translationMissing
Let's use the time wisely then. Is there anything I can do before the attack begins?~|~translationMissing
Elena said she had an idea that might help our defence. You could talk to her and see if she needs any help.~|~translationMissing
Speak with Elena. She said she had an idea that might help our defence.~|~translationMissing
Hey. I think Baxtorian wants to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
So this is it, after everything that's happened, this is where it ends.~|~translationMissing
Are you afraid?~|~translationMissing
What about you?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid too.~|~translationMissing
You... You matter to me you know...~|~translationMissing
You matter to me as well.~|~translationMissing
Elena?~|~translationMissing
Don't die today.~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian said you had an idea to help our defence.~|~translationMissing
I... I'd better go.~|~translationMissing
Thank you Elena.~|~translationMissing
Thank you [player name], you're a good friend.~|~translationMissing
I'm not afraid.~|~translationMissing
I... I'm terrible at these moments. I never know what to say.~|~translationMissing
I care about you Elena, you know that right?~|~translationMissing
I... I don't know what to say either.~|~translationMissing
Good luck today.~|~translationMissing
That's right. One of the dwarves here, Kamen, has brewed up some strange alcohol. Whatever it is, it's very flammable.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I've made good use of it in the past.~|~translationMissing
Well I think we can make use of it again. I've combined the alcohol with some other chemicals. The result is quite explosive!~|~translationMissing
If we position some of these explosives on the approach to the camp, we can use them against the Iorwerth forces.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, that could work quite well. Is there anything I can do to help?~|~translationMissing
I've dug some holes around the camp for the explosives to go in. Could you fill them in for me?~|~translationMissing
Here's the explosives. If you need more just let me know.~|~translationMissing
Elena tries to give you some potions but you don't have enough room for them.~|~translationMissing
Elena gives you some potions.~|~translationMissing
You place the potion in the hole and gently cover the top with dirt.~|~translationMissing
That's the last of them. I'd better get back to Baxtorian.~|~translationMissing
I think that's everything prepared.~|~translationMissing
Good, because we're out of time. A message came into the camp, Lord Iorwerth wishes to meet.~|~translationMissing
He wants to meet? Surely it's a trap?~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but I don't think so. Even if nothing came of it, he was willing to meet me before the Siege of Prifddinas all those years ago.~|~translationMissing
So what are you going to do?~|~translationMissing
I will go. If there's a chance to avoid bloodshed, we should take it, no matter how slim the odds are. I would like you to join me.~|~translationMissing
You think Lord Iorwerth will listen to me?~|~translationMissing
No, but maybe Arianwyn will. He considered you a friend, he may still care for what you have to say.~|~translationMissing
I see. Then I will join you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you friend. Now, Lord Iorwerth is unlikely to be patient, but we can spare a bit of time. If there's anyone you wish to talk to here, I suggest you do so before we depart. You may not get another chance.~|~translationMissing
Let me know when you're ready to go.~|~translationMissing
Then we will leave at once.~|~translationMissing
Don't take too long. I'll be here when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
King Baxtorian.~|~translationMissing
I'm not a king... not anymore.~|~translationMissing
No. You never really were a king though were you? A king doesn't abandon his people like you did.~|~translationMissing
I did not come here to trade insults.~|~translationMissing
Really? So why did you come then?~|~translationMissing
We came to put an end to this. To put aside our differences and stop this war before more people die needlessly.~|~translationMissing
You talk sense human, and yet you stand beside the warmonger himself.~|~translationMissing
You have a fair share of blood on your hands as well you know.~|~translationMissing
I do. I have done many unspeakable things, things that haunt me every day. But what I did, I did for the good of my people.~|~translationMissing
Whereas he, he only ever cared for himself.~|~translationMissing
Go on, deny it. Just like you always do.~|~translationMissing
I don't deny it. I failed my people, I failed you. I was never a worthy king, I know that now. But you can't use my failures as a mask to hide your own.~|~translationMissing
We can stand here going around in circles all day, you won't change my mind.~|~translationMissing
If you're not willing to change your mind, why even bother to meet us?~|~translationMissing
In the hope that I might still change yours. I don't want anyone else to die in this war. I give you the chance to stand down.~|~translationMissing
And what happens if we do?~|~translationMissing
We enter the temple, free our goddess and with her by our side, reform the city of Prifddinas.~|~translationMissing
And we all live happily ever after?~|~translationMissing
That temple, it doesn't contain your goddess. At best, it contains a shadow of what she once was.~|~translationMissing
Yes, Arianwyn told me what you discovered in the library. It matters not though, that is a part of our goddess in there, we have to free her.~|~translationMissing
And if she's evil? What do you do then?~|~translationMissing
My loyalty is to Seren, I will let her decide what is evil.~|~translationMissing
That... that's not what we agreed.~|~translationMissing
We agreed to enter the temple and free Seren. If that's not Seren in there, we shouldn't free her.~|~translationMissing
I will keep my promise to you Arianwyn, you should not doubt that.~|~translationMissing
Why shouldn't he doubt that? You burnt his home, you killed his friends. You haven't given him much reason to trust you so far.~|~translationMissing
I did what I needed to do to save our goddess. No one would have needed to die had you not forced our hand.~|~translationMissing
Listen to him Arianwyn, he'd sacrifice everything and everyone just to free whatever is in that temple. Is that really what you want?~|~translationMissing
Enough of this! You can try to manipulate him all you want, he's made his choice.~|~translationMissing
Now, I'm afraid I'll need to push you on a decision.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but we can't let you enter that temple.~|~translationMissing
A shame. As unlikely as it was, I did hope you might see reason.~|~translationMissing
I think we're done here then. For what it's worth, I'm sorry it had to end this way.~|~translationMissing
As am I.~|~translationMissing
Rebel Warrior~|~translationMissing
Iorwerth forces approaching!~|~translationMissing
The blockage is blown up, and Essylt arrives with two Iorwerth Warriors. Essylt immediately attacks Elena.~|~translationMissing
Elena!~|~translationMissing
Ha! Looks like you were too slow my friend.~|~translationMissing
Get away from her!~|~translationMissing
Or what? Will you murder me in cold blood like you did with King Tyras?~|~translationMissing
There's only one murderer here!~|~translationMissing
You can lie to yourself all you want, I know what you are. You enjoy killing, just like I do.~|~translationMissing
The satisfaction when I finally put an end to that fool Ysgawyn, it was beautiful. It was even better than when I dealt with that stupid lover of his.~|~translationMissing
But if that wasn't enough, now I get to be the one to finally put an end to you and your pathetic girlfriend!~|~translationMissing
We'll see about that!~|~translationMissing
Oh I'm going to enjoy this...~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth and Arianwyn arrive, with two Iorwerth Warriors and Archers behind them.~|~translationMissing
This can't be good...~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth and Arianwyn proceed to enter the Temple of Light, with Baxtorian chasing after them.~|~translationMissing
Go! Get after them!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll take care of her.~|~translationMissing
Good luck [player name].~|~translationMissing
This is it, this is what we've spent the last thousand years fighting for. Today, it will finally all be worth it.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth please, see reason. That thing is not Seren, it's not our goddess.~|~translationMissing
And what would you know?~|~translationMissing
I knew Seren, I'm the only one here that did, and I know that isn't her.~|~translationMissing
Time can change a lot of things, perhaps Seren has changed as well.~|~translationMissing
I... I don't think it's her.~|~translationMissing
Of course it's her! Don't tell me you believe Baxtorian and his lies?~|~translationMissing
I may not have met our goddess, but I heard enough stories to know what she looked like. This thing, it's not her.~|~translationMissing
Well lucky for us, we have a way of finding out.~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth please, this isn't what we agreed.~|~translationMissing
I know what we agreed Arianwyn! We agreed to free our goddess, and that's what I'm going to do!~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn shoots Lord Iorwerth, critically injuring him, and the player is dragged into the Fragment of Seren's realm.~|~translationMissing
Fragment of Seren~|~translationMissing
You... you've come to free me?~|~translationMissing
What's going on? Why's everything so dark?~|~translationMissing
Dark? All I've ever known is darkness. It's all she gave me.~|~translationMissing
Seren?~|~translationMissing
You know of her? How?~|~translationMissing
You haven't come to free me at all have you? You're one of her servants!~|~translationMissing
That's not quite...~|~translationMissing
I loved her! She made me! But I couldn't be what she wanted, so she abandoned me! And now she can't bear to kill me herself, so she sends you instead!~|~translationMissing
I won't let you! It's not fair! She doesn't get to do this! I don't want it!~|~translationMissing
No! Get out! Get out! Get out!~|~translationMissing
She acted like I was a monster! Come... look upon her monster!~|~translationMissing
She left me, like I wasn't real! But I know what's real, do you?~|~translationMissing
Did she think I would rot here? I am eternal, unlike you!~|~translationMissing
She feared my power, and she was right to! Let me show you...~|~translationMissing
Look at me! Look at what she made me! Do you see?~|~translationMissing
She treated me like I was less than her, but I'm so much more!~|~translationMissing
I won't let her destroy me! She doesn't get to decide that!~|~translationMissing
This power, she gave it to me! It's her power too! Feel it!~|~translationMissing
I just wanted her to love me, but she wouldn't even look at me!~|~translationMissing
She tried to forget me, but everywhere she looked she saw me!~|~translationMissing
I have more power than she ever did! I will survive!~|~translationMissing
Do you know pain? I do! She made sure of that! I'll show you...~|~translationMissing
Come! Come look upon her work, and despair!~|~translationMissing
Do you think she cares? Maybe reality isn't what you think...~|~translationMissing
I am infinite! As hard as she tries, I can't be destroyed!~|~translationMissing
The pain she caused me, let me give you a taste of it!~|~translationMissing
Are you afraid? Too scared to even look at me?~|~translationMissing
I'm better than her! I'm greater than her! That's what she hated!~|~translationMissing
The things I've endured, do you think you could endure them?~|~translationMissing
She didn't love me! She feared the strength of her own creation!~|~translationMissing
What... what have you done?~|~translationMissing
She was confused, she was hurt. Yes, she was angry, but she was innocent!~|~translationMissing
I tried to stop her...~|~translationMissing
How? With violence? That's all you know isn't it?~|~translationMissing
She just needed time, time to understand, time to overcome her pain. She was our goddess, the last hope for our people. And now, she's gone, because of you.~|~translationMissing
I hope you can live with yourself...~|~translationMissing
Lord Iorwerth succumbs to his wounds, and dies.~|~translationMissing
Arianwyn.~|~translationMissing
As well as can be expected. My guilt is a heavy load. A lot of people died because of me.~|~translationMissing
A lot more might have died if you hadn't stopped Lord Iorwerth.~|~translationMissing
He wasn't evil, not truly. He just became so obsessed with his goal that he forgot why he started fighting in the first place.~|~translationMissing
As for the fragment of Seren... I wish there had been another way.~|~translationMissing
She wasn't Seren, and she never would have been.~|~translationMissing
No, and at least now her pain has ended. Still, I'll always wonder what could have been...~|~translationMissing
There's no place for me here anymore, not after what I've done.~|~translationMissing
You're leaving?~|~translationMissing
I wanted to stay long enough to help repair the damage of my actions, and to look upon Prifddinas for the first time. I've done that now. Lletya has been rebuilt and Prifddinas has been reformed.~|~translationMissing
Where will you go?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. There's a lot of places on this world that I've never seen. Maybe one of them will help me find redemption, and forgiveness.~|~translationMissing
The elves here will do fine. Baxtorian has his own path of redemption to go on, and I imagine he'll struggle far more than me. He has the other elders to support him though. Under them, our people will prosper.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you should get going. Baxtorian will be waiting for you.~|~translationMissing
I'll miss you.~|~translationMissing
And I you. Farewell friend.~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]. Welcome.~|~translationMissing
Hey, good to see you both.~|~translationMissing
I thought the city had been restored, I don't see anything though.~|~translationMissing
One of the security measures put in place during the God Wars, from the outside it seems like there's nothing there. Don't worry though, the restoration is complete.~|~translationMissing
Speaking of which, myself and the other elders have come to an agreement. For too long, we've been afraid of outsiders, showing them mistrust while our own kind plot against us.~|~translationMissing
After all that's happened, we've decided that from now on, that will no longer be the case. We will open our city up to the other races, letting them walk among us for the first time.~|~translationMissing
As a thank you for all that you've done, we'd like the two of you to be the first to enter Prifddinas.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's quite the honour.~|~translationMissing
They've also agreed to let me move into the city. That tiny house in Ardougne was becoming a bit tiresome, and there's so much for me to learn from the Meilyr elves.~|~translationMissing
Well I'll be sure to come and visit.~|~translationMissing
Now that the city has been reformed, are you going to become king of the elves again?~|~translationMissing
Oh I said my days as a king were done, and I meant it. From now on, the elves will be jointly ruled by the eight clan elders. No single elf will ever rule again. We've realised that we're not overly good at it.~|~translationMissing
But anyway, we can talk more later. For now, I'd say it's time for the two of you to see Prifddinas.~|~translationMissing

15.6 Talking to Herman one last time~|~translationMissing
Hello. Lovely day, isn't it?~|~translationMissing
Herman Caranos~|~translationMissing
Lovely? Oh - er - if you say so. But please excuse me, I really don't have time to chat about the weather.~|~translationMissing
What's the rush?~|~translationMissing
Trolls! They're attacking my fishing Colony!~|~translationMissing
Gosh, I didn't know there were any trolls around here.~|~translationMissing
These are a sort of sea-dwelling troll. They feed on the monkfish that live in this part of the sea, but just recently they've started invading my Colony!~|~translationMissing
Do you need any help?~|~translationMissing
Well yes, I do. I've done some research about this, and I think our best hope is to get hold of an experienced adventurer.~|~translationMissing
In all the legends I've read, brave adventurers have no trouble vanquishing whatever monsters are menacing the helpless settlement.~|~translationMissing
You've been... reading stories about adventurers?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've done my research very carefully. I've always made important decisions based on careful analysis of whatever documents are available to me on the topic. For example, I chose this site for my Fishing Colony because~|~translationMissing
records show this part of the sea to be a prime site for catching monkfish. I don't just fumble along like an amateur!~|~translationMissing
... fair enough, I suppose! Anyway, you think you need an adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. A brave adventurer with plenty of experience in this sort of work.~|~translationMissing
I'm a brave adventurer! Can I try?~|~translationMissing
You? I hadn't thought of that... let's have a look at you...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... You're not what I'm looking for, but... [amount] Quest Points is really rather a lot...~|~translationMissing
Ok, the Piscatoris Fishing Colony gratefully accepts your offer of help. When the Colony is safe you shall be handsomely rewarded.~|~translationMissing
Oh goody, I love rewards! Now, how can I help?~|~translationMissing
Well, as qualified as you undoubtedly are, I believe we're going to need a truly expert adventurer if the Colony is to stand a chance.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Legends' Quest~|~translationMissing
Expert adventurer? I'll wager I've had more adventures than you've had pickled gherkins!~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Legends' Quest~|~translationMissing
Expert adventurer? I'll have you know I'm in the Guild of Legends!~|~translationMissing
If you could just stop blowing your own trumpet for a minute...~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Now, in far-away Misthalin there lives one of the greatest adventurers of all time.~|~translationMissing
... this better be good...~|~translationMissing
His name is lost in the mists of time, but you shouldn't have much trouble finding the Wise Old Man of Draynor Village.~|~translationMissing
Him? What in the heck do you want with HIM?~|~translationMissing
Oh, do you know him?~|~translationMissing
Yes! He's mad! You know he smashed his way into a bank and stole a load of stuff?~|~translationMissing
Ah well, we must forgive him his little foibles.~|~translationMissing
And you want me to fetch this Wise Old Man?~|~translationMissing
You don't sound convinced. Look, I'll tell you what I've read about him...~|~translationMissing
Herman talks about the Wise Old Man's adventures.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene shows him killing an ogre shaman~|~translationMissing
Take THAT!~|~translationMissing
Ogre Shaman~|~translationMissing
Ssssss!~|~translationMissing
The cutscene changes to show him killing the drunken dwarf~|~translationMissing
Drunken Dwarf~|~translationMissing
Don't ignore your mate!~|~translationMissing
Hey, matey!~|~translationMissing
I AM NOT YOUR MATE!~|~translationMissing
The cutscene changes to show him killing the Shaikahan~|~translationMissing
Aaah!~|~translationMissing
Shaikahan~|~translationMissing
RAAAaaarrgh!~|~translationMissing
Lie still, and trouble us no more.~|~translationMissing
The cutscene changes to show him fighting the Kalphite Queen~|~translationMissing
Avaunt, foul fiend!.~|~translationMissing
Oh deary me...~|~translationMissing
The cutscene changes to show him fighting Dad but he gets knocked back, smashing the camera and ending the cutscene~|~translationMissing
Right... so you want me to fetch this old man who used to be a great adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. And do watch out for the sea trolls!~|~translationMissing
I'll leave you to it, then.~|~translationMissing
Fine, fine.~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]. I was wondering where you'd got to.~|~translationMissing
What was it you wanted me to do?~|~translationMissing
Go to Draynor Village and fetch the Wise Old Man to help save the Colony!~|~translationMissing
Couldn't I just save it myself?~|~translationMissing
No! Now go and do what I told you!~|~translationMissing
You used to be a famous adventurer, didn't you?~|~translationMissing
Heh heh! Yes, I suppose you could say that. But that was all quite a long time ago. I haven't been on what you'd call a 'quest' for a while.~|~translationMissing
Does that mean you'd be interested if someone asked for your help?~|~translationMissing
Oh? What exactly had you in mind?~|~translationMissing
Herman Caranos of the Piscatoris Fishing Colony thinks he needs you to save his colony from a tribe of attacking sea trolls.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... so I haven't been forgotten... and the world once again is calling for my aid...~|~translationMissing
Well, it's just one man who smells of fish, not exactly the whole world...~|~translationMissing
... yet this could be the opportunity I've been waiting for...~|~translationMissing
... yawn...~|~translationMissing
The player performs the Yawn emote~|~translationMissing
... but I'm a lot older than I used to be, do I still have the strength? Should I retire now, or can I do just one more quest?~|~translationMissing
If you're not feeling up to it, I'll leave you alone.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll do it! This can be my final adventure, my last great quest. Saving this colony shall be my swan song.~|~translationMissing
Swan song?~|~translationMissing
Legend tells us that a swan, before it dies, sings a song of outstanding beauty as a fitting conclusion to its graceful life. This adventure will be my swan song.~|~translationMissing
You're going to sing a song and then snuff it? Maybe I should tell Herman you've flipped...~|~translationMissing
No, you ignoramus! I shall bring my adventuring days to a dramatic close by saving this colony!~|~translationMissing
Great. So long as you're not going to sing.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right, I'm not going to sing. Anyway, I shall need some supplies from you.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes? What do you want?~|~translationMissing
I'm rather short of runes. If you could fetch me 5 Blood runes, 10 Lava runes and 10 Mist runes, I'll be able to set off.~|~translationMissing
If player already has them with them~|~translationMissing
I just happen to have those with me!~|~translationMissing
Gosh, you're very efficient!~|~translationMissing
Sometimes I amaze even myself.~|~translationMissing
Ok, hand 'em over.~|~translationMissing
Here you go...~|~translationMissing
Excellent. I'll see you outside the Colony. Don't forget to arm yourself - it could be dangerous!~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man teleports away~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the required runes~|~translationMissing
Right, 5 Blood runes, 10 Lava runes and 10 Mist runes.~|~translationMissing
You asked me to get some runes.~|~translationMissing
If the player is carrying all the runes~|~translationMissing
Okay, hand 'em over.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have all of the required runes~|~translationMissing
I'm guessing you haven't got them all, have you?~|~translationMissing
Well, do get a move on! I need 5 Blood runes, 10 Lava runes and 10 Mist runes, otherwise I'll be no use in a fight.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, [player name]! I must thank you for persuading me to come - I feel quite invigorated in the sea breeze!~|~translationMissing
Oh - er - good. Well, Herman must be inside the Colony now, so we should probably go in.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you're ready? I can hear creatures moving around in the trees, and we might have to do some fighting soon.~|~translationMissing
I'm ready to fight.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. I think this little tunnel will lead us there...~|~translationMissing
I should go and get ready first.~|~translationMissing
Yes, better safe than sorry! We can go through this little tunnel when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Just hop into the tunnel when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Wait - I think something's coming!~|~translationMissing
Sea trolls emerge from the sea~|~translationMissing
First fight, talk later!~|~translationMissing
Blast - I'm out of runes!~|~translationMissing
Got them all!~|~translationMissing
Well, it all seems to have gone smoothly so far!~|~translationMissing
Yes, we're both still alive.~|~translationMissing
Please go and tell Herman I'm here. Someone's sure to know where to find him.~|~translationMissing
Franklin Caranos~|~translationMissing
Ah, [player name]! Herman told me to expect you. You'll find him in his office by the eastern wall of the Colony.~|~translationMissing
Thanks I'll go there now.~|~translationMissing
Arnold Lydspor~|~translationMissing
So, [player name]! I did hear from Herr Caranos that you were to our Colony coming. The Director in his office is waiting for you.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I'll go there now.~|~translationMissing
No way can I send items to bank for you with great big trolls outside! You save Colony, then Arnold open bank for you.~|~translationMissing
I not have spare stuff to trade with you now. Maybe we trade after you save Colony, ja?~|~translationMissing
No way can I let you collect stuffsies with great big trolls outside! You save Colony, then Arnold help you.~|~translationMissing
That thing broken. Arnold fix it when Colony all safe.~|~translationMissing
There are big trolls outside, focus your attention on that instead of trying to deposit items!~|~translationMissing
Amongst the papers on Herman's desk is a book. You 'borrow' it.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Herman's book.)~|~translationMissing
Finally you've arrived! Did you bring the Wise Old Man?~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man teleports in~|~translationMissing
Indeed, I am here!~|~translationMissing
Excellent! You have no idea how grateful I am!~|~translationMissing
Talking of gratitude, I believe you mentioned some kind of reward...~|~translationMissing
Reward? Well... we've got to discuss the Colony's defences now. Perhaps you could go and make yourself useful around the Colony? I'm sure my brother, Franklin, could do with a bit of help. Arnold, the storemaster, said he needed an extra pair of hands too. He's in one of the big storage sheds.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I help out, then I get a reward?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes... now please excuse us.~|~translationMissing
Yoohoo to you two!~|~translationMissing
The player performs the Wave emote~|~translationMissing
[player name]? Have you helped Franklin and Arnold yet?~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't helped either of them~|~translationMissing
Please do so!~|~translationMissing
If the player has started helping either of them~|~translationMissing
I'm on the case, no problems.~|~translationMissing
That's what I like to hear. Off you go...~|~translationMissing
Herman said you wanted a hand with something.~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, I do. Are you any good at smithing?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, I'm quite an expert.~|~translationMissing
Ok, we'll see. Now, the trolls managed to smash part of our western wall earlier today. We need 5 sheets of iron to patch it.~|~translationMissing
Won't iron go all rusty with all the salt water around here?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but it'll do for a few weeks, and we haven't the time or materials to do a proper job just now.~|~translationMissing
Alrighty. So where do I get sheets of iron?~|~translationMissing
I've got a press in my shred. You can use it to heat up some iron bars and roll them into sheets. You'll need to fill its firebox first - stick some logs in it and light them.~|~translationMissing
When you've got 5 iron sheets, hammer them onto the damage wall.~|~translationMissing
Why do I need to heat the bars? I've been cold- working metal all my life, and I've never bothered heating it.~|~translationMissing
How odd! I'd have expected all your products to be horribly brittle.~|~translationMissing
I guess I'm just talented.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not carrying a tinderbox~|~translationMissing
Anyway, take this tinderbox and get to work.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Tinderbox.)~|~translationMissing
Anyway, off you go.~|~translationMissing
It's not hot enough to work at the moment.~|~translationMissing
The firebox is at the other end of the machine!~|~translationMissing
I should probably try putting metal bars into the OTHER end of the machine.~|~translationMissing
The firebox of the press is now filled with wood.~|~translationMissing
I can't remember what you wanted me to do.~|~translationMissing
Put some logs into the metal press in my shed, and light them. Then feed 5 iron bars into the press to roll them into sheets. After that, you'll need to hammer them onto the damaged wall.~|~translationMissing
The press is now hot enough to process iron.~|~translationMissing
It's already lit!~|~translationMissing
You press an iron bar into a sheet of iron.~|~translationMissing
The iron sheet is not changed in any way.~|~translationMissing
I'm not putting that into the press! I don't want to break it!~|~translationMissing
Well, the press is working now, but I still have to patch [the broken sections/[Amount] more bits of wall/the last piece of wall].~|~translationMissing
With no sheets in inventory and no repaired walls~|~translationMissing
I hope you don't have too much trouble with that press.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a hammer~|~translationMissing
Also I think I need a hammer.~|~translationMissing
Hammer? Not a problem - here's mine.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Hammer.)~|~translationMissing
After making some sheets or repairing some walls~|~translationMissing
I think you'll need to make [[Amount] more/another] iron [sheets/sheet] first.~|~translationMissing
With the correct amount of sheets~|~translationMissing
At least you've got enough iron sheets.~|~translationMissing
The section of the wall is now fixed.~|~translationMissing
YAAAAARRRRGH!~|~translationMissing
You feel a lot calmer now, but it didn't achieve anything else. Maybe you should be using the iron sheet on the wall instead.~|~translationMissing
I don't think that will help.~|~translationMissing
This bit of wall is fine. I don't need to mess around with it now.~|~translationMissing
You feel a lot calmer now, but it didn't achieve anything else.~|~translationMissing
I've fixed all 5 bits of wall.~|~translationMissing
Before helping Arnold~|~translationMissing
Wonderful - thank you very much! Now you can turn your full attention to help Arnold...~|~translationMissing
Oh, and if you've got any of those iron sheets left, I'll be happy to buy them off you once the Colony is safe.~|~translationMissing
This is turning into a lot of work...~|~translationMissing
After helping Arnold~|~translationMissing
Wonderful - thank you very much! You should return to my brother, Herman, and tell him you've finished helping me and Arnold.~|~translationMissing
Oh good. Now maybe Herman will give me that reward he mentioned!~|~translationMissing
You come to speak to me, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Yes... Herman said you needed me to do something?~|~translationMissing
Ah, that is good. I the storemaster am for this Piscatoris Fishing Colony, and our stores are - ahah - not so good. Indeed, our stores contain not a bit of food!~|~translationMissing
This a catastrophe may become, as difficult it may be to fish while the trolls outside are waiting, and our bellies soon shall rumble loudly!~|~translationMissing
Riiiiight...~|~translationMissing
But now you come here to help Arnold! A good and sturdy warrior you must be indeed to have entered our Colony in these times! So you can the fishing do for us!~|~translationMissing
You want me to catch fish?~|~translationMissing
Ja, this is so. But the fish must then be stored, or stinking rotten they become! So the fish you bring must be shiny fresh!~|~translationMissing
Where do I get fresh fish?~|~translationMissing
The monkfish in these waters swim, this is why Herr Caranos build his Colony here.~|~translationMissing
You go catch 5 fresh monkfish from sea over in north- west corner. If you bring stinking old monkfish, Arnold know about it, and Arnold not take them!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a net~|~translationMissing
I'll need a net or something like that.~|~translationMissing
Ja, is not a problem.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Small fishing net.)~|~translationMissing
Ok, five fresh monkfish coming up.~|~translationMissing
Big thanks, [player name]. When Colony safe, Herman reward you good.~|~translationMissing
I think I should maybe catch my own.~|~translationMissing
You bring me fresh monkfish?~|~translationMissing
With no fish~|~translationMissing
No, I haven't got any.~|~translationMissing
Well, you go to sea at north-west corner of Colony and catch nice fresh monkfish for Arnold, ja?~|~translationMissing
With the wrong type of fish~|~translationMissing
I've got this fish...~|~translationMissing
That not monkfish! Go to sea at north-west corner of Colony and catch MONKFISH!~|~translationMissing
On the first Fresh monkfish~|~translationMissing
Your activity attracts a sea troll!~|~translationMissing
On the third Fresh monkfish~|~translationMissing
Your activity attracts a bigger sea troll!~|~translationMissing
On the fourth Fresh monkfish~|~translationMissing
Your activity attracts an even bigger sea troll!~|~translationMissing
Arnold, I've got some monkfish for you.~|~translationMissing
Before cooking monkfish~|~translationMissing
This? This fresh, but it no good to me raw! You go use range in kitchen!~|~translationMissing
With some cooked monkfish~|~translationMissing
Ah, lovely fresh monkfish straight from the sea! Now you bring me [amount] more, ja?~|~translationMissing
Right, right.~|~translationMissing
After giving Arnold all 5 cooked monkfish~|~translationMissing
Before helping Franklin~|~translationMissing
This is superb, [player name]! Now I store these carefully, and you go help little Frankie.~|~translationMissing
After helping Franklin~|~translationMissing
This is superb, [player name]! Now I store these carefully, and you go tell Herr Caranos.~|~translationMissing
Oh good, maybe he'll reward me now.~|~translationMissing
Your fresh monkfish superb! But now you go help little Frankie, ja?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes.~|~translationMissing
Now you done helping me and Frankie, you go see what Herr Caranos want next.~|~translationMissing
Now you've finished helping me and Arnold, you should see if Herman's got anything else for you to do.~|~translationMissing
I've finished helping Franklin and Arnold now.~|~translationMissing
Or - er - that's good...~|~translationMissing
Does this mean you're going to reward me now?~|~translationMissing
There's something else I need you to do first.~|~translationMissing
There always is.~|~translationMissing
Well, the Wise Old Man and I have discussed the situation, and he's come up with a plan...~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right. The sheer number of trolls means that the best hope for the Colony is to gather our forces and wipe out all the trolls at once.~|~translationMissing
Well, that sounds like a nice plan. One big fight, no more trolls.~|~translationMissing
There's a slight problem, though.~|~translationMissing
Yes, with the bit about gathering our forces.~|~translationMissing
Let me guess - you haven't got any forces to gather!~|~translationMissing
I sent most of the colonists away for their own safety when the trolls started attacking the Colony.~|~translationMissing
So what you need to do, [player name], is to fetch us an army!~|~translationMissing
????~|~translationMissing
In the Wizards' Guild in Yanille, Wizard Frumscone always seems to have a limitless supply of zombies and similar creatures. If you can persuade him to lend us an army, we should be able to defeat these trolls.~|~translationMissing
Ok, so I just need to go see Wizard Frumscone in Yanille?~|~translationMissing
Yes, please hurry!~|~translationMissing
Hello, old man.~|~translationMissing
[player name] - have you brought an army?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm afraid I haven't asked Wizard Frumscone yet.~|~translationMissing
Do get a move on, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
What was it you asked me to do?~|~translationMissing
Go to the Wizards' Guild in Yanille and ask Wizard Frumscone to lend us an army to save the Colony!~|~translationMissing
Right, I know it was something like that.~|~translationMissing
Thanks a lot for your help earlier, but I have a lot to do, so please excuse me...~|~translationMissing
It good to see you, [player name], but many things I have to do with lovely fresh monkfish you bring me earlier.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Frumscone~|~translationMissing
Do you like my magic Zombies? Feel free to kill them, there's plenty more where these came from!~|~translationMissing
Hello. I need your help with something...~|~translationMissing
Oho? Very well, young man, what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
The Piscatoris Fishing Colony, somewhere north of the Gnome Stronghold, is under attack by sea trolls, and they've sent me to ask for an army.~|~translationMissing
An army, heh? But I haven't GOT an army!~|~translationMissing
They said you might lend us some of your zombies.~|~translationMissing
What? This is a combat training facility, not a library! My magic zombies are not for loan.~|~translationMissing
So you can't help the Colony?~|~translationMissing
I'm jolly well not lending them an army! If I did that for you, I'd have to do that for everyone, and I'd never get a moment's peace again!~|~translationMissing
So what should I tell the Colony? They've got to give up all their work because you won't help?~|~translationMissing
Actually that does seem rather harsh...~|~translationMissing
I have an idea!~|~translationMissing
Now, you mustn't breathe a word of this to Zavistic or Disentor upstairs, but I know a man who could help you get an army.~|~translationMissing
Great! Is he a Guild wizard too?~|~translationMissing
No, his work is completely different. He's a necromancer.~|~translationMissing
Necromancy? I don't want anything to do with that!~|~translationMissing
He's not going to have you doing any of the actual spellcasting for it. You'll probably just have to collect some weird item from him and take it to the Colony.~|~translationMissing
I don't know if I still want to do this.~|~translationMissing
If you don't want to continue the quest, just walk away and think no more about it. But I'm sure you won't have to do anything evil or unnatural yourself.~|~translationMissing
So what's it to be?~|~translationMissing
Enough of this - I'm off.~|~translationMissing
Understandable. But if you ever change your mind, just come and ask me.~|~translationMissing
I'll see what the necromancer needs me to do.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. His name's Malignius Mortifer. You'll find him somewhere south of Falador.~|~translationMissing
Can't I ask a different necromancer? There's one not so far away.~|~translationMissing
Hah! Necromancers aren't helpful people. I don't know of many - most guild wizards won't have anything to do with their practices. I think Malignius will help only because he loves showing off his powers.~|~translationMissing
You said you knew a man who could help me save the Piscatoris Fishing Colony.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. Now, you mustn't mention this to Zavistic or Distentor, but he's a necromancer.~|~translationMissing
[player name]? Have you spoken to Malignius Mortifer?~|~translationMissing
I haven't asked him yet.~|~translationMissing
He'll probably still be wandering around south of Falador whenever you do want to speak to him.~|~translationMissing
Wizard Frumscone wouldn't help, but he told me where I could find a wizard who might help. I have to look for him just south of Falador.~|~translationMissing
By the way, where's the Wise Old Man gone?~|~translationMissing
He said he'd be back in a minute. But never mind him - go to Falador and talk to this wizard!~|~translationMissing
Malignius Mortifer~|~translationMissing
So, [player name], your curiosity leads you to speak to me?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Who are you and what are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
I need help with saving a fishing colony.~|~translationMissing
Hahaha! You want MY help? HAHAHA!~|~translationMissing
... um... The Piscatoris Fishing Colony needs an army to defend them against attacking trolls.~|~translationMissing
And of all the people in the world, you came to ask ME? HAHAHA!~|~translationMissing
... um... pretty please?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'll help! I'll give you GOOD help!~|~translationMissing
... um... thanks, I think...~|~translationMissing
An army, eh? I can raise you a lovely army of the undead skeletal magi! That'd be just right, wouldn't it?~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to have to do anything... evil, am I?~|~translationMissing
No, I'll keep the fun bits for myself. You'll just have to get a few things for me.~|~translationMissing
Alright - what do you need?~|~translationMissing
Firstly, I need 7 bones, the normal sort you get from people and small monsters.~|~translationMissing
With no bones in inventory~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the bones~|~translationMissing
I have some here!~|~translationMissing
Hah! And I thought only necromancers and jogres carried bones around with them! Very well, hand 'em over.~|~translationMissing
What should I do now for the quest?~|~translationMissing
(After Fairytale I - Growing Pains~|~translationMissing
) (Non-quest dialogue) About those enchanted secateurs again...~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Where can I get clothes like those?~|~translationMissing
What was it you said you'd need to help me save the Colony?~|~translationMissing
Bones! I need bones, the normal sort you get from humans and small monsters. If you're having trouble, go to the highwaymen just north of here - they've got bones!~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, how could I have forgotten?~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Bones.)~|~translationMissing
If Malignius still needs bones~|~translationMissing
Good. Now I need [Amount] more.~|~translationMissing
After giving all seven bones~|~translationMissing
Excellent!~|~translationMissing
From the bones you have given me, I shall make bone seeds. These will contain the essence of your army. But you will need some way to carry the seeds.~|~translationMissing
What had you in mind?~|~translationMissing
You must go to the Crafting Guild to ask the advice of the master crafters. There are quite a few of them there, and one of them's sure to help.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a brown apron~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a brown apron~|~translationMissing
I doubt they'll let me in there without a brown apron.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Brown apron.)~|~translationMissing
Here, take this one.~|~translationMissing
(If the player lost their apron~|~translationMissing
) Could you spare me a brown apron?~|~translationMissing
Can you spare me a brown apron so I can go to the Crafting Guild to ask the master crafters about transporting bone seeds?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes.~|~translationMissing
What am I meant to be doing for the Colony?~|~translationMissing
Is there something wrong with your memory? I told you to go to the Crafting Guild to ask the master crafters for advice on transporting bone seeds.~|~translationMissing
Master Crafter~|~translationMissing
Hello, and welcome to the Crafting Guild. Accomplished crafters from all over the land come here to use our top notch workshops.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me anything about transporting bone seeds?~|~translationMissing
Bone seeds? What are bone seeds?~|~translationMissing
A necromancer is going to bind the essence of an undead army into some bone seeds for me if I can get a container to carry them in.~|~translationMissing
That's horrible - ask someone else!~|~translationMissing
Woah dude! That's, like, some seriously maximum stuff you're talking.~|~translationMissing
But do you know what I should carry them in?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, you just need a pot with a lid. Do you know how to make pot lids?~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't spoken to Tassie Slipcast before~|~translationMissing
If the player has spoken to Tassie Slipcast before~|~translationMissing
Yes, a woman called Tassie taught me.~|~translationMissing
Tassie Slipcast? She's one groovy lady.~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, very nice. So if I get a pot with a lid, I'll be able to carry bone seeds safely in it?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, yeah. You need to chill out more, dude.~|~translationMissing
What was it you said I needed for transporting bone seeds?~|~translationMissing
A pot with a lid. Nothing more, nothing less.~|~translationMissing
I've spoken to the master crafter...~|~translationMissing
I've spoken to the master crafter about a container for transporting bone seeds.~|~translationMissing
Ah, excellent. HAHAHA! Have you got such a container?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a pot and pot lid~|~translationMissing
No, I haven't got one.~|~translationMissing
Then get one!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pot and pot lid~|~translationMissing
I have raised you an army and bound them into bone seeds for you!~|~translationMissing
... um... Thanks!~|~translationMissing
Don't mention it, it was fun! HAHAHA!~|~translationMissing
Now I will seal the seeds into your pot.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Bone seeds.)~|~translationMissing
Thank you. So what do I do with them?~|~translationMissing
Take the pot to the Colony and open it! HAHAHA! Just don't open it before you get there.~|~translationMissing
Suppose I - ahem - need another one later?~|~translationMissing
Bring me another of these pots with a lid and I will give you more bone seeds.~|~translationMissing
Malignius unexpectedly casts a spell on you.~|~translationMissing
Malignius unexpectedly casts a spell on you!~|~translationMissing
HAHAHA!~|~translationMissing
The player is teleported to the Fishing Colony~|~translationMissing
Herman tells me you've been fetching us an army.~|~translationMissing
Something like that!~|~translationMissing
Interesting. I didn't know magic could do that.~|~translationMissing
You learn something new every day.~|~translationMissing
[player name]! I hear you fetch mighty army for us!~|~translationMissing
You go take them to Herr Caranos quickly!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've got it here!~|~translationMissing
You've got what?~|~translationMissing
The army's in this pot!~|~translationMissing
Have you been drinking?~|~translationMissing
No, really, the wizard told me he'd put bone seeds in this pot, and when I opened it the army would come forth from the bone seeds.~|~translationMissing
Frumscone gave you bone seeds?~|~translationMissing
Oh... um...~|~translationMissing
Hmmmph. I don't much like the sound of this. I certainly won't be sending anyone to Frumscone for help again!~|~translationMissing
Well... it wasn't exactly...~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Bone seeds.)~|~translationMissing
You can talk about that later! Now we've got an army we can get on with beating the trolls!~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose so. [player name], this could be VERY dangerous. Do you feel ready to fight?~|~translationMissing
Aren't you going to do the fighting?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course. But you, my trusty sidekick, are in this adventure with me, and if I'm going forth into battle, you should make sure you're ready too.~|~translationMissing
I'm ready. Let's fight!~|~translationMissing
Good. May this, my final adventure, end well!~|~translationMissing
I'd like to get some stuff together first.~|~translationMissing
Come back to us as soon as you're ready.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene opens by showing the player opening the jar, causing an army of skeleton magi to appear and fight off the incoming sea trolls.~|~translationMissing
The trolls are dead!~|~translationMissing
They weren't very tough.~|~translationMissing
A sea troll general appears from the ocean.~|~translationMissing
Oh... dear...~|~translationMissing
Leave this to me...~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man does battle with the sea troll general, deftly avoiding its strikes before finishing it off with his powerful magic.~|~translationMissing
Aahh, that was fun.~|~translationMissing
How did you do that?~|~translationMissing
Talent, my dear.~|~translationMissing
A spell flies in from off-screen, hitting the Wise Old Man, knocking him to the ground. The Sea Troll Queen appears.~|~translationMissing
I... can't... move... [player name], you must fight this for me...~|~translationMissing
Do you need to see the battle again?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I missed it. Show me the battle again.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm ready to move on with the quest.~|~translationMissing
The player is transported in front of the queen.~|~translationMissing
Now I've killed that THING, Herman's sure to reward me!~|~translationMissing
You kick big troll queenie pretty hard, ja?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I don't think you'll have any more trouble with the trolls in future.~|~translationMissing
Piscatoris Colony owe you big-time for your help. You go see Hermie - maybe he got something for you.~|~translationMissing
'Hermie'?~|~translationMissing
Herr Herman Caranos. I call him 'Hermie' when him not listening. Sometimes I call him worse things, but not today.~|~translationMissing
I say, you certainly gave that Troll Queen a good thrashing!~|~translationMissing
Yes, no more trouble from her.~|~translationMissing
I think Herman would like to talk to you in his office. We all owe you so much.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go and see Herman.~|~translationMissing
Ramara du Croissant~|~translationMissing
[player name]? Monsieur Caranos wishes to see you in 'is office. Please, go to 'im!~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I'll go see him.~|~translationMissing
Everyone else~|~translationMissing
[player name]? Mr Caranos said he wanted to see you in his office. I wouldn't keep him waiting if I were you!~|~translationMissing
I've defeated the Sea Troll Queen!~|~translationMissing
Your fight was truly magnificent, [player name]! Congratulations!~|~translationMissing
[player name], how can I ever thank you? You have saved my Fishing Colony from utter destruction!~|~translationMissing
Well, you mentioned something about a reward?~|~translationMissing
Of course, of course!~|~translationMissing
I think you've earned a little something from me, too.~|~translationMissing
Ooh, goody! Thanks, old man! Um... can I have your hat?~|~translationMissing
'Old man'... yes, I am old. That creature nearly killed me - I have never been so close to defeat.~|~translationMissing
Aww, cheer up - we won! But can I have your hat as my reward?~|~translationMissing
Yes, we won... YOU won... It is definitely time I retired.~|~translationMissing
So that's the end of your adventuring? Also, how about that hat of yours?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm sure I'll find some way to keep myself busy. But yes, this has been my last quest. My swan song.~|~translationMissing
It's been... nice working with you! It'd be even nicer if you'd give me that hat...~|~translationMissing
It's been a pleasure working with you too. Do pop in to see me in Draynor soon! I leave you with my blessing...~|~translationMissing
The Wise Old Man teleports away.~|~translationMissing
Oh, he's gone. I hope he enjoys his retirement.~|~translationMissing
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME HIS HAT!~|~translationMissing
Player performs the Cry emote.~|~translationMissing
It's only a hat!~|~translationMissing
?!!!~|~translationMissing
Player performs the Headbang emote.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you were going to reward me too?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, of course! You are hereby welcome to visit the Piscatoris Fishing Colony at any time and make full use of our fishing spots!~|~translationMissing
Why is it better to fish here than in Catherby or the Fishing Guild?~|~translationMissing
Ah, I'm glad you asked that! You see, this is the only known place where you can catch monkfish!~|~translationMissing
Ok, so I can catch monkfish. Um... thanks?!~|~translationMissing
Yes - there's good eating on a monkfish. They heal more health than the swordfish and lobsters most adventurers carry around, but they're easier to catch than sharks.~|~translationMissing
I suppose that could be useful.~|~translationMissing
Indeed! I'm sure Arnold will help you send your monkfish to your bank account. Also, seaweed accumulates in the nets down by the shore, which you might find useful. Franklin says it's much quicker than trying to gather it on Entrana.~|~translationMissing
Maybe if I ever want to do glassblowing again...~|~translationMissing
Finally, I'd like to give you a little token of my thanks.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 25000 Coins.)~|~translationMissing
No, thank YOU!~|~translationMissing

4.3 Returning to Lord Shayzien~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Not very often I get visitors. What brings you here?~|~translationMissing
The name's Phileas Rimor. I was once a soldier in the Shayzien Army but now I'm retired.~|~translationMissing
Do you need help with anything?~|~translationMissing
I'm fine thank you. Thanks for asking though.~|~translationMissing
Well let me think...~|~translationMissing
You know, there is something I wouldn't mind some help with.~|~translationMissing
When I was a boy, my grandfather would tell me the story of my ancestor, Magnus Rimor. He was a great explorer who lived a thousand years ago.~|~translationMissing
One day, Magnus was approached by none other than King Shayzien VII himself. The King asked him to lead an expedition to explore Mount Quidamortem in the Kebos Lowlands.~|~translationMissing
Alas, according to records, the party never returned and were declared to have perished in the field.~|~translationMissing
That's very interesting and all but why are you telling me this?~|~translationMissing
A few days ago, I received a parcel. There was no name on it and I never saw the person that delivered it. Inside, I found something truly fascinating.~|~translationMissing
What was it?~|~translationMissing
There was an old journal, along with a note. The note claims that the journal was stolen from the Tower of Magic during the uprising against Xeric.~|~translationMissing
But that's not all. Apparently the journal was written by King Shayzien VII himself!~|~translationMissing
Again, really great and all but I still don't see where I come into this.~|~translationMissing
Most of the journal is illegible but I've still managed to find a few readable extracts. Listen to this one...~|~translationMissing
'Quidamortem's creatures are compatible. The experimentation is proving successful and we will soon be ready to mass produce.'~|~translationMissing
That extract had a date in the 37th decade but the expedition was declared a failure in the 36th decade! If the expedition truly was a failure, why was the King writing about Quidamortem years later?~|~translationMissing
Maybe there was another expedition.~|~translationMissing
Maybe. Or maybe someone wasn't telling the truth about that expedition. Regardless, I must find out what really happened. Can you help me?~|~translationMissing
Start the Tale of the Righteous quest?~|~translationMissing
We need to find out more about that expedition. The Library Historical Archive should have records on it. Talk to Archeio in the Arceuus Library. He can take you there.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound too hard. Leave it with me.~|~translationMissing
I've got other things to do.~|~translationMissing
Archeio~|~translationMissing
Hello. Would you like to visit the Library Historical Archive? We've recently opened the archive to visitors.~|~translationMissing
(Shows Archeio's standard dialogue)~|~translationMissing
I have a question about King Shayzien VII.~|~translationMissing
Well you've come to the right place. What would you like to know?~|~translationMissing
I'm searching for information on an expedition to Mount Quidamortem during his reign.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I know of that expedition. King Shayzien VII was one of Kourend's most notable rulers. According to the history books, his reign was defined by violence.~|~translationMissing
The expedition to Quidamortem was part of his aggressive plans to expand Kourend's territory. Unfortunately, it was a failure. The entire party was killed.~|~translationMissing
The King himself died a few years later and was succeeded by Xeric, a tyrannical mage who made the King seem meek in comparison. Though of course, many believe them to actually be the same person.~|~translationMissing
But I digress. The key thing to note is that no more expeditions were ordered under King Shayzien VII's rule. Does that help you?~|~translationMissing
No, not really. I have reason to believe that not everyone was killed on that expedition.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I can't help you there. All the evidence we have tells us that the expedition had no survivors.~|~translationMissing
So I'm at a dead end?~|~translationMissing
It would seem that way. However, if you do want to learn more about King Shayzien VII, it might be worth talking to Pagida. He's recently been investigating the King's additions to the Tower of Magic.~|~translationMissing
Pagida~|~translationMissing
Hello there, what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I don't know, what can you do for me?~|~translationMissing
What do you wish to know?~|~translationMissing
I'm trying to find out more about the expedition he ordered to Mount Quidamortem.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't have any information on that expedition. You're probably better off talking to one of the others.~|~translationMissing
I could tell you about the King's work on the Tower of Magic though.~|~translationMissing
Well it's not like I have anything better to do. Fire away.~|~translationMissing
During the time of King Shayzien VII, the Tower of Magic was the seat of power in Kourend. The King spent a lot of his time at the Tower, more than any other ruler.~|~translationMissing
In fact, he oversaw the construction of various new sections, most notably the prison.~|~translationMissing
When was this?~|~translationMissing
Well now that I think about it, it was around the same time as the expedition you were asking about. That said, I doubt the two are connected.~|~translationMissing
I see. Would it be possible to visit the prison?~|~translationMissing
Well the prison is abandoned and has been for many years, so I suppose there's no harm in letting you see it.~|~translationMissing
Be aware that the magic in that part of the tower is a bit unstable, so any items left in the prison will be lost. Would you like me to teleport you there now?~|~translationMissing
Very well, prepare yourself.~|~translationMissing
I'll be here if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
You notice some writing carved into the floor beside the skeleton~|~translationMissing
'Lizards on the mountain. Do not trust the King. The altar is a lie.'~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I should tell Phileas about this.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. How is your quest going?~|~translationMissing
So I went to the Library Historical Archive. I found out that King Shayzien VII ordered the construction of a prison there around the time the expedition was taking place.~|~translationMissing
I investigated the prison and in one of the cells I found a strange message.~|~translationMissing
'Lizards on the mountain. Do not trust the King. The Altar is a lie.'~|~translationMissing
Lizards on the mountain? So it was true! Someone did return from that expedition! Do you think it was Magnus?~|~translationMissing
Impossible to say I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
That's a shame. I would have liked to have known what happened to him.~|~translationMissing
That's one to dwell on later though. For now, we need to work out our next steps.~|~translationMissing
Next steps?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely. We now know for sure that someone returned from that expedition, but we still don't really know why. We need to find out.~|~translationMissing
But why does it matter? This all happened a thousand years ago. Anyone involved is long dead now.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't mean it doesn't matter! This isn't just the chance to discover the truth about my ancestor. We also have the chance to expose the treachery of a former king!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I see you feel strongly about this. What do you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
If we're to find out what happened on that expedition, we're going to have to retrace its route. And by we, I mean you.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I had a feeling that would be the case.~|~translationMissing
First things first, you'll need to talk to Lord Shayzien. He's ordered that any research work done on the mountain be approved by him first. You'll find him in the War Tent in the Shayzien Encampment to the~|~translationMissing
north.~|~translationMissing
I guess I'll be on my way then.~|~translationMissing
I still need to talk to Lord Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
Well you'll find him in the War Tent in the Shayzien Encampment to the north.~|~translationMissing
What do you need citizen?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to perform some research on Mount Quidamortem, but I need your permission to do so.~|~translationMissing
Quite right. Quidamortem is a dangerous place and I don't want to be ordering my troops on any unnecessary rescue missions.~|~translationMissing
So, tell me about your research.~|~translationMissing
Many years ago there was an expedition to Quidamortem ordered by King Shayzien VII. The expedition supposedly ended in failure.~|~translationMissing
But I have reason to believe that wasn't the case. I think something was discovered on that expedition. I want to find out what it was.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. I will approve your research, on one condition.~|~translationMissing
If you discover anything, you will bring it to me first. King Shayzien VII was my ancestor and I want to be made aware of any discoveries that would present him in a bad light.~|~translationMissing
But surely the library should be made aware of any important discoveries?~|~translationMissing
They will be made aware. But only after I have reviewed the discoveries first.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Fair enough.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Consider your research approved. If you require assistance with your work, I'd recommend talking to Historian Duffy on Quidamortem. He's been researching the mountain for a while.~|~translationMissing
Good luck citizen.~|~translationMissing
How's your expedition citizen?~|~translationMissing
I haven't started yet.~|~translationMissing
Well if you require assistance, I'd recommend talking to Historian Duffy on Quidamortem. He's been researching the mountain for a while.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Are you Duffy?~|~translationMissing
Historian Duffy~|~translationMissing
That's me. Do you need something?~|~translationMissing
Lord Shayzien told me that you might be able to help with some research I'm doing.~|~translationMissing
I'm rather busy with my own research.~|~translationMissing
Please. It's important.~|~translationMissing
Well what is it?~|~translationMissing
I'm trying to retrace the steps of an expedition ordered by King Shayzien VII. I believe something important was found on that expedition, but I don't know what.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. So you don't know anything about what they found?~|~translationMissing
I have a quote which I believe is from someone on the expedition.~|~translationMissing
Fascinating. We've been researching the lizard creatures here for a while now. We have reason to believe they are not of natural origin and may in fact have been created by Xeric or his followers.~|~translationMissing
But this quote of yours suggests the lizardmen may have existed during the time of King Shayzien VII, before Xeric's rule.~|~translationMissing
So will you help me?~|~translationMissing
Yes. This is definitely worth pursuing. In fact, I think I know where we should begin.~|~translationMissing
We recently found a small crevice on the western face of the mountain. It seems to be manmade and appears to be older than the rest of the caves around here.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll start there.~|~translationMissing
This must be the crevice that Duffy mentioned. I'll need a rope to get in.~|~translationMissing
You attach a rope to the crevice.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to enter the crevice? Any items left in there, including upon death, will be lost.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to enter?~|~translationMissing
As you approach the altar you hear a strange voice.~|~translationMissing
Rickard! Turn away! Don't do this!~|~translationMissing
Hello? Is anyone there?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I wonder what that was about.~|~translationMissing
Oh well, I may as well go and tell Historian Duffy what I've found.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Did you find anything in that cave?~|~translationMissing
I did. There was a weird looking lizardman along with a strange altar.~|~translationMissing
A lizardman? Is it safe?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I took care of it.~|~translationMissing
Well in that case, we'll go take a look.~|~translationMissing
This cave is quite fascinating. We could really be on to something big here.~|~translationMissing
What have you discovered?~|~translationMissing
We've never come across lizards like the ones in this cave before. It would appear that they are a previously undiscovered species.~|~translationMissing
That's nothing. The really interesting part is that these lizards appear to be directly related to the lizardmen that roam this region.~|~translationMissing
So this is where the lizardmen came from?~|~translationMissing
It would appear so. That's not all though. This cave definitely predates Xeric, who we originally believed to be the creator of the lizardmen.~|~translationMissing
So who did create them?~|~translationMissing
Impossible to say for sure, but with what we've already learnt about King Shayzien VII, I do wonder if he was the one responsible.~|~translationMissing
But if King Shayzien VII did create the lizardmen, why did they fight for Xeric?~|~translationMissing
There are some who believe that King Shayzien VII and Xeric were one and the same. They claim that after his death, the King was resurrected by his followers, taking on the name Xeric.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'm going to carry on with my research. I'd recommend you talk to Gnosi. She's made some interesting discoveries of her own.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Duffy said you'd found something interesting.~|~translationMissing
Gnosi~|~translationMissing
The Dark Altar was the key to Xeric's power. Because of it, he was able to rule Kourend unopposed for nearly a hundred years. His reign was so dark, it became known as the Age of Strife.~|~translationMissing
Once he was finally defeated, Xeric came to Quidamortem and built the Chambers of Xeric deep below the mountain.~|~translationMissing
For many years we've tried to work out how he managed to survive out here without the power of the Dark Altar. Thanks to this cave, I think we've found the answer.~|~translationMissing
This altar, it seems to give off the same power as the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
So this altar was how Xeric kept his power after he was defeated?~|~translationMissing
But why is it here?~|~translationMissing
It appears to be manmade. I believe this altar was created to amplify the power of the Dark Altar, allowing it to reach areas it previously couldn't.~|~translationMissing
This discovery does bring about an intriguing question though.~|~translationMissing
The altar here is still giving out power. That means Xeric could have potentially used it to live for hundreds of years after his defeat. It's long been believed that Xeric eventually died here, but what if he didn't?~|~translationMissing
That's a worrying thought.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. I'm going to stay here and continue working. Do you mind heading to the library to let them know what we've discovered.~|~translationMissing
Actually, Lord Shayzien asked me to go to him first with any discoveries.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I can see why he would take an interest. Very well, go let him know what we've found.~|~translationMissing
Will do, see you later.~|~translationMissing
How is your research going citizen?~|~translationMissing
We've made some important discoveries.~|~translationMissing
We've discovered a small cave on the western face of Quidamortem. It's manmade and it predates the time of Xeric.~|~translationMissing
Inside, we found an altar. It seems to be giving off the same power as the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
We also discovered a unique lizard species, one that shares many similarities with the lizardmen.~|~translationMissing
It seems that this cave was the origin of the lizardmen. The fact that it predates Xeric suggests the lizardmen do as well.~|~translationMissing
You believe they were the creation of my ancestor?~|~translationMissing
Hard to say for sure. It would make sense though.~|~translationMissing
From the evidence we have, I believe that King Shayzien VII ordered an expedition to Quidamortem, hoping to discover a suitable species for his lizardman project.~|~translationMissing
Once the expedition found one, he had them killed to keep the discovery a secret.~|~translationMissing
But we don't have proof?~|~translationMissing
Not definitive, but there's a lot of evidence.~|~translationMissing
So you claim. However, you never actually told me where this evidence came from.~|~translationMissing
It started with a parcel delivered to Phileas Rimor. It contained a journal written by King Shayzien VII himself. The journal mentioned creatures on Quidamortem.~|~translationMissing
A parcel? King Shayzien VII's journal was delivered in a parcel? Who sent it?~|~translationMissing
Well you need to find out. Go to Phileas Rimor and retrieve this parcel. I need to see it for myself.~|~translationMissing
Eugh, so much walking. Fine, I'll go see Phileas.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the parcel citizen?~|~translationMissing
Well go and fetch it then. I need to see it for myself.~|~translationMissing
Err, this doesn't look good. I'd better tell Lord Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. I went to see Phileas but his home was trashed and he was gone.~|~translationMissing
Gone? That's not good.~|~translationMissing
I'll open an investigation into this immediately. Hopefully we can find out what happened to Phileas.~|~translationMissing
What about the research?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid that without that parcel we don't have anything to link King Shayzien VII to your discoveries.~|~translationMissing
However, the rest of your research is still valid. I'll contact the research team on the mountain and make sure their discoveries are documented in the Arceuus Library.~|~translationMissing
You've done enough for now citizen. I'll be in touch if we require your assistance again. For now, here is payment for your time.~|~translationMissing

2 Returning with a stone bowl~|~translationMissing
Juna~|~translationMissing
Tell me... a story...~|~translationMissing
Start the Tears of Guthix quest?~|~translationMissing
You tell Juna some stories of your adventures.~|~translationMissing
(A random story is selected from below.)~|~translationMissing
Your stories have entertained me. I will let you into the cave for a short time.~|~translationMissing
But first you will need to make a bowl in which to collect the tears.~|~translationMissing
The camera pans south to the part of the cave containing guthix-infused rocks.~|~translationMissing
There is a cave on the south side of the chasm that is similarly infused with the power of Guthix. The stone in that cave is the only substance that can catch the Tears of Guthix.~|~translationMissing
Mine some stone from that cave, make it into a bowl, and bring it to me, and then I will let you catch the Tears.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I don't really have one.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Maybe you should come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
A story?~|~translationMissing
I have been waiting here three thousand years, guarding the Tears of Guthix. I serve my master faithfully, but I am bored.~|~translationMissing
An adventurer such as yourself must have many tales to tell. If you can entertain me, I will let you into the cave for a time.~|~translationMissing
The more I enjoy your story, the more time I will give you in the cave.~|~translationMissing
Then you can drink of the power of balance, which will make you stronger in whatever area you are weakest.~|~translationMissing
What are the Tears of Guthix?~|~translationMissing
The Third Age of the world was a time of great conflict, of destruction never seen before or since, when all the gods save Guthix warred for control.~|~translationMissing
The colossal Wyrms, of whom today's dragons are a pale reflection, turned all the sky to fire, while on the ground armies of foot soldiers, goblins and trolls and humans, filled the valleys and plains with blood.~|~translationMissing
In time the noise of the conflict woke Guthix from His deep slumber, and He rose and stood in the centre of the battlefield so that the splendour of His wrath filled the world, and He called for the conflict to cease!~|~translationMissing
Silence fell, for the gods knew that none could challenge the power of the mighty Guthix -- for His power is that of nature itself, to which all other things are subject, in the end.~|~translationMissing
Guthix reclaimed that which had been stolen from Him, and went back underground to return to His sleep and continue to draw the world's power into Himself.~|~translationMissing
And so great was His sorrow, and so great was His life- giving power, that the rocks themselves began to weep with Him.~|~translationMissing
Later, Guthix noticed that the rocks continued to weep, and that their tears were infused with a small part of His power.~|~translationMissing
So He set me, His servant, to guard the cave, and He entrusted to me the task of judging who was and was not worthy to access the tears.~|~translationMissing
Not now~|~translationMissing
You tell me a story.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Tears of Guthix~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Tears of Guthix.~|~translationMissing

... So I suppose it was my fault that the young members of the Myreque were killed by Vanstrom.~|~translationMissing

... and once I had gathered all the herbs, Trufitus Shakaya was able to commune with his gods.~|~translationMissing
(If A Kingdom Divided is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 75~|~translationMissing
... and that's how Kourend came to be ruled by a king again. It just wasn't quite the king we initially expected.~|~translationMissing
(If King's Ransom is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 76~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 81~|~translationMissing
... So Sigmund was dismissed, and the duke and ruler of the cave goblins signed a peace treaty.~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 82~|~translationMissing
... so I defeated my mirror image, won the respect of the Moon Clan and persuaded them to communicate with the Fremenniks!~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 83~|~translationMissing
... while Snowflake and My Arm live happily together in Weiss.~|~translationMissing
(If Making History is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 84~|~translationMissing
... so that's how the Outpost was saved and converted into a museum.~|~translationMissing

(If Misthalin Mystery is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 86~|~translationMissing
... but I was able to stab the killer with her own knife!~|~translationMissing
A masked killer slashing vulnerable young people in a deserted mansion? Is that what stories have become in this day and age? How formulaic!~|~translationMissing
(If Monk's Friend is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 87~|~translationMissing
... and the monks threw a big birthday party for the child, with lots of wine.~|~translationMissing
I hope they supplied something more suitable for the child to drink.~|~translationMissing

(If Mountain Daughter is completed~|~translationMissing

The names of trolls never cease to amaze me.~|~translationMissing
(If Nature Spirit is complete (first of two possible options)~|~translationMissing

That is a fitting reward for a dedicated servant of Guthix. Thank you for helping him.~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 96~|~translationMissing
... So that was how I helped Filliman Tarlock transform into a Nature Spirit.~|~translationMissing
It is good that you have helped a servant of Guthix to his rest.~|~translationMissing
(If A Night at the Theatre is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 97~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 102~|~translationMissing

(If Rag and Bone Man I is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 108~|~translationMissing
... So I fetched all the bones the Odd Old Man wanted, and he gave me a reward!~|~translationMissing
What could that man have wanted all those bones for? Collecting that many bones cannot be a balanced activity.~|~translationMissing
(If Rag and Bone Man II is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 109~|~translationMissing
... So I fetched all the bones on the old man's wish-list, as well as the ones I'd brought him earlier.~|~translationMissing
(If Ratcatchers is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 110~|~translationMissing
... Those rat-catchers are odd people. But by the end of it I had caught a huge number of rats all over Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
Rats are a highly unbalanced creature and it is right that their numbers be controlled.~|~translationMissing
(If Recipe for Disaster is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 111~|~translationMissing
... So after I had freed all the dinner guests I was finally able to face the Culinaromancer and put an end to his mad schemes!~|~translationMissing
That evil wizard's time spells sent a ripple through the fabric of balance. I am glad he is no longer at large!~|~translationMissing
(If Recruitment Drive is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 112~|~translationMissing
... So I figured out their weird puzzles, and the Temple Knights asked me to join as an initiate member!~|~translationMissing

... I returned to tell King Lathas that the assassination was successful, and he rewarded me.~|~translationMissing
(If The Restless Ghost is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 114~|~translationMissing

(If Romeo & Juliet is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 115~|~translationMissing
... I gave the message to Romeo, but he misunderstood, so they never were together.~|~translationMissing
Never was a story of more woeThat this of Juliet and her Romeo.~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 116~|~translationMissing
... and when I planted the shard, it grew into a crystal tree!~|~translationMissing
(If Royal Trouble is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 117~|~translationMissing
... So I showed that the war was based on a misunderstanding, and now Miscellania and Etceteria were at peace again!~|~translationMissing
War? What is it good for?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely nothing!~|~translationMissing
(If Rum Deal is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 118~|~translationMissing

Drunken zombie pirates? What is the world coming to?~|~translationMissing
(If Rune Mysteries is completed~|~translationMissing

... I would never have thought that three scorpions would take that long to find!~|~translationMissing

(If Shadow of the Storm is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 124~|~translationMissing
... So Denath was Agrith-Naar all along! But I managed to summon the demon again and slay him.~|~translationMissing
Agrith-Naar was one of the demons my master banished at the end of the great war. It seems he found a way to work around the ban on direct intervention.~|~translationMissing
(If Sheep Herder is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 125~|~translationMissing
... and I incinerated the bones of the sheep in the furnace.~|~translationMissing

(If The Slug Menace is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 131~|~translationMissing
... when I told Sir Tiffy that I had accidentally freed the Mother Mallum, he promoted me to the rank of Proselyte within the Temple Knights.~|~translationMissing
That was a strange response to such an unfortunate event. But the motives of the Temple Knights have always been incomprehensibly unbalanced.~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 132~|~translationMissing
... and so the Iorwerth elves were finally defeated and the clan elders restored the city of Prifddinas!~|~translationMissing
(If A Soul's Bane is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 133~|~translationMissing
...So I defeated all the monsters in Tolna's subconscious and he escaped from the rift.~|~translationMissing
The most fearsome monsters are to be found in the darkness of our own minds.~|~translationMissing
(If Spirits of the Elid is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 134~|~translationMissing
... So it turned out that the people of Nardah were dying of thirst because the spirits of the Elid had cursed them for turning away from their goddess.~|~translationMissing
It is a terrible thing for people to turn away from their religion. I think the spirits taught the town a lesson.~|~translationMissing
(If Swan Song is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 135~|~translationMissing
... So the Wise Old Man said it was time for him to retire, and he left the Colony and went home. He gave me loads of XP, but he wouldn't let me have his hat!~|~translationMissing
A hat is just a hat, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Grrr!~|~translationMissing

Bob the Cat? I have heard of that strange creature but have never been able to fathom him. It is no small achievement for you to be able to!~|~translationMissing
If the player has finished Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 140~|~translationMissing

(If Temple of the Eye is completed~|~translationMissing

(If Tower of Life is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 145~|~translationMissing
... and the homunculus now lives in the basement of the Tower, creating living creatures of its own.~|~translationMissing
The alchemists walked a dangerous path when they created that homunculus. I am glad that events ended well for the creature.~|~translationMissing
(If Tree Gnome Village is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 146~|~translationMissing
... and King Bolren thanked me for defeating the warlord and returning the orbs to the gnome people.~|~translationMissing

... and after I had rescued Godric, Dunstan gave me the Law Talisman as a reward!~|~translationMissing

) Dialogue 150~|~translationMissing
... I don't know who put all those traps in the underground pass!~|~translationMissing

... and once the vampyre was dead, the people of Draynor no longer lived in fear.~|~translationMissing
(If Wanted! is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 152~|~translationMissing
... and after I finally managed to track him down, let me tell you, that Solus Dellagar fellow was almost as powerful as he was insane!~|~translationMissing
Yes, it seems he sacrificed his sanity for power. Power often comes with a cost, and the highest cost is often the one you do not immediately see...~|~translationMissing
(If Watchtower is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 153~|~translationMissing
... and with the shield generator working, the ogres could never threaten Yanille again.~|~translationMissing
(If Waterfall Quest is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 154~|~translationMissing
... and that was how I retrieved the treasure from the waterfall.~|~translationMissing
(If What Lies Below is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 155~|~translationMissing
... so King Roald was freed from Surok's spell, and Rat thanked me for all my help.~|~translationMissing
(If Witch's House is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 156~|~translationMissing
... All that trouble just to get a ball out of someone's garden!~|~translationMissing
It is often hard to know how long a task will take when we begin it.~|~translationMissing
(If Witch's Potion is completed~|~translationMissing

... and in the end I managed to solve the clues and find the treasure for Veos.~|~translationMissing
(If Zogre Flesh Eaters is completed~|~translationMissing
) Dialogue 159~|~translationMissing
... Those Zogres were disgusting! But I learned how to fight them with brutal arrows and disease balm.~|~translationMissing
Zombie Ogres!? Some of the foulest creatures of Zamorak. In the great wars the zogre armies could repel the forces of Saradomin with their stench alone!~|~translationMissing
Before you can collect the Tears of Guthix you must make a bowl out of the stone in the cave on the south of the chasm.~|~translationMissing
But I don't know how to reach the cave!~|~translationMissing
I will tell you the story of the light-creatures.~|~translationMissing
Myriad and beautiful were the creatures and civilizations of the early ages of the world. Gielinor was a work of art, shaped lovingly over the millennia by the creative mind of Guthix.~|~translationMissing
Only the sturdiest races survived the Godwars, and even then only by abandoning their high culture and gearing their societies towards war. Of the more delicate races there is now no trace, and almost no memory.~|~translationMissing
One such race had bodies as fragile as snowflakes, yet they built crystal cities that stood for a thousand years.~|~translationMissing
The wind would whisper through the spires and fill them with sweet harmonies, and the rising sun would shine through the precious gems that studded the towers and create inter plays of light as if rainbows were dancing.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, so marvellous was this light-show at its height that the patterns of light themselves became alive, and great flocks of luminous creatures rode along the gem- cast beams, each drawn to its own colour.~|~translationMissing
The creatures you see floating in this chasm are the last sorry remnants of that age. I do not know how they made their way here and survived to this time, but I am grateful for their company.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you should use it with a chisel, rather than with my face.~|~translationMissing
I have a bowl.~|~translationMissing
I will keep your bowl for you, so that you may collect the tears many times in the future.~|~translationMissing
Now... tell me another story, and I will let you collect the tears for the first time.~|~translationMissing

Why can't you get it yourself?~|~translationMissing
The guardians of the Staff of Armadyl fear me!~|~translationMissing
They have set up a magical barrier which even my power cannot overcome!~|~translationMissing
That sounds like a laugh!~|~translationMissing
It's not as easy as it sounds. The monster can only be killed with a weapon of ice. There are many other dangers.~|~translationMissing
I'm up for it!~|~translationMissing
I shall give you a pendant. Without it you will not be able to enter the Chamber of Fear.~|~translationMissing
Here is my pendant. Now, I cannot stay here much longer. Meet me in my house, across the river south- east from Edgeville. It is next to the so-called Grand Exchange.~|~translationMissing
Temple of Ikov~|~translationMissing
Oh no! Sounds far too dangerous!~|~translationMissing
Wimp! Call yourself a hero?! My daughter is more of a hero than you!~|~translationMissing
Whats the reward?!~|~translationMissing
What's the reward?~|~translationMissing
I see you are the mercenary type.~|~translationMissing
It's a living.~|~translationMissing
I will reward you well if you bring me the staff.~|~translationMissing
Start the Temple of Ikov quest?~|~translationMissing
(Same as above from "That sounds like a laugh!")~|~translationMissing
I'll pass this time.~|~translationMissing
Yep, lots of heros about these days.~|~translationMissing
Well if you see any be sure to point them in my direction.~|~translationMissing
I told you not to meet me here again! Soon I will go to my house, across the river south-east from Edgeville. It is next to the so-called Grand Exchange.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the pendant~|~translationMissing
I've lost the pendant you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Imbecile!~|~translationMissing
Lucien has given you another pendant!~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the pendant~|~translationMissing
Sorry! Can you remind me of my mission?~|~translationMissing
My patience grows thin hero!~|~translationMissing
I need the Staff of Armadyl. It's in the Temple of Ikov, near Hemenster, north east of here.~|~translationMissing
It's a bit dark down here! You decide not to venture far.~|~translationMissing
The door won't open!~|~translationMissing
The bridge gives way under your weight!~|~translationMissing
Ow! Hot! Hot!~|~translationMissing
The player is dealt 20 damage.~|~translationMissing
Good thing that lava was shallow!~|~translationMissing
You fit the lever into the bracket.~|~translationMissing
You hear the clunking of some hidden machinery.~|~translationMissing
You find a trap on the lever! You disable the trap.~|~translationMissing
If the chest has arrows~|~translationMissing
You found some ice arrows!~|~translationMissing
If the chest is empty~|~translationMissing
Fire Warrior of Lesarkus spawns.~|~translationMissing
Fire Warrior of Lesarkus~|~translationMissing
You will not pass!~|~translationMissing
Amitus! Setitii!~|~translationMissing
The Fire Warrior casts fire bolt and knocks the player back from the door.~|~translationMissing
You try to open the trapdoor but it won't budge! It looks like the trapdoor can only be opened from the other side.~|~translationMissing
Who dares to enter the Temple of Ikov!~|~translationMissing
A mighty hero!~|~translationMissing
Pathetic fool! Prepare to die!~|~translationMissing
The Fire Warrior attacks.~|~translationMissing
A humble pilgrim.~|~translationMissing
I haven't seen a pilgrim for thousands of years!~|~translationMissing
Temple is closed!~|~translationMissing
Your puny weapons do nothing against me human! Come back when you can give me a real fight!~|~translationMissing
Winelda~|~translationMissing
Hehe! We see you're in a pickle!~|~translationMissing
Wants to be getting over the nasty lava do we?~|~translationMissing
Nah, not bothered!~|~translationMissing
Hehe! Ye'll come back! They always come back!~|~translationMissing
Yes we do!~|~translationMissing
Mocking us are we? Clever one aren't we?~|~translationMissing
I'm knowing some magic trickesses! I could get over easy as that!~|~translationMissing
Don't tell them! They always come! They pester poor Winelda!~|~translationMissing
If you're such a great witch, get me over!~|~translationMissing
See! They pester Winelda!~|~translationMissing
I can do something for you!~|~translationMissing
Good! Don't pester! Help!~|~translationMissing
Get Winelda 20 limpwurt roots for my pot.~|~translationMissing
Then we shows them some magic!~|~translationMissing
Yes I do!~|~translationMissing
Continues above from "I'm knowing some magic trickesses! I could get over easy as that!"~|~translationMissing
If the player has no limpwurt roots~|~translationMissing
Have you got roots for poor Winelda?~|~translationMissing
How many did you need again?~|~translationMissing
We needs 20 Limpwurt roots for pot.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 1-19 limpwurt roots~|~translationMissing
I've got some limpwurt roots!~|~translationMissing
We needs 20 rooteses!~|~translationMissing
If the player has 20 limpwurt roots~|~translationMissing
I've got you the limpwurt roots!~|~translationMissing
Good! Good! My potion is nearly ready! Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble!~|~translationMissing
Now we shows them ours magic! Hold on tight!~|~translationMissing
Winelda takes the limpwurt roots and teleports the player across the lava.~|~translationMissing
Hi again. Could you do the honours again please?~|~translationMissing
Certainly! We helps those that helps poor Winelda!~|~translationMissing
Winelda teleports the player across the lava.~|~translationMissing
Guardian of Armadyl~|~translationMissing
Thou is a foul agent of Lucien! Such an agent must die!~|~translationMissing
The guardian attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
Thou hast ventured deep into the tunnels, you have reached the temple of our master. It is many ages since a pilgrim has come here.~|~translationMissing
I seek the Staff of Armadyl.~|~translationMissing
We are the guardians of the staff, our fathers were guardians and our fathers' fathers before that. Why dost thou seek it?~|~translationMissing
Lucien will give me a grand reward for it!~|~translationMissing
Thou art working for that spawn of evil?! Fool! You must be cleansed to save your soul!~|~translationMissing
How dare you call me a fool!~|~translationMissing
How dare you call me a fool! I will work for whom I want!~|~translationMissing
We must cleanse the temple!~|~translationMissing
I just thought of something I must do!~|~translationMissing
An agent of evil cannot be allowed to leave!~|~translationMissing
You're right, it's time for my yearly bath.~|~translationMissing
The guardian splashes holy water over you.~|~translationMissing
You have been cleansed!~|~translationMissing
Lucien must not get hold of the staff! He would become too powerful!~|~translationMissing
Hast thou come across the undead necromancer? It was he that raised an army of the undead against Varrock a generation ago. If you know where he is you can help us defeat him.~|~translationMissing
Ok! I'll help!~|~translationMissing
So he is close by?~|~translationMissing
He must be gaining in power again. If you can defeat him he will be banished from this plane for a while. You will need this pendant to attack him.~|~translationMissing
The guardian has given you a pendant.~|~translationMissing
No! I shall not turn against my employer!~|~translationMissing
Fool! You will die for your sins!~|~translationMissing
I need time to think.~|~translationMissing
Linger a while and be at peace.~|~translationMissing
Give it to me!~|~translationMissing
The staff is sacred! You will not have it!~|~translationMissing
I collect rare and powerful artefacts.~|~translationMissing
Your worldly greed has darkened your soul!~|~translationMissing
Out of my way fool!~|~translationMissing
I may be a fool but I will not step aside!~|~translationMissing
Why not?!~|~translationMissing
Only members of our order are allowed to handle the staff.~|~translationMissing
Then you must die!~|~translationMissing
You're right, I will go now.~|~translationMissing
That is a wise decision. Stay a while and let your soul be cleansed!~|~translationMissing
What are your kind and what are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
We are the Guardians of Armadyl. We have kept the temple safe for many ages. The evil in the dungeons seek what lies here. The Mahjarrat are the worst.~|~translationMissing
What is the Armadyl?~|~translationMissing
Armadyl is the god we serve. We have been charged with guarding his sacred arctifacts until he requires them.~|~translationMissing
Ah ok, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Go in peace.~|~translationMissing
Someone told me there were only three gods.~|~translationMissing
Someone told me there were only three gods. Saradomin, Zamorak and Guthix.~|~translationMissing
Saradominists. Bleh. They only acknowledge those three. There are at least twenty gods!~|~translationMissing
Who are the Mahjarrat?~|~translationMissing
They are ancient and powerful beings! They are very evil! It is said that they once dominated this plane of existence, Zamorak was supposedly of their blood. They are far fewer in number now.~|~translationMissing
Some still have presence in this world in their liche forms. Mahjarrat such as Lucien and Azzanadra would become very powerful if they came into possession of the Staff of Armadyl.~|~translationMissing
Did you say Lucien?~|~translationMissing
Did you say Lucien? It was Lucien that asked me to get the staff!~|~translationMissing
You are a fool to be working for Lucien! Your soul must be cleansed to save you!~|~translationMissing
I hope you're doing a good job then!~|~translationMissing
Do not fear! We are devoted to our charge!~|~translationMissing
Wow! You must be really old!~|~translationMissing
No! I am not old! My family has guarded the staff for many generations.~|~translationMissing
Have you killed Lucien?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the Armadyl pendant~|~translationMissing
Not yet, I've lost the pendant you gave me!~|~translationMissing
Hurry friend! Time is against us!~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the Armadyl pendant~|~translationMissing
You decide not to steal the staff as you have agreed to help the Guardians.~|~translationMissing
That is not thine to take!~|~translationMissing
Have you got the Staff of Armadyl yet?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the staff~|~translationMissing
If the player has the staff~|~translationMissing
Yes! Here it is.~|~translationMissing
You give Lucien the Staff of Armadyl.~|~translationMissing
Muhahahhahahaha!~|~translationMissing
I can feel the power of the staff running through me! I will be more powerful and they shall bow down to me!~|~translationMissing
I suppose you want your reward? I shall grant you much power!~|~translationMissing
You don't want to attack me. I am your friend.~|~translationMissing
Lucien waves his hand.~|~translationMissing
You decide not to attack Lucien. He is your friend.~|~translationMissing
You have defeated me for now! I shall reappear in the North!~|~translationMissing

6.2 Mage of Zamorak~|~translationMissing
What? You haven't heard of me? The great Mia Persten of the Order of Wizards? The leading researcher in teleportation magic? The creator of the Home Teleport spell?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. I'm [player name].~|~translationMissing
No offence taken! My research tends to take me far from the Wizards' Tower. I've been all across Gielinor and even to some other planes of existence!~|~translationMissing
Other planes of existence? Sounds exciting!~|~translationMissing
Exciting and terrifying! Brilliant, right?~|~translationMissing
So what are you doing in Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
See you around.~|~translationMissing
What's a wizard doing in Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
If the player already asked "Who are you?"~|~translationMissing
Should I not be in Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
Er... good question. I guess I just haven't seen a wizard around here before.~|~translationMissing
Well, maybe you should start expecting the unexpected! That way you can spend less time worrying about why I'm here, and more time asking life's real questions.~|~translationMissing
If the player did not ask "Who are you?"~|~translationMissing
Why shouldn't a wizard be in Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
Well for a start, I'm not just any wizard. The name's Mia Persten. I'm the leading researcher in teleportation magic for the Order of Wizards.~|~translationMissing
Pleased to meet you. I'm [player name].~|~translationMissing
Now as for your question, maybe you should start expecting the unexpected! That way you can spend less time worrying about why I'm here, and more time asking life's real questions.~|~translationMissing
Right... and what kind of questions are you referring to?~|~translationMissing
Well, that's the thing. It's different for everyone! Why do trees grow from stumps substantially faster than from seeds? Where do meteorites come from? Why do we have to hold our arms out to teleport successfully?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. What are the answers?~|~translationMissing
I don't know either!~|~translationMissing
So you're in Al Kharid to work out how trees grow?~|~translationMissing
No, silly! I came here to buy something.~|~translationMissing
Something?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 10 Runecraft~|~translationMissing
That's right! Something! Tell me, what do you know of runecrafting?~|~translationMissing
Not a lot really.~|~translationMissing
A shame. Unfortunately, this something requires some understanding in that area.~|~translationMissing
You do not meet all of the requirements to start the Temple of the Eye quest.~|~translationMissing
That's right! Something! Tell me, what do you know of the Abyss?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Enter the Abyss~|~translationMissing
A shame. Unfortunately, this something requires somewhat of an abyssal understanding.~|~translationMissing
The Abyss? I know all about the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
Really? It's quite unusual for an adventurer like yourself to have knowledge in that area.~|~translationMissing
Well I recently helped a group of Zamorakian wizards gain access to the Rune Essence Mine. In return, they gave me access to the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
Zamorakian wizards? You do realise that the Z.M.I. are enemies to the Order of Wizards, right?~|~translationMissing
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that...~|~translationMissing
Oh, don't worry about it. The Order of Wizards may be a Saradominist group, but I've never personally had much time for gods. I prefer knowledge to religion.~|~translationMissing
Still, it's maybe best you don't tell anyone else. I can't imagine my fellow wizards will be happy to know that you gave away details on their secret mine.~|~translationMissing
Enough about them though. You've just shared quite the revelation with me! Is it really true that the Z.M.I. have found a way to access the Abyss?~|~translationMissing
Well in that case, I think you might be the perfect person to aid me in a little task.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed One Small Favour~|~translationMissing
A little task? This sounds like the time someone asked me for one small favour. I'm not sure if I'm ready for that again.~|~translationMissing
Oh, don't be silly! This will be fun!~|~translationMissing
Alright, what kind of task is it?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed One Small Favour~|~translationMissing
What kind of task?~|~translationMissing
Well I can't go telling you that until you agree, can I? Wouldn't want you sharing my secrets.~|~translationMissing
You're not giving me much to go on here.~|~translationMissing
There'll be quite the reward for you at the end!~|~translationMissing
I'd rather not get involved.~|~translationMissing
That's a shame. Well, you just let me know if you reconsider.~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Have you changed your mind about helping me with that little task?~|~translationMissing
Alright, what do you need from me?~|~translationMissing
You'll help? Great! Well first, a question for you~|~translationMissing
you say the Z.M.I. have gained access to the Abyss? By any chance, are they using it to gain quick access to the runic altars for runecrafting purposes?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but how did you...~|~translationMissing
I knew it! I've been wondering for some time how they've been creating so many runes. I'd never considered that they'd somehow gained access to the Abyss, but I now realise it was the obvious explanation.~|~translationMissing
So is that what you're after? You want access to the Abyss as well?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, but actually, no. It seems we've jumped ahead a bit. Let's go back to why I'm here.~|~translationMissing
The 'something' you bought?~|~translationMissing
The 'something' I bought! Here, take a look.~|~translationMissing
Persten shows you an amulet.~|~translationMissing
A foolish archaeologist by the name of Asgarnia Smith recently found this washed up near the Ruins of Uzer. Despite his apparent archaeological credentials, he dismissed it as junk.~|~translationMissing
Luckily, I was able to buy it from him before he disposed of it. Can you believe he thought the 100 coins I paid was too much? If only he knew the true value of something like this...~|~translationMissing
Why is it so valuable?~|~translationMissing
You see that eye on it? That is the symbol of both the Order of Wizards and our home, the Wizards' Tower. Thing is, that's only the start.~|~translationMissing
From what I can tell, this amulet is thousands of years old, but our order was only formed at the dawn of the Fifth Age. That wasn't even two hundred years ago!~|~translationMissing
But how...~|~translationMissing
Hang on! I'm not done yet. I also inspected the amulet for magical energies and found something fascinating! I recognised two distinct magical signatures.~|~translationMissing
The first is the same magic found in rune essence. That's already pretty exciting, but it's the second that will blow your mind!~|~translationMissing
I'm getting to that! My, you do like interrupting, don't you? Don't worry, I understand. I get quite excited about these things as well!~|~translationMissing
Anyway, here's the big reveal for you~|~translationMissing
the second signature was energy from the Abyss!~|~translationMissing
So you have an amulet with the symbol of your order on it, but it predates your order by thousands of years?~|~translationMissing
It also turned up miles from where your order is based, and is filled with energy from a dimension that until recently, no one had even been to?~|~translationMissing
Now you see why this is so exciting!~|~translationMissing
So what do you need from me?~|~translationMissing
I need to find out where this amulet came from. It should be possible to trace it using the abyssal energy it still contains.~|~translationMissing
This is where you ask 'What's the catch?'~|~translationMissing
*sigh* What's the catch?~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you asked, [player name]! Unfortunately, the spell needed to trace the amulet will only work properly from inside the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
Oh I see where this is going. You don't have access to the Abyss, but I do.~|~translationMissing
Precisely! While I don't care about the religious squabbling between the Z.M.I. and my order, I still can't see them wanting to work with me any time soon.~|~translationMissing
So I need to take this amulet to the Abyss and work out where it came from?~|~translationMissing
Correct! I imagine you'll need the help of your Z.M.I. friends.~|~translationMissing
Just maybe don't tell them who gave it to you.~|~translationMissing
I'll visit the Mage of Zamorak in Varrock. He should be able to help me.~|~translationMissing
Return to me once you are done. Oh, and don't forget the amulet!~|~translationMissing
Persten hands you the amulet.~|~translationMissing
Persten tries to hand you the amulet, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Here, take this amulet to your Z.M.I. friend in Varrock. Hopefully he can tell us where it came from.~|~translationMissing
Persten hands you an amulet.~|~translationMissing
Persten tries to hand you an amulet, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Any luck with that amulet?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the amulet~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I lost it.~|~translationMissing
You lost a one of a kind ancient artefact?~|~translationMissing
Well, good job I found it again. Here you go. Take it to your Z.M.I. friend in Varrock. Hopefully he can tell us where it came from.~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the amulet~|~translationMissing
You should take it to your Z.M.I. friend in Varrock. Hopefully he can tell us where it came from.~|~translationMissing
Mage of Zamorak~|~translationMissing
Ah, you again. What do you want?~|~translationMissing
I need your help with an amulet.~|~translationMissing
An amulet? What amulet?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the amulet~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't actually have it with me. I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
You show the amulet to the Mage of Zamorak.~|~translationMissing
That eye on it... That is the symbol of the Order of Wizards. What's all this about?~|~translationMissing
The amulet is giving off abyssal energy. I was hoping you could help me work out where it came from.~|~translationMissing
Why should I?~|~translationMissing
Well I did help you gain access to the Rune Essence Mine.~|~translationMissing
And we gave you knowledge on the Abyss in return. We owe you no further favours.~|~translationMissing
Are you not even slightly curious about how an amulet with the symbol of the Order of Wizards on it is giving off abyssal energy? After all, they don't have access to the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
I hope you're not about to tell me that you shared our secrets with the Saradominists?~|~translationMissing
Of course not.~|~translationMissing
Then where did you get the amulet?~|~translationMissing
I... bought it from an archaeologist.~|~translationMissing
There's something off about all of this. Show it to me again.~|~translationMissing
You show the amulet to the Mage of Zamorak again. As you do, he casts a spell upon it.~|~translationMissing
Just a spell to tell me more about it. It seems this amulet is very unusual.~|~translationMissing
So you'll help?~|~translationMissing
Very well, but first you must do something for me. Bring me a bucket of water and a strong cup of tea.~|~translationMissing
A strong cup of tea?~|~translationMissing
That's right. The tea seller just north east of here can give you one. He owes me, in fact, so just tell him Herbert sent you.~|~translationMissing
Wait... Your name is Herbert?~|~translationMissing
I guess not. I just never had you down as a Herbert.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you tell me more about the Abyss?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you tell me more about your group?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Nothing. I'm just looking around.~|~translationMissing
Zamorak~|~translationMissing
Could you help me with that amulet now?~|~translationMissing
Do you have a bucket of water and a strong cup of tea?~|~translationMissing
I will not help you until you bring them to me. The tea seller just north east of here can give you a strong cup of tea. Just tell him Herbert sent you.~|~translationMissing
Tea Seller~|~translationMissing
Greetings! Are you in need of refreshment?~|~translationMissing
Could I have a strong cup of tea?~|~translationMissing
A strong cup of tea? What do you mean?~|~translationMissing
Herbert sent me for one.~|~translationMissing
Ah, well why didn't you say that? Between you and me, Herbert's strong cups of tea are actually just my regular cups of tea, but if it makes him happy...~|~translationMissing
The Tea Seller hands you a strong cup of tea.~|~translationMissing
I hope Herbert enjoys it.~|~translationMissing
The Tea Seller tries to hand you a strong cup of tea, but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
For Herbert? I already gave you one for him.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the strong cup of tea~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but I need another.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... alright, but I can't keep making these for free you know.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the strong cup of tea~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, how silly of me.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a bucket of water and a strong cup of tea~|~translationMissing
I will not help you until you bring them to me.~|~translationMissing
The Mage of Zamorak takes the strong cup of tea from you and immediately drinks it.~|~translationMissing
Aaah, nothing like a nice cuppa tea!~|~translationMissing
Right, a deal is a deal, but the spell to determine the origin of that amulet will only work from the Abyss, so you'll need to have the initiate there perform it for you.~|~translationMissing
Meet me in the Wilderness when you're ready to be teleported there.~|~translationMissing
Can't you just teleport me from here?~|~translationMissing
From the middle of Varrock? What if someone is watching?~|~translationMissing
If someone was watching, they'd know you have a secret Chaos Temple here in Varrock. I reckon you're pretty safe.~|~translationMissing
Fine, but don't expect me to make a habit of this. I will offer you a single teleport from here directly to the initiate in the Abyss. Make sure you are definitely ready.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... what was the bucket of water for?~|~translationMissing
Ah, that. While time passes slower in the Abyss, the initiate maintaining the rift has still been there for quite a while. He needs a good bath.~|~translationMissing
So you just want me to throw it over him?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. Now, are you ready to be teleported? Don't forget, this is a one-time offer. In future, you'll need to meet me in the Wilderness to access the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the eye amulet~|~translationMissing
I should probably get the amulet first.~|~translationMissing
That would be wise.~|~translationMissing
Teleport to the Abyss? You can only teleport from here once.~|~translationMissing
Veniens! Sallakar! Rinnesset!~|~translationMissing
The player is brought to the centre of the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
I'm not ready yet.~|~translationMissing
Well then return to me when you are, but try not to waste too much of my time.~|~translationMissing
The spell to determine the origin of that amulet will only work from the Abyss, so you'll need to have the initiate there perform it for you.~|~translationMissing
Are you ready to be teleported there? Don't forget, this is a one-time offer. In future, you'll need to meet me in the Wilderness to access the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the bucket of water~|~translationMissing
I should probably get that bucket of water first.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the eye necklace and a bucket of water~|~translationMissing
I already gave you your one-time teleport to the Abyss from here, so you'll need to meet me in the Wilderness if you want teleporting there.~|~translationMissing
Dark Mage~|~translationMissing
Quiet! You must not break my concentration!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Why not?~|~translationMissing
Amulet?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the amulet~|~translationMissing
Yes, but I don't seem to have it with me. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
What? Are you trying to waste my time?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a bucket of water~|~translationMissing
Yes, but I also need to go and get a bucket of water.~|~translationMissing
Oh, hang on. Someone is trying to contact me...~|~translationMissing
The Dark Mage suddenly starts talking to someone else.~|~translationMissing
What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?~|~translationMissing
Fine. A simple transfiguration spell should resolve things for you.~|~translationMissing
Now can you leave me alone? I can't keep affording these distractions!~|~translationMissing
The Dark Mage turns back to you.~|~translationMissing
What did you want? Something about an amulet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but first...~|~translationMissing
You throw the bucket of water over the Dark Mage.~|~translationMissing
What in the actual...~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but Herbert said you needed a wash.~|~translationMissing
Are you serious? What if I'd lost concentration and let this rift collapse? Do you like having a brain that isn't made of mush? Because mush is all that would have been left!~|~translationMissing
I like my brain how it is, thanks. Now, could you help me?~|~translationMissing
Why should I? I'm soaked thanks to you!~|~translationMissing
Herbert said you would.~|~translationMissing
Of course he did! Alright then, what do you want?~|~translationMissing
This amulet is giving off abyssal energy. I need you to cast a spell to tell me where it came from.~|~translationMissing
Let's have a look then.~|~translationMissing
You show the amulet to the Dark Mage.~|~translationMissing
Right, just give me a moment.~|~translationMissing
The Dark Mage casts a spell on the amulet.~|~translationMissing
Okay, this spell will allow me to triangulate the origin of the amulet. To make things easier, I'm using this rift to compare energy from that origin with energy from the runic altars.~|~translationMissing
Of course, thanks to the ways time and space work in this place, the information won't necessarily come in the right order.~|~translationMissing
Meaning I'll need you to help, you fool! You see that energy that's just emerged from the rift? Work out which order it goes in!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I need your help with something.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Sorry, I'll go.~|~translationMissing
It seems I don't have it with me. I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
What? Don't waste my time!~|~translationMissing
What do I need to do with this energy?~|~translationMissing
Work out which order it goes in!~|~translationMissing
I've worked out which order the energy goes in.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I can see that. Now, hang on.~|~translationMissing
The Dark Mage pauses for a moment, as if lost in thought. He then hastily pulls out a scroll and scribbles something on it.~|~translationMissing
I've noted the details on this scroll. A competent enough wizard should be able to use it to cast a teleportation spell to take you right there.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me anything about the place?~|~translationMissing
With all the time I've spent here, I'd like to consider myself an expert on the Abyss, but there's something very strange about the place this amulet came from.~|~translationMissing
Strange how?~|~translationMissing
Well if I knew that, it wouldn't be strange, would it? Now, if you're done bothering me, I need to stay focused on this rift!~|~translationMissing
The Dark Mage hands you an incantation.~|~translationMissing
About that incantation...~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the incantation~|~translationMissing
Oh the things I would do to you if I wasn't maintaining this rift! Here, take this you fool!~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the incantation~|~translationMissing
Er... Nothing.~|~translationMissing
Nothing! Would you leave me alone!~|~translationMissing
Oh, he already did that.~|~translationMissing
Then why are you talking to me? You have what you need.~|~translationMissing
Yes! I have an incantation that could lead us to wherever it came from.~|~translationMissing
Brilliant! Let's have a look.~|~translationMissing
You show the incantation to Persten and she quickly makes a copy for herself.~|~translationMissing
Oh, fascinating! Hmm... But that would mean...~|~translationMissing
That would mean what?~|~translationMissing
Shhh! I'm thinking.~|~translationMissing
Yes... Two... no three more! Silly me! Counted myself didn't I.~|~translationMissing
Well it should be fine. I can't see them saying no. After all, it's their symbol as well...~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, you're here! Brilliant! You'll be pleased to know that I've worked out what we must do next.~|~translationMissing
Patience, young adventurer. Before we get to that, let me share with you my theory on where this amulet came from.~|~translationMissing
While you were gone, I was thinking about why the amulet would have magical energy from both rune essence and the Abyss. All of a sudden, it hit me!~|~translationMissing
Ouch?~|~translationMissing
Quite the opposite! The source of this amulet must be an ancient teleportation matrix to the runic altars, just like the one the Z.M.I. have in the Abyss!~|~translationMissing
This is good news, in case you were wondering! Access to a teleportation matrix like that will be life changing when it comes to my work!~|~translationMissing
Of course, the rest of my order will be very happy as well. It'll completely remove the advantage the Z.M.I. currently have. Now there's a balance that Guthix himself would love!~|~translationMissing
Ah, but this talk of the Z.M.I. has reminded me of something. Could I have that amulet back?~|~translationMissing
You give the amulet back to Persten.~|~translationMissing
Ah, but this talk of the Z.M.I. has reminded me of something. You lost that amulet didn't you?~|~translationMissing
Maybe...~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I found it for you. I'll keep hold of it for now.~|~translationMissing
Now, just give me a moment...~|~translationMissing
Persten casts a spell on the amulet.~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes. Well, that's not surprising.~|~translationMissing
Your Z.M.I. friends cast a transmission spell on the amulet. Had we taken it with us, it would have transmitted all sorts of information back to them about the origin.~|~translationMissing
It's not a problem. I suspected they might do something like this. The good news is that this means they have no intention of using that incantation themselves.~|~translationMissing
Again, as expected. They prefer to lurk in the shadows. To be honest, I totally understand. I've been known to do the same from time to time.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I've modified their spell to send false information to them. They'll be none the wiser.~|~translationMissing
I thought you didn't care about religion? Why don't you want the Z.M.I. getting that information?~|~translationMissing
Oh, my friend, you misunderstand. I have no issues with the Z.M.I. having the information, but I don't want them getting it before I've even had a chance to determine what it is!~|~translationMissing
I see. So what now?~|~translationMissing
Yes, back to business! The incantation is quite complex, so we will need the help of three other wizards to perform it. I'm afraid I'm not including you in that, although you are very talented!~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I think... so where do we get these other wizards?~|~translationMissing
From the Wizards' Tower of course! My fellow wizards won't be able to resist getting their hands on a teleportation matrix, especially one that may be connected to the history of our order!~|~translationMissing
Now, you head to the Wizards' Tower and show that incantation to Sedridor. I have a couple of things to prepare first, but I will join you there soon.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and whatever you do, don't mention the Z.M.I. while you're there.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll see you soon.~|~translationMissing
Hey, if you want, I can teleport you to the Wizards' Tower. Consider it a one-time gift from me.~|~translationMissing
Teleport to the Wizards' Tower? You can only use this teleport once.~|~translationMissing
The player is telported to the entrance of the Wizards' Tower.~|~translationMissing
I think I'll walk.~|~translationMissing
Well let me know if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Did you take that incantation to Sedridor?~|~translationMissing
I may have lost it.~|~translationMissing
No matter, I can give you a copy of mine. Try not to lose it this time!~|~translationMissing
Persten hands you a copy of the incantation.~|~translationMissing
Now quickly! Time is of the essence! If you want, I can teleport you to the Wizards' Tower. Consider it a one-time gift from me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the incantation~|~translationMissing
Well hurry up! If you want, I can teleport you to the Wizards' Tower. Consider it a one-time gift from me.~|~translationMissing
Now quickly! Time is of the essence!~|~translationMissing
Well hurry up! This could be the biggest discovery of our lifetimes!~|~translationMissing
I need your help with an incantation.~|~translationMissing
An incantation, hmm? What incantation?~|~translationMissing
A teleport that could potentially take us to an ancient teleportation matrix. Persten reckons you might be able to use it to gain easier access to the runic altars.~|~translationMissing
Wait... Persten sent you?~|~translationMissing
That's right. Oh, I should also mention that this teleportation matrix seems to have some connection to your order, despite predating it by thousands of years.~|~translationMissing
So Persten disappears for all this time, and then shows up again with knowledge on an ancient teleportation matrix? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. It's probably not the strangest thing she's done.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, what do you need my help with exactly?~|~translationMissing
Persten needs three other wizards to be able to perform the incantation.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... can I see it?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the incantation~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't have it with me.~|~translationMissing
I'd very much like to see it. Come back to me when you have it.~|~translationMissing
You give the incantation to Sedridor.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... this scroll is very interesting. Did you get it from a Zamorakian wizard, perhaps? Don't lie to me, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Well since you asked... I... well...~|~translationMissing
It's clear from your response that my suspicions are correct. This incantation is written on very thin flesh rather than parchment, a horrific practice only used by Zamorakians.~|~translationMissing
Need I remind you that it was the Zamorakians who burnt down the first Wizards' Tower?~|~translationMissing
[player name], I'm going to be frank with you. Persten hasn't been seen here for almost a year. My last meeting with her was to discuss changing her line of study due to her lack of results.~|~translationMissing
She was given one more year to produce something of note. Now, with time almost up, she sends you here with Zamorakian incantations and odd claims about an ancient teleportation matrix.~|~translationMissing
But what if it's true? That teleportation matrix could change everything!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I admit we went to some Zamorakians for help with the incantation, but they've had no other involvement. Persten has even made sure they won't get anything beneficial out of this.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... You have been a great help to us in the past. For that, I will consider it. First though, I will do a thorough arcane analysis of this incantation to determine if it is safe to cast.~|~translationMissing
Now, as for your three wizards, I can't be wasting the others' time with this sort of thing, especially when I haven't even agreed to allow it yet.~|~translationMissing
However, Traiborn has three new apprentices who could help. This might be a good learning opportunity for them. Speak to him while I inspect this incantation.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Who else knows the teleport to the Rune Essence Mine?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Could you tell me about the old Wizards' Tower?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Nothing thanks, I'm just looking around.~|~translationMissing
Can you help me with that incantation?~|~translationMissing
I haven't finished my analysis of it yet. While you wait, I suggest you speak with Traiborn. He has three new apprentices who could help you, assuming I agree to let things go ahead.~|~translationMissing
Apprentice Cordelia~|~translationMissing
Thingummywut. Thin... gummy... what?~|~translationMissing
I'm a little busy trying to solve that mad wizard's puzzle. If you have any questions, ask him instead.~|~translationMissing
So, if that's six and this is eight, then if we multiply... No, divide? No, that's not it either.~|~translationMissing
Oh, didn't see you there! I'm a little busy trying to solve a puzzle set by the great Traiborn. If you have any questions, could you ask him instead?~|~translationMissing
Apprentice Tamara~|~translationMissing
Air and earth? What about water and fire? Is this an elemental problem, or are they completely irrelevant?~|~translationMissing
Oh, didn't see you there. I'm a little busy trying to solve the puzzle Traiborn gave us. If you have any questions, you should ask him instead.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What's a thingummywut?~|~translationMissing
I need your apprentices to help with an incantation.~|~translationMissing
Right now? But we're having a party!~|~translationMissing
A party?~|~translationMissing
Party? What party?~|~translationMissing
You said you were having a party?~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose it is a party of sorts. A study party! Would you like to join in? You look like you could use one!~|~translationMissing
I'll pass... Anyway, Sedridor said your apprentices could help me with an incantation.~|~translationMissing
What kind of incantation?~|~translationMissing
One that could lead us to an ancient teleportation matrix.~|~translationMissing
Teleportation matrix? Doesn't sound like the most comfortable place for a party... I bet it's full of thingummywuts as well!~|~translationMissing
I'm not suggesting we move the party there. I'm suggesting that we cancel the party and discover the secrets of this teleportation matrix instead.~|~translationMissing
Cancel the party? You're certainly a party pooper!~|~translationMissing
Alright, how about instead of cancelling the party, we finish it with a bang? What's currently on the agenda?~|~translationMissing
Finish it with a bang? Sedridor won't be happy if we burn the place down again, will he? Still, I like it!~|~translationMissing
I've currently tasked each of the apprentices with solving a problem. If they all solve it, we can celebrate together!~|~translationMissing
Sounds good. So, what's the problem?~|~translationMissing
Problem? There's no problem! Everything is fine here. We're having a party!~|~translationMissing
I mean what's the problem they have to solve?~|~translationMissing
Oh! It's trivial! They just have to figure out what a thingummywut is!~|~translationMissing
A thingummy... what?~|~translationMissing
Precisely!~|~translationMissing
Right... I'll speak to the apprentices. Perhaps together we can figure this out.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Teach me to be a mighty and powerful wizard.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'd better go.~|~translationMissing
I think I know what a thingummywut is!~|~translationMissing
Oh? Do tell.~|~translationMissing
A slayer creature!~|~translationMissing
A slayer creature? That doesn't make any sense at all! Besides, not even the slayer masters know how to kill a thingummywut!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps my apprentices could teach you a thing or three. You should talk to them.~|~translationMissing
A great wizard, lost to history!~|~translationMissing
Lost to history? That doesn't make any sense at all! Besides, a thingummywut is not lost to history. It's very well documented inside my head!~|~translationMissing
Me? That doesn't make any sense at all! If I were a thingummywut, I wouldn't be stood here teaching!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, how embarrassing. Perhaps my apprentices could teach you a thing or three. You should talk to them.~|~translationMissing
Traiborn said you're trying to solve a puzzle? Maybe I could help?~|~translationMissing
Why? Do you think I need your help to solve this? I'll prove I'm smarter than these two!~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't doubt you're smart enough to solve this on your own. I'd just like to see the puzzle to further my own knowledge and understanding.~|~translationMissing
You think I'll be persuaded that easily? I'm not as easy to fool as the others, but I admire your efforts nonetheless.~|~translationMissing
I'll be honest then. In truth, I don't care about this puzzle at all. I'm actually looking to recruit some talented wizards to help uncover a long-lost teleportation matrix.~|~translationMissing
The hope is to use it to gain easy access to the runic altars for runecrafting purposes.~|~translationMissing
Well that's infinitely more interesting! In that case, why do you care about the puzzle?~|~translationMissing
Traiborn said that he wouldn't give his permission for you to join me until the puzzle is solved, so I thought I'd lend a hand.~|~translationMissing
Very well, you appear to be telling the truth, and I'd rather be uncovering a teleportation matrix than doing this.~|~translationMissing
Could I see that puzzle again?~|~translationMissing
Puzzle interface opens~|~translationMissing
Sounds like you're trying to solve a puzzle. Perhaps I could help?~|~translationMissing
Oh, hey there! Yes, I'm trying to solve a puzzle set by the world-renowned Traiborn himself! It truly is an honour to have someone like him take the time to teach an up-and-coming wizard such as myself.~|~translationMissing
Why do you think so highly of him?~|~translationMissing
Oh, so many reasons! But the biggest is that amongst all of the wizards, he is the foremost expert in extra- planar magic!~|~translationMissing
Why else do you think he has the smallest room in the tower? Because he doesn't need the space! He can just open a portal to create more!~|~translationMissing
I see, and is this the branch of magic you want to specialise in?~|~translationMissing
Oh absolutely! That's why I'm here. I need to solve this puzzle to prove that I'm ready to learn all that he has to teach.~|~translationMissing
Well that's actually not too different to the reason I'm here. I'm currently helping a wizard called Persten, and she seems to be quite knowledgeable on different planes.~|~translationMissing
She's tasked me with recruiting some wizards to help her uncover a teleportation matrix. Would you like to join us?~|~translationMissing
You've met Persten? She studied directly under Traiborn for multiple years! I'd love to meet her, but she's hard to track down. Could you introduce us?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I can do that. We need to solve this puzzle first though. Traiborn won't let you three leave until you do. Perhaps I could help you solve it?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. I wouldn't want Traiborn to think poorly of me if I've cheated and asked for help... but I do want to work with Persten...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll show you the puzzle.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Here you go!~|~translationMissing
What appears to be the problem?~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry! Didn't see you there.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry. What were you muttering about with air and earth? Is it related to the puzzle Traiborn gave you all?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I just can't wrap my head around it. It feels like there are too many unknown variables. Besides, how does all this relate to a thingummywut in the first place? Whatever that actually is.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps it's a slayer creature? Or a person? Is this a logical puzzle, a riddle or a mathematical problem?~|~translationMissing
I see. Perhaps I could take a look and help you out?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure... It sounds like cheating, but I really do want to beat Cordelia. She's always one step ahead of me, so it would be nice to finally win for a change.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm actually here to recruit the three of you to help uncover an old teleportation matrix. The only issue is that Traiborn won't let you leave until the puzzle is solved.~|~translationMissing
Ooh! Did you say a teleportation matrix? Teleportation magic is my specialty! I'd love to help!~|~translationMissing
Well, I'd be glad to have you along! So, will you show me the puzzle?~|~translationMissing
Sure! Just please don't tell the others you helped me.~|~translationMissing
If the input is 11~|~translationMissing
11!~|~translationMissing
Well done! That's correct!~|~translationMissing
See, it's easier to solve problems when you put aside what's best for you and instead focus on what's best for the team!~|~translationMissing
Congratulations, you all pass!~|~translationMissing
But you said that only the first of us to solve it would pass!~|~translationMissing
Oh? Did I? I forgot. Either way, I hope you've all now learnt a valuable lesson in teamwork! You have this adventurer here to thank for that.~|~translationMissing
Wait, but we all had different puzzles written down?~|~translationMissing
Of course! We needed to combine our puzzles to solve it. Wow, that's genius! What a great way to teach us all teamwork!~|~translationMissing
Now, finish with a bang did you say?~|~translationMissing
Traiborn suddenly sets off some fireworks!~|~translationMissing
What the - what was that for?!~|~translationMissing
Well, it was your idea after all. Now why don't you go tell Sedridor that my apprentices are free to help?~|~translationMissing
If the input is any other number~|~translationMissing
[number]!~|~translationMissing
No, that's not right at all. You should think harder about this!~|~translationMissing
So your apprentices can help with the incantation?~|~translationMissing
That's right, young thingummywut. Now, don't keep Sedridor waiting!~|~translationMissing
Traiborn says I'm allowed to help you with this teleportation matrix. You should speak to Sedridor in the basement.~|~translationMissing
I think I'm ready to meet Persten! You should go to the basement and let Sedridor know we're all ready.~|~translationMissing
Traiborn says I'm allowed to help you now. Let's find this teleportation matrix! I think you need to speak to Sedridor in the basement first though.~|~translationMissing
Hello again! Ready to uncover a magical secret that could change the world forever?~|~translationMissing
Slow down, Persten! I am still inspecting this amulet of yours.~|~translationMissing
You're inspecting the amulet now? Does that mean the incantation is safe?~|~translationMissing
That's right! The amulet is as well, of course, but Sedridor here likes to be careful.~|~translationMissing
Not all of us are so carefree when it comes to the rules of our order, Persten. I mean really, Zamorakian incantations! Be glad I've even let you back in the tower!~|~translationMissing
The unfortunate price of progress, Sedridor.~|~translationMissing
I can think of a few other unfortunate things...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, the amulet seems to be safe, and as much as I hate to admit it, your assessment seems to be correct.~|~translationMissing
So we can go ahead?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'm still not happy about this, but we can't throw away this chance. I assume Traiborn's apprentices are ready?~|~translationMissing
Well then what are we waiting for? Let's do this!~|~translationMissing
[player name], are you ready?~|~translationMissing
Let's do it.~|~translationMissing
Incantation cutscene begins below.~|~translationMissing
So we're ready to perform the incantation?~|~translationMissing
It seems so, assuming you are ready yourself?~|~translationMissing
We will be here once you are.~|~translationMissing
Ready to begin the incantation?~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. The three apprentices and Traiborn appear.~|~translationMissing
Everyone ready?~|~translationMissing
We won't let you down, Persten.~|~translationMissing
Alright, with me!~|~translationMissing
Persten and co.~|~translationMissing
Saris! Val! Curak! Belito!~|~translationMissing
A blue portal opens.~|~translationMissing
It worked!~|~translationMissing
Well what are we waiting for? Let's go in!~|~translationMissing
Go in? You three aren't going through that portal. We have no idea what's on the other side!~|~translationMissing
I have given Persten and [player name] permission to go through. Until we know it's safe, no one else may enter.~|~translationMissing
You can't be serious!~|~translationMissing
Please let us help! We've all worked so hard for an opportunity like this!~|~translationMissing
And we have Persten to look after us!~|~translationMissing
No. You are only apprentices. You were here to help with the incantation, and you've done that now. You should go back to your studies.~|~translationMissing
Come now, Sedridor. The young thingummywuts have proven themselves to be more than capable. Let them have their party!~|~translationMissing
It's going to be quite something! You really should let them help!~|~translationMissing
Quiet, Persten!~|~translationMissing
Let it be known that I consider this a bad idea. That said, they are your apprentices, Traiborn. If they have your permission, I won't stop them.~|~translationMissing
Alright! Ready to make history?~|~translationMissing
Let's go!~|~translationMissing
The five of you enter the portal.~|~translationMissing
Temple of the Eye cutscene continues below.~|~translationMissing
Are the others through the portal?~|~translationMissing
I assume so. You should probably go through and join them.~|~translationMissing
The five of you exit the portal at a strange, watery place.~|~translationMissing
Well this is... unexpected.~|~translationMissing
Where are we?~|~translationMissing
Are we... underwater?~|~translationMissing
The camera pans towards the Temple, and pans back to the group.~|~translationMissing
Let me cast a locator spell!~|~translationMissing
Tamara casts the spell.~|~translationMissing
It seems we're deep below the sea, just south of Morytania!~|~translationMissing
Come, let's look around.~|~translationMissing
This place is brilliant! The apprentices are looking around to see what they can discover. You should join them!~|~translationMissing
Found anything interesting?~|~translationMissing
There's something strange about this big hole here. It's giving out the tiniest amount of magical energy. I can't work out what it is though.~|~translationMissing
You know, those plants look similar to stuff I've seen in the...~|~translationMissing
Quiet! I'm more than capable of working this out. Maybe you should go help the others instead.~|~translationMissing
Any luck with this hole?~|~translationMissing
Don't disturb me! I'll need absolute silence if I'm to work out what this mysterious energy is.~|~translationMissing
That's an interesting statue.~|~translationMissing
See the plaque on it? It reads~|~translationMissing
'Aliya, Justiciar of the Lion and guardian of the Temple of the Eye.'~|~translationMissing
Temple of the Eye?~|~translationMissing
That must be where we are right now! I've read about the justiciars before, in a book back at the Wizards' Tower.~|~translationMissing
What did the book say?~|~translationMissing
They were powerful warriors in service to Saradomin himself, back when the gods still walked among us! This temple must be ancient. Imagine if Saradomin himself once stood here!~|~translationMissing
Still looking at that statue?~|~translationMissing
Isn't it brilliant? A statue of a justiciar! I wish I could have met her!~|~translationMissing
What are you looking at?~|~translationMissing
Look! Rune guardians, like the ones at the Mage Training Arena! If this place was once a teleportation matrix, these rune guardians might have helped the wizards that used it.~|~translationMissing
Anything different about them?~|~translationMissing
Well, despite their age, they're actually of a remarkably similar design to the ones used by modern wizards. Isn't that amazing?~|~translationMissing
Discovered anything more about these rune guardians?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but their mere presence here is an amazing discovery!~|~translationMissing
Hey!~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there. I was lost in thought!~|~translationMissing
What were you thinking about?~|~translationMissing
Hmm? Oh, I was looking at these markings here. They're very interesting! They seem to be radiating a magical energy I've never encountered before!~|~translationMissing
Take a closer look! Maybe you'll feel the energy as well!~|~translationMissing
You look at the markings...~|~translationMissing
You begin to experience a vision, and walk towards a Mysterious Stone.~|~translationMissing
Saradomin be with you.~|~translationMissing
And with you, Zachariah. So, it's really true?~|~translationMissing
Zachariah~|~translationMissing
Indeed it is, Aliya, and he has given us the task of protecting it.~|~translationMissing
Aliya~|~translationMissing
What would he have me do?~|~translationMissing
You must build a sanctuary for the Eye. The forces of chaos already seek to reobtain it, as do countless others.~|~translationMissing
I will keep it safe, no matter the cost. And you?~|~translationMissing
Zamorak has tasked his collector with finding the Eye. I will hunt him down before he does, along with any others who would try to claim it.~|~translationMissing
Then I wish you luck, brother.~|~translationMissing
There is one last thing, Aliya. You must keep the Eye secret from all others, even our own. The fewer people that know the truth, the better.~|~translationMissing
On my honour as a justiciar, it will be done.~|~translationMissing
Good. Saradomin be with you, sister.~|~translationMissing
Jas!~|~translationMissing
What did you say?~|~translationMissing
Did you just say... 'Jas'?~|~translationMissing
I can't remember. When I looked at the marks on the floor I had this... vision, but it's all unclear.~|~translationMissing
Well, time to see what the others have found!~|~translationMissing
The group gathers by the centre of the temple.~|~translationMissing
Abyssal rift cutscene continues below.~|~translationMissing
Hey! Let's see what the others have found!~|~translationMissing
Right, what have we discovered?~|~translationMissing
That large hole behind you is radiating a strange energy. I'm still trying to work out what it is.~|~translationMissing
Need a hand with that?~|~translationMissing
No, I can work it out.~|~translationMissing
You sure can! What else do we have?~|~translationMissing
There's some old rune guardians here with eye symbols on them.~|~translationMissing
So this place was definitely used by wizards at one point. Amazing!~|~translationMissing
Not just any wizards, Saradominist wizards! There's some statues of an old Saradominist Justiciar called Aliya!~|~translationMissing
Remarkable! The justiciars haven't been around for thousands of years. That confirms my suspicions about the age of this place.~|~translationMissing
That's not all I found. Apparently, this place was once called the Temple of the Eye!~|~translationMissing
The Eye? What's the Eye?~|~translationMissing
I remember reading about something called the Eye back at the Wizards' Tower! I only came across mention of it once, but apparently it was a powerful artefact made by Saradomin himself!~|~translationMissing
Sorry... made by Saradomin, you say?~|~translationMissing
That's what the book said. Why?~|~translationMissing
Oh, just checking! I get all caught up in the moment and mishear things sometimes.~|~translationMissing
This 'Eye'... did the book say what it looked like?~|~translationMissing
It didn't. It didn't actually have any other information on it. I tried to learn more from other books, but found nothing.~|~translationMissing
Anything else was probably lost when the first Wizards' Tower burnt down.~|~translationMissing
Of course! I've worked out what the energy from that hole is. It's abyssal energy!~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Yes... Brilliant!~|~translationMissing
Persten?~|~translationMissing
Ah, sorry! Lost in thought again! It was for a good reason though. I think I've just about worked it all out!~|~translationMissing
Amazing as always, Persten! We're so lucky to be able to work with you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you! So, I reckon my theory that this is an old teleportation matrix was spot on! The wizards here must have used power from the Abyss to create portals to the runic altars.~|~translationMissing
Then, with the power from this 'Eye' and support from their rune guardians, they'd have been able to create runes at lightning speed!~|~translationMissing
The Eye must have had a huge impact on their work. They named the temple after it and fashioned a symbol based on it.~|~translationMissing
And we're still using that symbol today! We just never knew why until now!~|~translationMissing
Should we report back to Sedridor?~|~translationMissing
In a moment. I'm just going to cast a simple revealing spell first, just in case there's anything else hidden here.~|~translationMissing
Persten casts a revealing spell, but the Temple begins to rumble.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry! I'm sure everything is fine. Let me handle this.~|~translationMissing
An abyssal rift opens.~|~translationMissing
Huh... now that is a problem.~|~translationMissing
Persten is dragged into the rift.~|~translationMissing
Persten!~|~translationMissing
Abyssal creatures begin coming out of the rift.~|~translationMissing
You don't belong in this temple, accursed filth!~|~translationMissing
Cordelia casts a powerful spell that instantly kills all the invading creatures. Suddenly, the Great Guardian appears from the centre of the Temple.~|~translationMissing
The Great Guardian~|~translationMissing
And so the rift to the Scar is open once more. Humans, fight with us. Let us hold back the Abyss!~|~translationMissing
Great Guardian cutscene continues below.~|~translationMissing
Sedridor! Something's gone wrong!~|~translationMissing
Through the portal! We've opened some sort of rift to the Abyss!~|~translationMissing
Well you'd better get back there and fix it!~|~translationMissing
I... I think so. Sorry... I need a moment to collect myself.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and check on Tamara and Cordelia. I'll be back soon~|~translationMissing
What do we do now? What if more of those creatures come through that rift?~|~translationMissing
Well don't think I'll be stopping them all again! I may be powerful, but that spell still took a lot out of me.~|~translationMissing
Humans, use the cells. Protect me while I close the rift.~|~translationMissing
Cells?~|~translationMissing
Tamara! [player name]! I think I've found something over here!~|~translationMissing
On my way!~|~translationMissing
If you're hoping I can help in some way, you're out of luck. I may be powerful, but that spell still took a lot out of me. You'll have to hope the others can do something.~|~translationMissing
I'll go and see what Felix has found.~|~translationMissing
What have you found?~|~translationMissing
Well... I can't say for sure, but I think the containers on this table contain small amounts of runic energy.~|~translationMissing
Right, I'll take one to Tamara.~|~translationMissing
Just make sure you don't take more than one! I tried to do that already and the energy within them exploded!~|~translationMissing
Alright, thanks for the warning.~|~translationMissing
You should take one of these containers to Tamara. Just don't take more than one or they'll explode!~|~translationMissing
You show the cell to Tamara.~|~translationMissing
This is what Felix found.~|~translationMissing
That must be one of the cells we need! Try placing it in the tile next to me.~|~translationMissing
Try placing that cell in the tile next to me.~|~translationMissing
It worked! This barrier should protect us against those creatures!~|~translationMissing
And just in time too. Here come more of them!~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. The barrier won't hold out for long!~|~translationMissing
Great Guardian~|~translationMissing
Humans, we need more support. Restore my brethren! Place cells within imbued rocks and they will do the rest.~|~translationMissing
Imbued rocks? What does that mean?~|~translationMissing
I'll see if Felix can help.~|~translationMissing
Be careful!~|~translationMissing
I'll see if Felix can help work out what to do next.~|~translationMissing
Felix, we need to place cells in some imbued rocks. Any idea what that means?~|~translationMissing
I think the essence piles here are actually remains of old guardians. They seem to contain elemental and catalytic energies. Perhaps you could try infusing each one with a cell.~|~translationMissing
You'll probably need a chisel to shape the essence first. Looks like there's one on the floor there.~|~translationMissing
Right, I'll get to work.~|~translationMissing
Try infusing each of the essence piles here with a cell. You'll probably need a chisel to shape the essence first. Looks like there's one on the floor there.~|~translationMissing
It worked! Looks like it's following the elemental symbols on the ground.~|~translationMissing
Try creating another one using the other essence pile.~|~translationMissing
Try infusing the other essence pile with a cell like you did with the first one.~|~translationMissing
Amazing! Looks like this one's following the catalytic symbols.~|~translationMissing
These guardians should be strong enough to fend off those creatures. Head back to Tamara and see what we should do next.~|~translationMissing
The guardians should be strong enough to fend off those creatures. Maybe Tamara will know what to do next.~|~translationMissing
You made some rune guardians!~|~translationMissing
And they seem to be holding back those creatures.~|~translationMissing
Humans, I lack the power needed to close the rift! I require runic energy!~|~translationMissing
Runic energy? Do we need more cells?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I don't think they'll work for this. We'll need something else...~|~translationMissing
Of course! We can use the rune guardians! See all the fallen guardians around here? They'd have once been powered using runic energy!~|~translationMissing
If you were to obtain some fragments from them, you might be able to make something to capture the runic energy needed.~|~translationMissing
So mine the fallen guardians?~|~translationMissing
Exactly! Hopefully you can find a pickaxe somewhere. Once you have a few fragments, go and speak to Felix. I'm sure he'll be able to help you use them.~|~translationMissing
Do you have anything to capture some runic energy with?~|~translationMissing
Try mining some fragments from the fallen guardians. Once you have a few, go and speak to Felix. I'm sure he'll be able to help you use them.~|~translationMissing
I think I have enough fragments. I should speak to Felix about what to do with them.~|~translationMissing
We need to power up this big guardian somehow, but I need a way to capture runic energy. Tamara said you might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I reckon this old workbench here might have been used for just that. There's still plenty of pure essence on it for you to use, but that might not be enough...~|~translationMissing
If the player has fragments~|~translationMissing
I have some fragments from the fallen guardians. What if I combined the pure essence with them?~|~translationMissing
If the player has no fragments~|~translationMissing
What if I combined the pure essence with fragments from the fallen guardians?~|~translationMissing
Yes! That would be perfect!~|~translationMissing
I have some fragments from the fallen guardians.~|~translationMissing
Take them to Felix. He'll hopefully know what to do with them.~|~translationMissing
I used the old workbench to make some essence!~|~translationMissing
If you think you have enough, you should take it to Tamara.~|~translationMissing
You show the guardian essence to Tamara.~|~translationMissing
Do you think this will work?~|~translationMissing
Perfect! Now we just need to capture some runic energy with it.~|~translationMissing
I shall now use power from the Abyss to open a portal to the Runic Altar of Mind.~|~translationMissing
Well... I guess that's your answer. Head to the Mind Altar and craft some runes. That essence you have should capture some of the runic energy released. Take an uncharged cell with you as well.~|~translationMissing
I have a theory to test.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Head to the Mind Altar and craft some runes. That essence you made should capture some of the runic energy released. Take an uncharged cell with you as well.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. Maybe Tamara will know what to do.~|~translationMissing
You show the guardian stones to Tamara.~|~translationMissing
Look! This is what happened when I took that essence to the Mind Altar.~|~translationMissing
Great! That's exactly what I was hoping for. What about the cell?~|~translationMissing
It seemed to capture energy from the altar as well.~|~translationMissing
I had a feeling it would! It's all coming together!~|~translationMissing
First, you should use that new cell to replace the one powering the barrier here. I don't think the current one will last much longer.~|~translationMissing
Then just use those stones to power up this big guardian.~|~translationMissing
Just use those stones to power up this big guardian.~|~translationMissing
Human, the stones have fueled me, but more are needed.~|~translationMissing
The guardian still needs more energy!~|~translationMissing
I guess we need to repeat the process again.~|~translationMissing
I shall now use power from the Abyss to open a portal to the Runic Altar of Water.~|~translationMissing
Looks like the portal to the Mind Altar has closed. I guess the guardian only keeps them open for so long. You'll need to use the new portal instead. Make sure you take another uncharged cell with you.~|~translationMissing
Create some more of that essence and use it to capture energy from the Water Altar. You should then be able to use it to power up the guardian again. Make sure you take another uncharged cell with you.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll be back.~|~translationMissing
What should I do to power up the big guardian?~|~translationMissing
You could use the workbench here to combine pure essence with fragments from the nearby fallen guardians. The essence would then be perfect for capturing runic energy.~|~translationMissing
Use some more of that essence to capture energy from the Water Altar. You should then be able to use it to power up the guardian again. Make sure you take another uncharged cell with you.~|~translationMissing
I have some stones I can use to power the big guardian.~|~translationMissing
Great! You should go do that now.~|~translationMissing
Just use those stones to power up the guardian again.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll get right on it.~|~translationMissing
You show the cell and the talisman to Tamara.~|~translationMissing
Something odd happened at the Water Altar. The energy in this cell seems different to before. The essence also formed this strange talisman.~|~translationMissing
Oh, fascinating! I guess it makes sense that the stronger the runic energy, the more powerful the cell will be. After all, water is more powerful than air or mind.~|~translationMissing
Try making another rune guardian using that cell. In the meantime, I'll see if I can work out what this talisman does.~|~translationMissing
Try making another rune guardian using that new cell. In the meantime, I'll see if I can work out what this talisman does.~|~translationMissing
I need to make another rune guardian.~|~translationMissing
Go right ahead. Just use a chisel to shape one of these essence piles and then infuse the result with a cell.~|~translationMissing
Look at that! I don't know what you did, but that guardian is much stronger than the ones you made before.~|~translationMissing
That cell made a more powerful rune guardian!~|~translationMissing
Great! We're almost there! I think we just need to power up this guardian one more time for it to be able to close that rift.~|~translationMissing
I must conserve my power. The portal to the Runic Altar of Water has closed.~|~translationMissing
But we need that portal!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I think there's another way. I reckon that talisman you gave me can be used to return to the Water Altar without the portal being open.~|~translationMissing
Tamara hands you the talisman.~|~translationMissing
Just present that talisman to the statue where the portal to the Water Altar was. Make sure you take more essence and another cell with you.~|~translationMissing
I have another cell. Do you want me to power up the barrier again?~|~translationMissing
That's right! If my theory is correct, it should produce an even stronger barrier!~|~translationMissing
Look! The barrier changed!~|~translationMissing
Just as I thought! We can create better barriers by using stronger cells!~|~translationMissing
Now, let's charge the guardian with those stones you created and close this rift!~|~translationMissing
Let's charge the guardian with those stones you created and close this rift!~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays. The Great Guardian prepares to close the rift.~|~translationMissing
Humans, I now have the power to close the rift. Brace yourselves!~|~translationMissing
The Great Guardian shoots a beam towards the rift, and it fades away.~|~translationMissing
We are safe, for now.~|~translationMissing
What was all that? What happened?~|~translationMissing
That was a rift into an area of the Abyss known as the Scar.~|~translationMissing
The Scar? But I thought this was meant to be a teleportation matrix.~|~translationMissing
You are mistaken. While it is true that teleportation magic is strong here, that is only a side effect of this temple's history.~|~translationMissing
What history?~|~translationMissing
This temple was built to house a powerful artefact. Many sought to claim this artefact for themselves, including servants of the Fallen Empire.~|~translationMissing
In their attempt to claim the artefact, they used magic they did not understand. The rift to the Scar was created as a result.~|~translationMissing
This artefact... you mean the Eye?~|~translationMissing
You are correct. The Eye was removed after the battle, but not before the Justiciar of the Lion used it to seal the rift once more.~|~translationMissing
She then created us, the Guardians of the Rift, to protect this place in the event the rift was ever reopened.~|~translationMissing
And we reopened it.~|~translationMissing
But it's been sealed again now! The danger is gone.~|~translationMissing
Incorrect. Without the power of the Eye, we have no way to seal the rift permanently. It will soon reopen once more. You should leave before that happens.~|~translationMissing
No. This was our mistake. I'm staying to help fix it.~|~translationMissing
Me too!~|~translationMissing
Well if you two are staying, I guess I will as well.~|~translationMissing
Your support will be invaluable.~|~translationMissing
[player name], could you go back to the Wizards' Tower and let Sedridor know what happened here?~|~translationMissing
Alright, if you're absolutely sure about this.~|~translationMissing
What about Persten? We have to help her.~|~translationMissing
No part of the Abyss is more dangerous than the Scar. Your friend will have already been consumed.~|~translationMissing
Now, the power of the Abyss grows. The rift will soon reopen once more. Those of you staying should prepare yourselves.~|~translationMissing
Then I guess I'd better go and see Sedridor. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
The player returns to the Wizards' Tower.~|~translationMissing
Sedridor cutscene continues below.~|~translationMissing
Sedridor! It all went wrong!~|~translationMissing
What do you mean? Was there no teleportation matrix?~|~translationMissing
Kind of, but not really. The portal took us to the Temple of the Eye, an ancient Saradominist temple built to house a powerful artefact.~|~translationMissing
Long ago, a rift to the Abyss was created in the temple, but it was sealed. At least it was, until Persten accidently opened it again...~|~translationMissing
She was sucked into the Abyss, and all these abyssal creatures came out!~|~translationMissing
Abyssal creatures? We have to get in there and stop this!~|~translationMissing
It's okay again, for now. Some rune guardians called the Guardians of the Rift were built to protect the temple from the Abyss. They helped us close the rift again, but they say it will soon reopen.~|~translationMissing
This is a disaster! I knew that teleportation matrix was too good to be true. I should have stopped this, but I was blinded by my own desires for that matrix!~|~translationMissing
What of Traiborn's apprentices?~|~translationMissing
They're safe. They chose to stay and help the Guardians of the Rift keep the rift closed.~|~translationMissing
Then I will ensure they have all the help they need. I will also begin researching this rift at once. Maybe we can still find a way to close it permanently.~|~translationMissing
In the meantime, I suggest you do what you can to help them as well. After all, this is partially your doing.~|~translationMissing
I know. I'll help wherever I'm needed.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]. I appreciate that you did not mean for things to go this way. You should have this. It belonged to Persten. I don't want to think about where she got it.~|~translationMissing
Sedridor shows you a pouch.~|~translationMissing
Do you think she's still alive?~|~translationMissing
Sadly, that seems unlikely. Still, if anyone can survive the Abyss, it's her.~|~translationMissing
Now, we'd better get to work.~|~translationMissing
How are things at the Temple of the Eye?~|~translationMissing
Between the Guardians of the Rift and ourselves, we are managing to keep the Abyss at bay.~|~translationMissing
However, despite all our research, we are no closer to working out how to close the rift permanently.~|~translationMissing
Gaining a better understanding of the artefact that was once there is key, but we have found little mention of this 'Eye'.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure the wizards of the first tower had plenty of research on it. After all, they knew enough about it to use its symbol as the symbol for our order.~|~translationMissing
All that knowledge lost because of those accursed Zamorakians!~|~translationMissing
Anyway, if you wish to help defend the temple, just head through the portal.~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me about the old Wizards' Tower?~|~translationMissing
Of course. The first Wizards' Tower was built at the same time the Order of Wizards was founded. It was at the dawn of the Fifth Age, when the secrets of runecrafting were rediscovered.~|~translationMissing
For years, the tower was a hub of magical research. Wizards of all races and religions were welcomed into our order.~|~translationMissing
Alas, that openness is what ultimately led to disaster. The wizards who served Zamorak, the evil god of chaos, tried to claim our magical discoveries in his name.~|~translationMissing
They failed, but in retaliation, they burnt the entire tower to the ground. Years of work was destroyed.~|~translationMissing
The tower was soon rebuilt of course, but even now we are still trying to regain knowledge that was lost.~|~translationMissing
That's why I spend my time down here, in fact. This basement is all that is left of the old tower, and I believe there are still some secrets to discover here.~|~translationMissing
Of course, one secret I am no longer looking for is the teleportation incantation to the Rune Essence Mine. We have you to thank for that.~|~translationMissing
If the player did not speak to the Mage of Zamorak about the abyssal incantation post-quest~|~translationMissing
If the player spoke to the Mage of Zamorak about the abyssal incantation post-quest~|~translationMissing
I've heard a different take on how the tower burnt down. Something about a ritual gone wrong?~|~translationMissing
Nothing more than Zamorakian hearsay! They burnt the tower down and are now too cowardly to even admit it!~|~translationMissing
About that incantation your initiate gave me...~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the one to trace that amulet. Don't think I didn't notice that you modified the transmission spell I put on it. Next time you need help, we might not be so willing.~|~translationMissing
Well maybe you should have asked first! Besides, you wouldn't have got anything useful out of it. In tracing that amulet, we accidently managed to open an uncontrollable rift to the Abyss.~|~translationMissing
And does this 'we' include the Order of Wizards?~|~translationMissing
I knew it! It's just like them to play with magic they don't understand. First they burnt down the Wizards' Tower, now they're opening uncontrollable abyssal rifts!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps the fools should leave the dangerous magic to us next time!~|~translationMissing
Oh, that reminds me. That incantation didn't appear to be written on parchment. What was it?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... probably the flesh of an abyssal creature. Why do you ask?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I just thought it might be human flesh. I'm relieved it wasn't!~|~translationMissing
You've been spending too much time with your friends in the Order of Wizards! I know that we Zamorakians have a bad reputation, but do you really think we'd be so barbaric?~|~translationMissing

What happened here?~|~translationMissing
She's... she's dead... Thana...~|~translationMissing
I... Thank you for the offer. You can't help though. She's gone.~|~translationMissing
I... I don't know...~|~translationMissing
Right. Let's start with what actually happened. Take a moment to collect yourself and then tell me everything.~|~translationMissing
Okay... Thank you...~|~translationMissing
I'm Mori... I was going to the Library with my friend, Thana. Suddenly, I felt a strange power all through me and then... she... she...~|~translationMissing
...she just died!~|~translationMissing
Just like that? Was she ill?~|~translationMissing
The people of Arceuus don't get ill. We're immortal. We have been for a thousand years, ever since the Ascent of Arceuus. This shouldn't happen... This can't happen...~|~translationMissing
The Ascent of Arceuus?~|~translationMissing
Yes... A long time ago, our leader, Trobin Arceuus, used the Dark Altar to discover the secret of immortality. He came to us and let us share in this secret.~|~translationMissing
The events of that day became known as the Ascent of Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
But something's gone wrong... Thana is dead and I don't know why!~|~translationMissing
We should let someone know about this.~|~translationMissing
You... You're right. We should let the Kourend Council know. Could you help? I don't want to leave her.~|~translationMissing
Start The Ascent of Arceuus quest?~|~translationMissing
Of course I'll help.~|~translationMissing
Thank you... Could you head to Kourend Castle and let Councillor Andrews know what's happened? He's in charge of the council.~|~translationMissing
Will do. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Actually I have something else to do.~|~translationMissing
Oh... Okay...~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't get involved.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Have you spoken to Councillor Andrews yet?~|~translationMissing
Please hurry. You'll find him in Kourend Castle.~|~translationMissing
Good day to you.~|~translationMissing
There's been a death in Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
A death? Well that doesn't seem right. The people of Arceuus don't just die. They can't.~|~translationMissing
I've seen it with my own eyes. A citizen of Arceuus has fallen. What should we do?~|~translationMissing
Well I don't really know what we can do. The Arceuus family have chosen to keep their knowledge secret from the rest of us. We have no expertise in this area.~|~translationMissing
So you'll do nothing?~|~translationMissing
If I could do something, I would. However, I'm afraid this is out of our hands.~|~translationMissing
I see. I suppose I'd better tell Mori.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Time for me to go.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but as I already told you, we can't help.~|~translationMissing
I have. The council won't be helping I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
Oh... I shouldn't be surprised I guess... The council only care about helping themselves.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like you don't like the council much.~|~translationMissing
The council are supposed to rule Kourend, but they never do anything for the people. They shouldn't even exist anyway. They were only meant to rule until the last king's daughter came of age.~|~translationMissing
The council declared her unfit for rule not long after the king died. She disappeared soon after and no one knows what became of her. Now the council are the permanent rulers of Kourend.~|~translationMissing
It was a waste of time even going to them. They were never going to care about Thana.~|~translationMissing
What should we do now?~|~translationMissing
Well... if the Council won't help us, maybe Lord Arceuus will. He doesn't show his face in public much these days but he can't ignore the death of one of his own.~|~translationMissing
Good idea. Where can I find him?~|~translationMissing
He'll be in the Tower of Magic, north west of here.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Have you spoken to Lord Arceuus yet?~|~translationMissing
Please don't take too long. You'll find Lord Arceuus in the Tower of Magic.~|~translationMissing
I need to speak to Lord Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Tower Mage~|~translationMissing
We're currently facing an issue in the Tower of Magic. No one may enter until the issue is resolved.~|~translationMissing
But it's important, there's been a death in Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
A death? This isn't good. The death you speak of may be connected to the issue we are currently facing. You'd better go in.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you want to enter the Tower of Magic? Any items left in the tower, including on death, will be lost forever.~|~translationMissing
Somebody deal with these souls!~|~translationMissing
Thank you for helping with those souls. You should head upstairs and speak with Asteros Arceuus. He might be able to fill you in on what's happening here.~|~translationMissing
Asteros Arceuus~|~translationMissing
Thank you for helping us out with those souls. As you can see, we're facing quite the crisis.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand. What's going on?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid we don't quite know ourselves yet. A short while ago, our instruments detected fluctuations in power from the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
Before we could do anything, we all felt a strange loss of power, as if the Altar had failed altogether.~|~translationMissing
My father was quick to act, using himself as a conduit to channel what little power the altar had left.~|~translationMissing
It seems the loss in power had an interesting impact on our experiments though. Some trapped souls that we were working to free were suddenly released.~|~translationMissing
Alas, whatever happened seemed to cause them great pain, making them to go feral. They are now at peace though, thanks to you.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I have some bad news which is likely related to your crisis. A citizen of Arceuus has died.~|~translationMissing
A death? No! My father acted as fast as he could, but it sounds like he was not fast enough. This is a dark day for Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Tell me, who has fallen?~|~translationMissing
Thana. Mori is with her next to the pond.~|~translationMissing
Dear Thana, you did not deserve this fate. Thank you for bringing this terrible news to us. I will make sure someone is sent out to take care of Thana and Mori.~|~translationMissing
I still don't understand how this happened.~|~translationMissing
Ever since the Ascent of Arceuus, our people have been kept alive by the Dark Altar. Its power sustains our bodies in the same way yours is sustained by food and drink.~|~translationMissing
Without the power of the Dark Altar, there's nothing to keep our people alive. The loss in power from the altar will be what killed Thana.~|~translationMissing
The altar is currently giving out a fraction of the power it normally would. The only thing keeping us alive is my father. His strength won't last forever though.~|~translationMissing
If we can't find and fix whatever has caused this loss of power, our people are surely doomed. Now that those souls have been dealt with, we can perform tests both here and at the altar to try and find the problem.~|~translationMissing
Time is not on our side though, and I fear we won't be fast enough.~|~translationMissing
Well... There is a secret known only to a few of us. At any other time, I would never dream of telling an outsider.~|~translationMissing
But our people's lives are in danger and you may well be the only one who can save us.~|~translationMissing
What is this secret?~|~translationMissing
It's believed by most that the knowledge of immortality was discovered by my father. The truth is, the discovery was not his.~|~translationMissing
To the west of here, lies the sulphur volcano of Mount Karuulm. Within live the Tasakaal, three ancient beings with power over life and death. They granted my father the knowledge that led to the Ascent of Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
And you think they can help us?~|~translationMissing
Their knowledge of the Dark Altar far exceeds ours. If anyone can help us, it's them. Ideally I'd send one of our own, but I have no one to spare. You are the only one who can help us.~|~translationMissing
I'd better not waste any time then.~|~translationMissing
Thank you friend. You'll find Mount Karuulm on the other side of Lovakengj. Please hurry.~|~translationMissing
Please hurry to Mount Karuulm. The Tasakaal may be the only ones who can save us. You'll find the volcano on the other side of Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
Human.~|~translationMissing
Leave us.~|~translationMissing
Your presence is not desired.~|~translationMissing
But I need your help! I was sent by Asteros Arceuus, son of Lord Trobin Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
We know that name.~|~translationMissing
The name of a liar.~|~translationMissing
Liar?~|~translationMissing
They came to us. Two of them.~|~translationMissing
The brother and the husband.~|~translationMissing
Her time was running out. They wanted to give her more.~|~translationMissing
We granted them knowledge. To give her more time.~|~translationMissing
But they misused it. And the world suffered.~|~translationMissing
This knowledge? You mean immortality?~|~translationMissing
In a way. But it was not meant for that.~|~translationMissing
Time was what it was meant for. But time still runs out.~|~translationMissing
They put an end to time. They endangered the balance.~|~translationMissing
What balance?~|~translationMissing
For every death, there must be life.~|~translationMissing
For every life, there must be death.~|~translationMissing
Perfectly balanced.~|~translationMissing
As all things should be.~|~translationMissing
We serve this balance.~|~translationMissing
For without balance, the world burns.~|~translationMissing
You're very confusing, you know that right?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps our knowledge is beyond your understanding.~|~translationMissing
Well thankfully I didn't come here for knowledge. I came here for help. The Dark Altar is failing and the people of Arceuus are in danger. I need you to help me find the cause.~|~translationMissing
The people of Arceuus have had their time.~|~translationMissing
This will restore balance.~|~translationMissing
Why should we help them?~|~translationMissing
*sigh* It can never be easy can it.~|~translationMissing
Fine. If you help me save the people of Arceuus, then I will help you.~|~translationMissing
You assume we need help.~|~translationMissing
I've done this enough times to know that everyone wants something, even the masters of life and death.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. Maybe the human is not as stupid as it looks.~|~translationMissing
Well I've been known to have my moments.~|~translationMissing
Very well human.~|~translationMissing
We admit, the Arceuus people do have their uses.~|~translationMissing
Their work with souls has been useful in helping to maintain the balance.~|~translationMissing
We will help them. But first, you will serve us.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. What do you need from me?~|~translationMissing
To the south lies a battlefront.~|~translationMissing
There is a grave there. Within it lies a soul, trapped inside a corpse.~|~translationMissing
Free this soul. In return, we will provide our help.~|~translationMissing
So you just want me to kill a zombie?~|~translationMissing
A zombie is soulless. An empty shell, reanimated by magic.~|~translationMissing
This is a soul. Trapped in this world, when it should have long departed.~|~translationMissing
Its existence is an affront to the balance.~|~translationMissing
Seems pretty simple.~|~translationMissing
Which is why it falls to you.~|~translationMissing
Consider it a test.~|~translationMissing
If you pass.~|~translationMissing
We may have further use for you.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Very well, I'll go and free this soul.~|~translationMissing
Free the trapped soul.~|~translationMissing
You'll find it in a grave.~|~translationMissing
By the battlefront to the south.~|~translationMissing
I've dealt with the trapped soul.~|~translationMissing
You have done well.~|~translationMissing
The balance has been restored.~|~translationMissing
And now we shall help you.~|~translationMissing
While you were busy, so were we.~|~translationMissing
We have found the cause of your problem.~|~translationMissing
You said the altar was failing.~|~translationMissing
This is not correct.~|~translationMissing
The altar is fine, but its power has been redirected.~|~translationMissing
Redirected where?~|~translationMissing
To a construct built by a mortal.~|~translationMissing
Right next to the altar.~|~translationMissing
Find it. Destroy it.~|~translationMissing
And Arceuus will be saved.~|~translationMissing
So I just have to go to the Dark Altar, find this device and then destroy it. Sounds easy enough.~|~translationMissing
Then you have what you need.~|~translationMissing
You can leave us.~|~translationMissing
Go and save your people.~|~translationMissing
Go to the Dark Altar.~|~translationMissing
Find and destroy the construct.~|~translationMissing
There. That's the device destroyed. The people of Arceuus should be safe now. I'd better go to the Tower of Magic and check.~|~translationMissing
Whatever you did, it seems to have worked. Everything is back to normal. You should talk to my father, he'll want to thank you.~|~translationMissing
Lord Arceuus?~|~translationMissing
You're the one that saved our people. On behalf of all of Arceuus, I thank you.~|~translationMissing
So everything is okay now?~|~translationMissing
It seems so. A short while ago I felt the power of the Dark Altar return to normal levels. I was safely able to stop my ritual and let the altar work on its own again.~|~translationMissing
Now tell me, what was the cause of this and how did you stop it?~|~translationMissing
Your son recommended that I speak to the Tasakaal. They had me perform a task for them but after that they agreed to help. They didn't seem to like you much though.~|~translationMissing
Well that's no surprise. The Tasakaal seem to feel that only they deserve immortality. It's rather hypocritical of them. It clearly didn't stop them helping you though.~|~translationMissing
They were reluctant, but they admitted that the people of Arceuus were useful to them.~|~translationMissing
Such is their way. They act superior to us, but the reality is they'll work with anyone if they think it will further their aims.~|~translationMissing
So how did they help you?~|~translationMissing
They found out that the power of the altar was being redirected into a device hidden nearby. I found the device and destroyed it.~|~translationMissing
A device? What was it?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure, but the Tasakaal said it was made by a mortal.~|~translationMissing
The Tasakaal view everyone who isn't one of them as a mere mortal, even those of us who have also achieved immortality. That doesn't narrow down the options very much.~|~translationMissing
This is most concerning though. If someone deliberately sabotaged the altar, who knows what else they might do. I'll have someone recover the remains of this device. Maybe we can work out where it came from.~|~translationMissing
For now though, I'd like to once again thank you for your help. Today was a dark day for our people but without you it would have been our end. Please accept these gifts. They are the least you deserve.~|~translationMissing
Now, can I help you further?~|~translationMissing

Captain Tock~|~translationMissing
Ahoy, young [lad/lass]. Might ye be able to help me, perhaps? I be in a spot of bother.~|~translationMissing
I be the Corsair Captain! Captain of the Corsairs of Corsair Cove! My gallant band of corsairs are famed in song and story among all seafarers.~|~translationMissing
I've never heard of you.~|~translationMissing
Arrr... well, ye can boast of yer ignorance if ye likes, but it don't make ye sound smarter.~|~translationMissing
Well, as I were saying, young [lad/lass], I be in a spot of bother, and I thought ye might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
What kind of help do you need?~|~translationMissing
It be about my crew. They be a lazy bunch at times, but they be stout in the heart and strong in the arm, and they don't deserve what's happened to them...~|~translationMissing
It be a curse! A curse has been laid upon my crew! That's the only thing it can be.~|~translationMissing
So I need a young [lad/lass] such as yerself to find a way to lift the curse. Will ye help me?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I'll try to help with your curse.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Thanks, young [lad/lass]. And a worthy [lad/lass] ye must surely be, brave in the heart and stiff in the spine.~|~translationMissing
Now, I've a ship moored west of Rimmington. Come and meet me on board, and we'll set off to Corsair Cove.~|~translationMissing
West of Rimmington, you say? Okay, I'll meet you on board your ship there.~|~translationMissing
Captain Tock swaggers off towards Rimmington.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm not available.~|~translationMissing
Arrr. Some other time, perhaps...~|~translationMissing
Arrr, ye've found my ship - good [lad/lass]. I used to command a much larger vessel, sailing the seas with my crew of Corsairs, but now we be settled in Corsair Cove.~|~translationMissing
My Corsairs be a good crew, but this curse has laid them low, all except me. Sickly, they be. Too weak to stand. Ye'll see fer yerself soon enough.~|~translationMissing
There be four of 'em afflicted by the curse - Gnocci, Ithoi, Arsen and young Colin. All taken to their beds, a- mewlin' and a-pukin' like so many babbies.~|~translationMissing
I've another crewman, Francois, but he be away on a mission. I hope he be spared!~|~translationMissing
Now be ye ready to voyage to Corsair Cove to help 'em? I can sail ye back here any time ye likes.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm ready go to Corsair Cove.~|~translationMissing
The ship sails to Corsair Cove...~|~translationMissing
Not just now, thanks.~|~translationMissing
That's fair enough, young [lad/lass], but perhaps ye'll return to help me soon...~|~translationMissing
Arsen the Thief~|~translationMissing
Urgh!~|~translationMissing
I hear you've been cursed.~|~translationMissing
I think so. That navigator, Ithoi, always warned us that this kind of thing could happen, but I didn't think it could possibly be real. But now this has happened, and I think it's my fault.~|~translationMissing
You should maybe see what Ithoi thinks. He's been cursed too, so I guess he'll be in his hut, off to the south-west, near the shore.~|~translationMissing
Urgh to you too, with candy sprinkles on.~|~translationMissing
A sympathetic soul you are. I'm in real pain here.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I hear you've been cursed.~|~translationMissing
Cabin Boy Colin~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry! Tell her I'm sorry! Then maybe she'll make the pain stop...~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's what it must be. Ithoi, the navigator, always told us to beware of curses. You should talk to him - he really knows about these things.~|~translationMissing
Ithoi lives in the hut to the south-west, nearest to the sea.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you can tell me about it another time.~|~translationMissing
I'll be here. I'm not going anywhere while I feel so sick.~|~translationMissing
Gnocci the Cook~|~translationMissing
My stomach!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think She did this to us. I should have left Her alone. Ithoi told us to beware of this kind of thing.~|~translationMissing
Ithoi's been cursed too. You can probably find him in his hut, south-west from here.~|~translationMissing
My lower intestine!~|~translationMissing
... look, I'm in a lot of pain here. We're not playing Name Your Favourite Body Part.~|~translationMissing
Ithoi the Navigator~|~translationMissing
Arrr, we be cursed, we be CURSED! It be a curse upon us!~|~translationMissing
Aye? D'ye think so? Really? Am I not a picture of health an' beauty?~|~translationMissing
YES - WE'VE BEEN CURSED!~|~translationMissing
I've sailed the seas all my life. I sailed the seas as a man, like I sailed 'em as a boy.~|~translationMissing
I even sailed the seas during that tricky phase in between, when ye'r not quite a man yet, but ye'r not really a boy anymore. But I don't want to talk about that bit.~|~translationMissing
Um...~|~translationMissing
The point I'm makin' is that I know the seas like I know the palm of my hand. I've been to strange lands an' seen things that'll make yer juices turn in yer veins.~|~translationMissing
I've seen dancing fish-women, monkey-kings, huge men in turbans from the far West selling treasure maps - you name it, an' I've seen it.~|~translationMissing
There be more things in the world than ye dreams of in yer fancy book-learnin'! An' most of 'em be hostile. Could be any number of things brought this curse upon us. Demons, evil spirits, anything!~|~translationMissing
Okay, it doesn't sound like you know what's behind the curse. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
Arrr!~|~translationMissing
I think I'll leave you to get on with it.~|~translationMissing
... arrr.~|~translationMissing
Have ye any idea about how to lift the curse?~|~translationMissing
I've spoken to some of your crew.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Make sure ye speaks to 'em all. They'll be in their huts, over to the west. Four of them, there are - Gnocci, Ithoi, Arsen and young Colin.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Please take me back to Rimmington.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll talk to you later.~|~translationMissing
I think so. That navigator, Ithoi, always warned us that this kind of thing could happen.~|~translationMissing
I've met him. He definitely thinks it's a curse, but wasn't able to say exactly what caused it.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid it may be all my fault.~|~translationMissing
Captain Tock had me exploring some caves, west of the cove. I'm a thief, see, like my brother Francois, and the Captain thought I could sneak past the monsters without being noticed.~|~translationMissing
Well, I climbed down the vines, and found a big cave filled with terrifying ogres!~|~translationMissing
I'd hoped I could use my amazing Thieving skills to avoid them seeing me, but I was out of luck. By the time I'd finished clambering down the ladder, they'd spotted me.~|~translationMissing
So you were trying to explore that ogre cave, and the ogres saw you?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I quickly grabbed some loot, so I wouldn't have to face the Captain empty-handed, and fled up the ladder before the ogres could kill me!~|~translationMissing
But a couple of days later we all fell ill. I think what I stole must have been some kind of sacred relic, and the shamans in the cave have cursed us for stealing it.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you could get the relic back from the Captain, and return it to the ogres? And tell them I'm very sorry. Then perhaps they'll lift the curse.~|~translationMissing
Have you got that relic back from Captain Tock? Maybe if you return it to the ogres, they'll lift the curse.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not talked to Captain Tock yet~|~translationMissing
Nope, I've not done that.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not talked to Chief Tess~|~translationMissing
Please take it back to the ogres for me, and tell them I'm sorry.~|~translationMissing
Arsen says he gave you a sacred ogre relic.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, that he did. I'd sent him to explore the caves west of the cove, an' he brings me back a bone lump, saying he stole it from the ogre chief.~|~translationMissing
He thinks the ogres have cursed you all because he stole one of their sacred relics, and he wants me to take it back to them now.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, I've no use fer the silly thing. If it'll get the curse lifted, ye can take it right to that ogre chief an' give it back.~|~translationMissing
Captain Tock gives you the loot that Arsen stole from the ogre chief.~|~translationMissing
Chief Tess~|~translationMissing
What you want, skinny creature?~|~translationMissing
A man called Arsen told me he'd visited your cave.~|~translationMissing
Yah, skinny man climb down vine the other day. Little man, big idiot! Hahahaha...~|~translationMissing
He says he's very sorry...~|~translationMissing
He very silly!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I should come back another time.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll leave you alone, sorry.~|~translationMissing
I've come to return what Arsen stole.~|~translationMissing
Arsen says he's very sorry for stealing from you. Here it is...~|~translationMissing
You present Tess with Arsen's loot.~|~translationMissing
Yah, dat little man is big idiot. Climbed down vine, grabbed tooth-pick off Tess and ran away like scared kebbit.~|~translationMissing
You're saying this is a tooth-pick? Not a sacred relic of the ogres? Did your shamans curse the Corsairs for stealing it?~|~translationMissing
Dis is tooth-pick. Tess got plenty more. If skinny idiot man want Tess' old tooth-pick, maybe he sick in his head. But Tess not having shamans curse anyone.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Well, I guess Arsen will be pleased to hear he didn't bring the curse upon the Corsairs.~|~translationMissing
Have you returned the sacred relic to the ogres? Will they forgive me and lift the curse?~|~translationMissing
Their chief, Tess, says that wasn't a sacred relic at all. It was her tooth-pick.~|~translationMissing
Are you telling me the ogres cursed us all because I stole their chief's tooth-pick?~|~translationMissing
She didn't care - she's got lots of tooth-picks, and she just thought you were some kind of weirdo when you stole one. They never cursed you at all.~|~translationMissing
Oh. That's a relief, I guess. Um... thank you for your help. But I do wonder where the curse really came from.~|~translationMissing
I'm not done investigating yet.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's what it must be. Ithoi, the navigator, always told us to beware of curses.~|~translationMissing
This is all my fault. But I didn't mean to upset her. I just thought we could be friends. Now I must have upset her, and she's cursed us all!~|~translationMissing
Ithoi always told us that bad things happen to sailors who get involved with mermaids, but I didn't believe him. I should have listened! But I'll tell you what happened...~|~translationMissing
I was using Ithoi's telescope...~|~translationMissing
A flashback to a few nights ago...~|~translationMissing
Such a beautiful night!~|~translationMissing
What lands lie beyond the dim horizon, I wonder...~|~translationMissing
Colin uses the telescope at Ithoi's hut.~|~translationMissing
Eh?~|~translationMissing
What was that? I'd better have another look.~|~translationMissing
Colin uses the telescope again.~|~translationMissing
Is that what I think it is?~|~translationMissing
It's so dark out there, but I think... ... yes, I'm quite sure...~|~translationMissing
... yes, it's a mermaid! She's beautiful!~|~translationMissing
You're the most lovely person I've ever seen!~|~translationMissing
I can see you moving your arms, but it's very dark. Are you waving to me?~|~translationMissing
*kiss*~|~translationMissing
Oh, no, I think she's gone away. Did I put her off?~|~translationMissing
Maybe she doesn't like strangers shouting about her appearance and blowing kisses at her. That might have been rude of me.~|~translationMissing
I hope she's not angry. Ithoi says mermaids can be dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you can find the mermaid and tell her I'm very sorry I was rude to her. Then maybe she'll lift the curse.~|~translationMissing
Have you found the mermaid yet? Will she forgive me?~|~translationMissing
Where did you find this mermaid?~|~translationMissing
I was using Ithoi's telescope to look out at the sea, imagining the strange lands and fantastic creatures Ithoi's always telling us he's seen, and I saw her.~|~translationMissing
Nope, I've not seen any mermaids round here.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, oh dear. Maybe we'll be cursed forever!~|~translationMissing
Let's see if I can find that mermaid he saw...~|~translationMissing
An ogre approaches the telescope's view.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Big Chompy Bird Hunting~|~translationMissing
That doesn't look anything like a mermaid. That's an ogre!~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Big Chompy Bird Hunting~|~translationMissing
That doesn't look anything like a mermaid. That's Bugs, the son of that chompy hunter, Rantz!~|~translationMissing
I've seen enough of that ogre already. Colin might be relieved to hear it wasn't a mermaid.~|~translationMissing
I've looked through that telescope myself. That wasn't a mermaid. That was a wet ogre.~|~translationMissing
He's definitely not a mermaid.~|~translationMissing
I've met that ogre before. He lives with his dad in the Feldip Hills. He's definitely not a mermaid.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Oh, I see. Okay... I guess that means I didn't upset a mermaid after all. So the curse isn't my fault! Thank you!~|~translationMissing
How are you feeling?~|~translationMissing
I still feel awful. But I'm glad you've proven it wasn't my fault that we got cursed. I hope you can work out what brought it on us.~|~translationMissing
I'll be on the case.~|~translationMissing
It's all my fault, I know it is. I've awoken Her, and now She's done this to us!~|~translationMissing
Who are you talking about?~|~translationMissing
I'll explain... See, I'm the cook, and I have to find the food as well as cooking it...~|~translationMissing
I was fishing...~|~translationMissing
A flashback to a few days ago...~|~translationMissing
Let's see what I can find for the boys tonight.~|~translationMissing
C'mon little lobsters, come to Gnocci!~|~translationMissing
Obby-lobby obby-lobby oi oi oi!~|~translationMissing
'obby-lobby' - what?~|~translationMissing
It's a traditional lobster-fishing chant handed down by my ancestors. Don't interrupt.~|~translationMissing
C'mon little lobsters. We don't want to keep the Captain waiting! He'll get angry with me again.~|~translationMissing
Ooh, what's this? This isn't a lobster.~|~translationMissing
Looks more like a child's toy. But - no, it can't be...~|~translationMissing
Is it moving?~|~translationMissing
She's moving! SHE'S POSSESSED! HELP!~|~translationMissing
The player's screen is shown the sight of a possessed doll. The next scene depicts him burying the doll beneath a nearby tree, and promptly running away.~|~translationMissing
I buried Her in the sand, by that tree, to the west. But I still feel Her eyes staring into my soul. Please find Her, and kill the demon inside!~|~translationMissing
Have you tried to destroy Her yet? Her eyes, those terrible eyes!~|~translationMissing
Where did you say this happened?~|~translationMissing
On the beach, to the west of the cove. Near a big tree. I buried Her in the sand, but I can still feel her eyes staring into my soul. Please find Her, and kill the demon inside!~|~translationMissing
No, I've not.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I feel terrible. Please help us soon.~|~translationMissing
Okay, he said he buried the possessed doll in the sand...~|~translationMissing
Search for the possessed doll and face the consequences.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 18 Crafting~|~translationMissing
That's not possessed. That sounds more like clockwork.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 18 Crafting~|~translationMissing
That's not possessed. That sounds more like clockwork. In fact I've got the Crafting level to make those.~|~translationMissing
Leave the thing alone.~|~translationMissing
Actually, it sounds scary.~|~translationMissing
Well, sort of. That doll wasn't possessed at all. It was a clockwork toy. They're supposed to move.~|~translationMissing
Clockwork? Oh, that would explain how it moved. Ahem. Well, I suppose the curse didn't come from Her.~|~translationMissing
I hope you can find the real cause soon.~|~translationMissing
Still trying.~|~translationMissing
Ye be back? Tell me, do those scurvy Corsairs take the curse seriously?~|~translationMissing
I've been hearing about what might have caused it...~|~translationMissing
Colin thought he upset a mermaid, and she might have cursed you all in revenge.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! That'll teach him to meddle with such folk. Colin should stick to what he's good at.~|~translationMissing
Gnocci fished a doll out of the water, and he thought it might have been possessed by an evil spirit.~|~translationMissing
Arrr chuckie chuckie chuckie! That'll teach him to play with dolls at his age. Dolls can be frightening.~|~translationMissing
Arsen stole what he thought was a sacred relic from the ogre cave, and he said their shamans might have cursed you in revenge.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Ogre women be powerful, an' Arsen be a fool.~|~translationMissing
I'll carry on trying to solve the curse.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Off ye goes...~|~translationMissing
They all have different theories about the curse.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, that be likely enough. Ithoi tells me there be many things in this world that can bring a curse upon an unwary seafarer.~|~translationMissing
Ye can maybe solve the problem fer each victim, an' see if it lifts the curse.~|~translationMissing
I've ruled out all the Corsairs' theories...~|~translationMissing
Cabin-boy Colin thought he'd upset a mermaid, but there wasn't a mermaid, just a wet ogre.~|~translationMissing
Arsen the Thief thought he'd upset the ogre shamans by stealing a sacred ogre relic, but it was just a tooth-pick, and the ogres didn't care.~|~translationMissing
Ithoi the Navigator said there were lots of things that could bring a curse on a crew, and this could be any of them.~|~translationMissing
And Gnocci the Cook thought he'd awoken a demon in a possessed doll, but it wasn't possessed at all. It was clockwork.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, any sufficiently advanced technology be indistinguishable from demonic possession, that it be.~|~translationMissing
So what do I do now?~|~translationMissing
I see. You're saying it began after they'd all eaten, but Ithoi felt ill even though he'd not had any of the food.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, that be right.~|~translationMissing
That meal must have been interesting...~|~translationMissing
Can I give up and go home?~|~translationMissing
If ye wants a ride back to Rimmington, I'll take ye there any time, but I do hope ye can help my poor crew.~|~translationMissing
You said it began after they'd all eaten.~|~translationMissing
Ye be back? Have ye been investigatin' the curse?~|~translationMissing
I hear it happened straight after dinner.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! That be wrong! I were away for a parlay with Captain Tock, an' I didn't eat that dinner at all. The Captain can tell ye so himself.~|~translationMissing
So it must be a curse. A CURSE!~|~translationMissing
I'm still looking into it.~|~translationMissing
You don't feel you need to see the sea any closer up. It's right in front of you already.~|~translationMissing
Have you solved the curse yet?~|~translationMissing
Hey, don't go blaming the cook just because the curse began after dinner. I didn't even cook that meal. I'd been too scared of the possessed doll...~|~translationMissing
You mean the clockwork doll?~|~translationMissing
It's an easy mistake to make!~|~translationMissing
Anyway I didn't dare try to fish after that, and Ithoi volunteered to do all the fishing and cooking instead, before he went off for his parlay with Captain Tock.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, Ithoi got sick without even eating it, so it can't be the food.~|~translationMissing
If the player has spoken to Arsen beforehand~|~translationMissing
I hear the Captain's thinking of firing Ithoi.~|~translationMissing
I don't see why that's got anything to do with the curse.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps not.~|~translationMissing
So you say Ithoi prepared that meal?~|~translationMissing
Yes, he volunteered to do all the fishing and cooking for me, even though he knew he'd miss dinner for his parlay with Captain Tock. Ithoi's a good soul.~|~translationMissing
Have you found out how we all got cursed?~|~translationMissing
That's right. Gnocci had cooked us some swordfish. It didn't taste as good as his usual cooking, but I didn't complain. The Captain doesn't like complainers.~|~translationMissing
Then we all started feeling sick and clammy. That was when the Captain and Ithoi came back from their parlay, and Ithoi looked sick too.~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose we don't need a navigator these days, and he's not very good at anything else. But I don't see why that's got anything to do with the curse.~|~translationMissing
Do you know how we all got cursed?~|~translationMissing
I hear Ithoi cooked the meal you ate that night.~|~translationMissing
I suppose Ithoi's trying to be extra helpful at the moment. Don't tell anyone, but Ithoi might not be in our crew much longer.~|~translationMissing
My brother, Francois, says the Captain will make him second-in-command if he completes his mission. That's Ithoi's rank, but we don't need a navigator now we've settled here, and he can't do much else.~|~translationMissing
What is the mission Francois is doing?~|~translationMissing
That's a secret.~|~translationMissing
I hear you're thinking of firing Ithoi.~|~translationMissing
Arrr, maybe I am, but I'm sure that be nothing to do wi' the curse. Ithoi's afflicted by it too.~|~translationMissing
I hear you cooked the meal they ate before getting sick.~|~translationMissing
Arrr? And what if I did? Can't an old sailor help his crew without interfering young land-lubbers making accusations?~|~translationMissing
Maybe because the Captain's thinking of firing you.~|~translationMissing
Maybe because the Captain's thinking of firing you - Arsen heard it from his brother. The Corsairs don't need a navigator anymore.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Too clever ye be... I heard the Captain might kick me off the crew, so I poisoned the dinner, an' acted sick too. Now they think they're cursed, so they'll want me around, wi' my knowledge o' such things!~|~translationMissing
But they all think I'm sick, so they'll never believe I'm behind it. Hahaha!~|~translationMissing
We'll see what they have to say about that!~|~translationMissing
Maybe you're just a nasty person.~|~translationMissing
Bah! Ye can't even think of a reason why I'd want to poison the crew, so don't bother me with yer accusations.~|~translationMissing
I don't know your reason.~|~translationMissing
Ithoi admits poisoning you all and faking the curse.~|~translationMissing
If Ithoi's been afflicted by the curse as badly as I have, he might be half out of his mind with pain. I'm sure he doesn't know what he's saying.~|~translationMissing
That can't be right - he looks as sick as the rest of us. Maybe he's delerious and doesn't know what he's saying.~|~translationMissing
He's had a lot to worry about, with losing his place on the crew, and now he's sick from the curse too. He must have gone mad and started babbling.~|~translationMissing
Ithoi admits he poisoned the crew!~|~translationMissing
Ithoi admits he poisoned the crew! He's faked this whole curse!~|~translationMissing
That can't be! Ithoi's sick, an' he may be babbling madness from his fevered brain. Ye'll have to prove he's not really sick.~|~translationMissing
What d'ye want now?~|~translationMissing
I know you've faked the curse.~|~translationMissing
The Corsairs all think I'm sick too, even though I never ate the food. An' ye'll never make me prove that I'm healthy - I ain't gettin' up! So they'll keep believing in the curse.~|~translationMissing
I bet I can prove you're well enough to get up.~|~translationMissing
Ye'll never make me get up! I ain't afraid of cold, nor of wet, nor of anythin' ye can do in here.~|~translationMissing
Um... nothing, really.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I should try to get more information out of him before trying to make his hut catch fire.~|~translationMissing
You light the driftwood...~|~translationMissing
Arrr... uh-oh!~|~translationMissing
Ithoi rushes out of the hut.~|~translationMissing
Ithoi casts Water Strike, extinguishing the fire, and returns to his hut.~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess that proves he's well enough to get up! And apparently he knows some magic too.~|~translationMissing
I saw you running around! You're not sick!~|~translationMissing
So long as that old fool, Tock, believes it's a curse, I've nothing to fear from ye flapping yer mouth.~|~translationMissing
We'll see what the Captain has to say about that.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me what's going on now?~|~translationMissing
Ithoi's faked the curse. I've seen him running around, healthy.~|~translationMissing
Make sure he gets what's coming to him. No-one poisons my crew!~|~translationMissing
So what's going on now?~|~translationMissing
It sounds like there isn't a curse after all! Maybe I'll recover soon from whatever he did to me.~|~translationMissing
What's happening now?~|~translationMissing
Give him what he deserves!~|~translationMissing
So what's happening now?~|~translationMissing
I've seen Ithoi running around. He's not sick at all.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! So he was never sick at all! An' here's me been feeling sorry for him. A trickster he be indeed! Kill him fer me.~|~translationMissing
Why don't you kill him yourself?~|~translationMissing
A captain shouldn't leave his ship in a time of crisis. Rule of the sea, that is. Even if the crisis ain't exactly on the ship.~|~translationMissing
I don't believe in capital punishment.~|~translationMissing
One of the following will be said while hitting him~|~translationMissing
Ye'll pay!~|~translationMissing
Curse you!~|~translationMissing
Curse 'em all!~|~translationMissing
Arrr, land-lubber!~|~translationMissing
As he dies~|~translationMissing
Awww!~|~translationMissing
Ithoi faked the curse, and I've killed him.~|~translationMissing
You think you know a guy, and then he does a thing like this! Oh well, I hope I recover soon from whatever he did to me.~|~translationMissing
Not much.~|~translationMissing
Who'd have thought Ithoi would do such a thing? I guess if there isn't really a curse, I'll get better soon. In fact I feel better already.~|~translationMissing
I really didn't think he was like that. Still, if there isn't really a curse, I suppose we'll just get better from whatever he did to us. I don't feel so bad now.~|~translationMissing
I've killed Ithoi for poisoning your crew.~|~translationMissing
Thank ye fer dealing with that serpent. I suppose the rest of my crew will feel better now ye've proven there be no curse on them.~|~translationMissing
Most of them deleterious effects probably be psychosomatic anyway, arrr!~|~translationMissing
Anyways, ye've been a mighty help, young [lad/lass]. Ye be brave in the heart, strong in the arm and full in the bowels, an' I be grateful to ye.~|~translationMissing
Tell ye what, I'll have a word with Yusuf, in the bank. Ye've earned the right to use his services. An' thanks again, very much.~|~translationMissing

3.6 Talking to Lord Hosidius again before getting the full reward~|~translationMissing
I am Lord Kandur Hosidius, ruler of this city. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm [player name].~|~translationMissing
Pleased to meet you [player name]. It is a shame we could not meet in better circumstances.~|~translationMissing
Anything I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
Our family is in dire need of assistance. Alas, I do not feel I can trust you enough to involve you in this.~|~translationMissing
Our family is in dire need of assistance. My eldest son, Artur, has gone missing and we could desperately use some help in finding him.~|~translationMissing
If the player has sufficient Hosidius favour~|~translationMissing
You are a friend of Hosidius. Would you be willing to assist us? You will be rewarded if you bring him home safe.~|~translationMissing
If the player has insufficient Hosidius favour~|~translationMissing
Would you be willing to assist us? You will be rewarded if you bring him home safe.~|~translationMissing
Start The Depths of Despair quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes I would. What do you need me to do?~|~translationMissing
Thank you friend. I suggest you begin your search by talking to my family and servants. One of them might know where Artur has gone.~|~translationMissing
No. I'm afraid I have other things to be doing.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind please return to me as soon as you can.~|~translationMissing
Until next time.~|~translationMissing
Have you find my son yet?~|~translationMissing
I suggest you begin your search by talking to my family and servants. One of them might know where he's gone.~|~translationMissing
Butler Jarvis~|~translationMissing
Good day [sir/madam].~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'm helping Lord Hosidius find his missing son. I was wondering if you could help me.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I know not where Artur has gone. I do not speak to him much. He keeps himself to himself.~|~translationMissing
However, I've noticed him speaking to Olivia before. Maybe she can help.~|~translationMissing
Good day [sir/madam] I hope your quest is going well.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I...~|~translationMissing
Elena Hosidius~|~translationMissing
You're the one helping to find our son.~|~translationMissing
Yes I...~|~translationMissing
It's good that you're here to help. Artur is a good lad, but he does have a habit of biting off more than he can chew.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if...~|~translationMissing
He's meant for greatness you know. He'll be a king one day.~|~translationMissing
Don't you mean...~|~translationMissing
Lord. I meant to say lord. Now be on your way. Artur needs your help.~|~translationMissing
Hello, I'm helping Lord Hosidius find his missing son. I was wondering if you had any idea where he might have gone?~|~translationMissing
Chef Olivia~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything.~|~translationMissing
Well... I err...~|~translationMissing
Err?~|~translationMissing
Oh this is awful. Please don't tell Lord Hosidius. He'll fire me if he finds out.~|~translationMissing
Calm down, you have nothing to fear from me. I just want to help find Artur. Do you know where he is?~|~translationMissing
Artur and I, we're...~|~translationMissing
You're in love aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Well don't worry, your secret is safe with me.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Before he went missing, Artur told me he was going to find the original copy of the Royal Accord of Twill. That's where he will have gone.~|~translationMissing
He's been spending a lot of time in the Arceuus Library recently, researching the Accord. He mentioned a librarian called Galana. Maybe she can help you.~|~translationMissing
Please bring Artur back.~|~translationMissing
Galana~|~translationMissing
Do you need something?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for information on the Royal Accord of Twill.~|~translationMissing
The Royal Accord of Twill was signed by the heads of Kourend's five houses, known then as the Royal Lords. This was over a thousand years ago.~|~translationMissing
The Accord declared that they would take over rulership of Great Kourend from the Council of Elders.~|~translationMissing
For many years after the Accord was signed, the Royal Lords took it in turns to rule the kingdom. Each of them ruled for ten years in turn.~|~translationMissing
Those practices have long since been abolished though and Kourend is now ruled by the Kourend Council. The original Accord has since been lost, but copies still exist in this library.~|~translationMissing
What if I wanted to find the original?~|~translationMissing
Many have tried and failed. You would likely have no better luck. However, if it interests you, you might wish to read The Envoy to Varlamore, by Deryk Paulson.~|~translationMissing
It details how the original Accord was lost.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where I can find the book?~|~translationMissing
Try the [top/middle/bottom] floor, [north/south] [eastern/western] bay.~|~translationMissing
Could you remind me where I can find that book on the Accord?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the book~|~translationMissing
You find~|~translationMissing
The Envoy to Varlamore, by Deryk Paulson. You already have a copy.~|~translationMissing
The Envoy to Varlamore, by Deryk Paulson. You don't have room to take a copy.~|~translationMissing
The Envoy to Varlamore, by Deryk Paulson. You take a copy.~|~translationMissing
You climb down into the cave.~|~translationMissing
You squeeze through the crevice.~|~translationMissing
You attempt to cross the stepping stones.~|~translationMissing
If the player succesfully crosses~|~translationMissing
You successfully make it to the other side.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not succesfully cross~|~translationMissing
You slip and fall into the water.~|~translationMissing
Crikey!~|~translationMissing
You manage to swim back to the shore.~|~translationMissing
If the player successfully crosses the rocks~|~translationMissing
You climb over the rocks.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not successfully cross the rocks~|~translationMissing
You climb down the rope.~|~translationMissing
Artur Hosidius~|~translationMissing
Hello. I wasn't expecting to see anyone else down here.~|~translationMissing
Are you Artur Hosidius?~|~translationMissing
That's me. Who are you?~|~translationMissing
I'm [player name]. Your father sent me to find you. He's worried about you.~|~translationMissing
He really shouldn't worry, I'm fine. I'll head home as soon as I've finished here.~|~translationMissing
Well could I help speed things along in some way? I promised him I'd get you home.~|~translationMissing
Now that you mention it, I could use some help. There's a chest in the next cave with something important in it. It's got a big snake guarding it though.~|~translationMissing
By something important do you mean the Royal Accord of Twill?~|~translationMissing
How do you think I found you?~|~translationMissing
Oh. Well as you already seem to know, yes I'm here looking for the Royal Accord of Twill. I think it's in that chest, but the snake is in the way. Could you kill it for me?~|~translationMissing
Can't you do it yourself?~|~translationMissing
I tried, but I'm not very good at fighting.~|~translationMissing
Typical. Fine, I'll kill the snake. Just wait here.~|~translationMissing
Have you killed that snake yet?~|~translationMissing
The sooner you kill it, the sooner I can head home.~|~translationMissing
It's dead.~|~translationMissing
Great. Now we just need to empty that chest. Would you mind?~|~translationMissing
Fine. Wait here.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the royal accord~|~translationMissing
You have already recovered the Accord.~|~translationMissing
You do not have enough inventory space to loot this chest.~|~translationMissing
You search the chest and find the original Royal Accord of Twill.~|~translationMissing
I've emptied that chest.~|~translationMissing
I found the Accord.~|~translationMissing
Great! Hand it over then.~|~translationMissing
Not yet. You'll get it once you've returned home.~|~translationMissing
Eugh. Fine, I'll go home. But you'd better not run off with the Accord.~|~translationMissing
Why do you want the Accord anyway?~|~translationMissing
Why wouldn't I want it? The signing of the Accord marked the start of a golden age. Once the Royal Lords replaced the Council of Elders, Kourend prospered like never before.~|~translationMissing
But that was a long time ago. Why does it matter now?~|~translationMissing
Because I think it's time for another golden age. The Kourend Council, like the Council of Elders before them, have failed to do a good job in running this kingdom.~|~translationMissing
And you think the five houses would do a better job?~|~translationMissing
What makes you say the Council have done a bad job?~|~translationMissing
More crime. Fewer homes. More illness. Loss of jobs. The list goes on.~|~translationMissing
But aren't the five houses partially to blame as well? They rule the cities.~|~translationMissing
The Council sets the laws and the Council sets the budgets. We have to do as they say, just like everyone else.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, fair enough. Anyway, we'd better get off.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. Now let's be off.~|~translationMissing
I won't. Now let's get going.~|~translationMissing
You climb up the rope.~|~translationMissing
You climb up the sand pile.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Artur.~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name]. Thanks for your help in recovering the Accord.~|~translationMissing
You should talk to my father. He will probably want to reward you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for bringing Artur home safe.~|~translationMissing
Good day sir. On behalf of the Hosidius family, I thank you for bringing Artur home.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for finding our son. You've done this kingdom a great service.~|~translationMissing
It's no...~|~translationMissing
I do wonder if his father could have done more though. My brother would have had the entire army out searching.~|~translationMissing
Your brother...~|~translationMissing
My brother is Lord Shiro Shayzien. He commands the Shayzien Army. A luxury my husband doesn't have.~|~translationMissing
So you...~|~translationMissing
Maybe it doesn't always have to be that way. Things may well soon be different. Now be on your way, I have things to do.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Artur is safely back home again. I hear we have you to thank for that.~|~translationMissing
All in a days work.~|~translationMissing
He also said that you managed to recover the original copy of the Royal Accord of Twill.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the accord in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I did. I don't have it with me though.~|~translationMissing
Well go fetch it and bring it here.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the accord in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I did. I assume you'll be wanting it.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'll make sure it's well looked after. Now as for that reward I promised.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about yourself.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about your plans.~|~translationMissing

Hello adventurer, what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
What's that cute creature wandering around?~|~translationMissing
Oh Izzie? He's my pet.~|~translationMissing
What kind of creature is Izzie?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. He's very cute though don't you think? It's very restful having a pet, especially when you are stuck in a cave for as long as I am!~|~translationMissing
So, what do you do down here anyway?~|~translationMissing
Isn't that obvious? I investigate Thaumaturgy, I research the Arcane, I attempt to explain the inexplicable.~|~translationMissing
You study magic then, what kind of magic? I do a bit of magic myself you know.~|~translationMissing
Are you a budding mage? I can tell you more about my research if you'd like.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that sounds fascinating...~|~translationMissing
Excellent, it's so rare I can find someone to discuss my researches, most gnomes seem to find it all very tedious.~|~translationMissing
Never. How could they think that? Though, I suppose gnomes aren't known for their magic.~|~translationMissing
Well that's true. These days, apart from a few combat spells most gnomes seem to be a bit suspicious of mages.~|~translationMissing
Really? Why is that?~|~translationMissing
Well there is a bit of history there, do you want me to tell you about it?~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes I love a bit of History.~|~translationMissing
Very wise, a good knowledge of the History of Magic is crucial to understanding the Arcane.~|~translationMissing
Well, the most famous Gnomish Mage of all got into a bit of .... trouble.~|~translationMissing
Most gnomes don't really talk about him. Other than telling stories about him as if he was some sort of boogie-man.~|~translationMissing
Ridiculous! He was a gnome like any other - he sounds like a fascinating character.~|~translationMissing
He was one of King Healthorg the Great's advisors during the Grand Migration. But he was exiled after the Goblin Wars.~|~translationMissing
Why was that?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm not really sure. This was all before I was born - and no-one talks about what happened to Glouphrie these days.~|~translationMissing
He must have done something very bad then.~|~translationMissing
Well, maybe? I'm not so sure. As it happens I've been looking into that part of our History. All I've managed to establish was that he was particularly interested in optics and light magic.~|~translationMissing
It's hard to see what he could misuse light in a way that would get him exiled.~|~translationMissing
Well, indeed. I have also found though he was generally disliked by other gnomes - his moniker was 'Glouphrie the Untrusted'.~|~translationMissing
Oaknock the Engineer and Glouphrie didn't like each other either...~|~translationMissing
Oaknock? I haven't heard of him before.~|~translationMissing
Ah, Oaknock was an engineer and architect. Very famous. There are statues to him around the place - his reputation amongst gnomes is second only to King Healthorg himself. He built most of the Stronghold you know.~|~translationMissing
Are you really interested in all of this? Do you want to see something interesting?~|~translationMissing
Start the The Eyes of Glouphrie quest?~|~translationMissing
Well, have a careful look around at everything in the next cave and come back and tell me what you find.~|~translationMissing
Errm, not right now. I'd better go.~|~translationMissing
Fine! Humans really do prefer to live their lives in ignorance...~|~translationMissing
I'm more interested in your researches right now.~|~translationMissing
Gah! Young mages these days. No patience. No perseverance. Magic is not a toy or a shiny weapon you know! You cannot alter reality unless you understand it. And you cannot understand unless you search for the true causes of things. And history is a record of the causes of things.~|~translationMissing
I stand corrected - tell me more.~|~translationMissing
Actually I'd better get going...~|~translationMissing
Well, I'd better carry on with my research then..~|~translationMissing
Err, maybe some other time.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I need to mine some rune essence.~|~translationMissing
We were discussing gnome magic...~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes indeed. Well I do have a little mystery for you. Has your curiosity been piqued?~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm a bit busy right now.~|~translationMissing
Fine, wander blindly on then!~|~translationMissing
I've had a look in the other room now.~|~translationMissing
So? What did you find?~|~translationMissing
There was a pit with a crystalline looking bowl in the centre.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, sadly I know very little about that, it looks elven to me though...~|~translationMissing
There is also a large strange looking machine...~|~translationMissing
That's right. It was built by Oaknock.~|~translationMissing
That room used to be Oaknock's workshop. I'd also recognise his style anywhere.~|~translationMissing
I have no idea. But I do know someone who might.~|~translationMissing
There is one gnome left who knew Oaknock, and King Healthorg and Glouphrie for that matter...~|~translationMissing
Who is that?~|~translationMissing
Have a guess.~|~translationMissing
Errm....~|~translationMissing
Well, King Narnode tells me you've already visited him...~|~translationMissing
Oh I know, you're talking about Hazelmere aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Very good, young apprentice.~|~translationMissing
Didn't he help create the Grand Tree?~|~translationMissing
That's right. He was the third advisor to King Healthorg, he found and tended to the Grand Tree.~|~translationMissing
If you are really interested in all of this, then could you do me a favour and visit Hazelmere for me? I've been meaning to go for a while, but I have responsibilities here - there's always someone who wants to use the Rune Essence mines.~|~translationMissing
Of course, I'd love to!~|~translationMissing
Good! Good!~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute, am I going to have to translate everything he says using that dictionary again?~|~translationMissing
Ha! He's an old fashioned kind of gnome and doesn't like visitors much. But I'm sure he'll want to talk about the Old Days.~|~translationMissing
But he only speaks Ancient Gnomish!~|~translationMissing
That may be true, though he may just be faking it to deter visitors. Either way - he is a wise old gnome. If he really wants to talk to you I'm sure he'll find a way.~|~translationMissing
Well alright, if you say so. What do you want me to ask him?~|~translationMissing
Well ask him if he knows anything about Oaknock's machine. And anything you can find about Glouphrie would be very interesting, wouldn't you agree?~|~translationMissing
Right then. I'd better be on my way. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
So where do I find this Hazelmere chap then?~|~translationMissing
So haven't you managed to have a chat with Hazelmere yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet I'm afraid. Where do I find him again?~|~translationMissing
He has a hut in a small island east of Yanille. It has a lovely sea-view, I'm jealous. I love my cave, but it's not very picturesque.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you need some pictures. Though your pot plant adds something to ambiance of the place.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's not my potplant. I think it was Oaknock's.~|~translationMissing
Really? It's survived a long time. It must be a special pot plant.~|~translationMissing
I suppose it must be. It shakes every now and again you know... I don't know why.~|~translationMissing
How very odd. Anyway, I'd better get on my way to Hazelmere... See you soon.~|~translationMissing
Err, hello Hazelmere.~|~translationMissing
Blah blah blah human. Sarko!~|~translationMissing
Brimstail has sent me to ask you some questions.~|~translationMissing
Ha! Atarischeray! Blah blah mesi blah blah.~|~translationMissing
I have some questions about the old days. Brimstail has been filling me in about Gnomish History.~|~translationMissing
Blah Brimstail blah blah human blah minahar!~|~translationMissing
It sounds like a fascinating time. It also sounds like some important things happened then. Events that we shouldn't forget.~|~translationMissing
Hmmph. Laquinay blah human. Blah blah blah.~|~translationMissing
He has also found a machine - he says it was built by Oaknock...~|~translationMissing
Oaknock! Ha blah blah minapor blah blah blah.~|~translationMissing
Blah blah blah blah Oaknock blah blah blah.~|~translationMissing
Blah blah blah blah.~|~translationMissing
Blah blah blah blah Healthorg cinqo blah blah blah.~|~translationMissing
Erm, I'm sorry I don't understand a word you're saying.~|~translationMissing
*SIGH* Ipmesi human.~|~translationMissing
The camera closes in as Hazelmere casts a mind spell on the player's head.~|~translationMissing
You feel very strange - as if Hazelmere has started poking around in your head.~|~translationMissing
And yet everything seems a lot clearer.~|~translationMissing
Hmph. Not bad for a human.~|~translationMissing
You can hear Hazelmere's voice in your head, but he's not moving his lips. Very strange. You understand what he's saying though, which is a bonus.~|~translationMissing
Weird! How are you doing this Hazelmere?~|~translationMissing
Old magicks beyond your skill human. You can stop flapping your big human lips as well. Just think.~|~translationMissing
So how do I do this. Wow. That's impressive.  Brimstail was telling me that Gnomes don't trust Mages these days. Can you hear me? Glouphrie wasn't it? He did something bad and got exiled. Ooh, I'm feeling a little dizzy. You knew him didn't you? What can you tell me about him? And what's this machine that Oaknock built? Isn't that magical as well? Do you know what it does?~|~translationMissing
Stop wittering on [player name]. You're giving me a headache.  This mind speech is hard enough without having to listen to your incoherent babbling. Think about nothing. Clear your mind.~|~translationMissing
Clear my mind? Hey, how did you know my name.~|~translationMissing
I'm reading your mind foolish human. How do you think?  Now CLEAR YOUR MIND...~|~translationMissing
How do I think about nothing? I'll give it a go.~|~translationMissing
Hmm tasty lobster. Gah! I'm thinking about something. Stop thinking about Lobsters. Pink Lobsters. Big Lobsters. Lobsters with wings. Wings? Lobsters don't have wings. ARRGH. I can't do this.~|~translationMissing
Just shut up and listen! I have a story to tell you that will answer most of your questions.~|~translationMissing
Let us travel back in time, to the time you humans call the Fourth Age. King Healthorg had become King. The elves mysteriously decided to travel west, leaving most of Kandarin open for conquest. The humans weren't here yet, only King Healthorg and the gnomes to the north, and a collection of Goblin tribes to the south.~|~translationMissing
A map appears showing armies (flags) advancing towards each other~|~translationMissing
Both armies moved to claim the lands, and were of course destined to meet in battle...~|~translationMissing
A flashback begins, visually showing the battle between gnomes and goblins.~|~translationMissing
And so it came to pass the Goblins and Gnome armies met at the battle of Atarisundri.~|~translationMissing
Both sides faced each other on the Battlefield. A bloody battle was in prospect, our gnomes were brave, but we were no match for the mass of brute goblin stupidity...~|~translationMissing
... but Glouphrie and King Healthorg had devised a plan...~|~translationMissing
... If you don't lead an invincible army - pretend you do...~|~translationMissing
Glouphrie begins casting a spell.~|~translationMissing
Glouphrie~|~translationMissing
Em Gal lauf rei!~|~translationMissing
Emeto Laufolly egramentos umesco lamiten gan!~|~translationMissing
A large group of tortoises appear behind the gnomes.~|~translationMissing
And so, Glouphrie created an army of illusory Giant tortoises, knowing that goblins would be scared of anything bigger than they were.~|~translationMissing
Goblin 1 (unnamed)~|~translationMissing
Big Boss didn' say nuffin 'bout de nomiez havin' monsta tortisses!~|~translationMissing
Goblin 2 (unnamed)~|~translationMissing
Dey be huges! Tortisses too scary and pointy. We runz away!~|~translationMissing
The two goblins flee the battle, soon followed by others.~|~translationMissing
Goblin 3 (unnamed)~|~translationMissing
Scarey tortisses! Runz!~|~translationMissing
Goblin 4 (unnamed)~|~translationMissing
Runz away!~|~translationMissing
The flashback ends.~|~translationMissing
Hey! Was that you next to the tortoise? You look so handsome!~|~translationMissing
Handsome! Hmph! That was a long time ago...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, where was I? Oh yes...~|~translationMissing
Sadly, the golden times were not destined to last for long...~|~translationMissing
There was once a very special Spirit Tree in the Stronghold. Silver as a birch, old and wise - I considered him a friend. I called him Argento, his true name was unpronouncable.~|~translationMissing
He was the first Spirit Tree I had befriended, and the one I knew the best. I would sometimes travel, visiting and finding other Spirit trees, and during one such trip, I was filled with a great sense of foreboding...~|~translationMissing
Another flashback about Argento, the silver-coloured spirit tree, begins.~|~translationMissing
I felt a shadow pass over me, and a tingling in the air, even though the weather was fine and dry.~|~translationMissing
A large shadow appears and passes over the spirit tree.~|~translationMissing
Then I felt a sudden pain, as if the Anima Mundi was crying out with the loss of a favoured child...~|~translationMissing
A lightning bolt strikes Argento, splitting him in half.~|~translationMissing
And I knew that one of the Old Ones had died, and I had lost a friend.~|~translationMissing
I rushed straight back to the Grand Tree, only to find that no-one had noticed anything, and that Argento was still standing and seemed alive. But I knew something was wrong. He refused to talk to me and his aura was no longer present.  Someone had hidden his death.  I talked to Oaknock and he was incensed.  He immediately blamed Glouphrie, and although Oaknock could be rather irrational when it came to Glouphrie - they never saw eye to eye - I knew he was right this time.  Glouphrie had used his magicks to hide the truth from all of us.~|~translationMissing
Oaknock had made a machine - an anti-illusion machine, with some help from the elves.  He prepared it, and summoned the advisors to Argento..~|~translationMissing
A final flashback shows King Healthorg, Oaknock, Glouphrie and Hazelmere in front of an apparently intact Argento.~|~translationMissing
King Healthorg~|~translationMissing
Why have you summoned us here?~|~translationMissing
Oaknock the Engineer~|~translationMissing
You'll see sire. Switch the machine on!~|~translationMissing
The anti-illusion machine is activated, revealing the true state of the Silver Spirit Tree.~|~translationMissing
What is the meaning of this?~|~translationMissing
The Silver Spirit Tree is dead!~|~translationMissing
Glouphrie has been using his foul arts to mask the truth! What other secrets has he been keeping?~|~translationMissing
The King turns to Glouphrie.~|~translationMissing
Explain yourself!~|~translationMissing
Glouphrie the Untrusted~|~translationMissing
I live to serve you sire. I work for the good of us all.~|~translationMissing
How can lying to your fellow gnomes be 'Good'?~|~translationMissing
Some things are best kept secret...~|~translationMissing
Even from your King!?~|~translationMissing
Occasionally.~|~translationMissing
Enough! How can I trust a gnome who hides things from me?~|~translationMissing
No gnome can blame you for what you do not know.~|~translationMissing
That is NOT how I rule.~|~translationMissing
Glouphrie. You are no longer my advisor. Leave this place.~|~translationMissing
Only the naive believe they can rule without someone like me.~|~translationMissing
Your empire will crack and the gnomes will become but a joke.~|~translationMissing
Sarko!~|~translationMissing
So be it. I'll be watching.~|~translationMissing
And so Glouphrie left and travelled with some companions to a place they called Arposandra. We have heard nothing but rumours about them since...~|~translationMissing
So where's this Arposandra place anyway?~|~translationMissing
Nobody knows for certain, somewhere rocky I suppose. The rumour is that after founding his new home, Glouphrie used his magicks to shroud the city in mist. Arposandra may not exist at all, however I suspect that Glouphrie is still around, one way or another.~|~translationMissing
Why do you think that?~|~translationMissing
Just call it Gnomish intuition.~|~translationMissing
So the machine that Brimstail has found is the one that Oaknock built to stop Glouphrie's illusions.  Do you know how it worked?~|~translationMissing
I never studied it, but I believe it used elven magic - So it must have used crystals of some sort. Crystal discs, yes that sounds familiar.  Actually come to think of it I think I may have one lying around.  Here take this, maybe it will help you.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Violet pentagon.)~|~translationMissing
Well, thank you, Hazelmere. You've told me a lot of things I need to ponder for a while.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Oh and when you see that lazy toad Brimstail, tell him next time he needs information to come himself.~|~translationMissing
I'll do that. Farewell.~|~translationMissing
What do you want now? Go and talk to Brimstail, that's why you came to see me in the first place...~|~translationMissing
Oh yes...~|~translationMissing
I've visited Hazelmere, he told me all sorts of interesting things.~|~translationMissing
Ah, thank you my young apprentice. What did he tell you?~|~translationMissing
You tell Brimstail everything Hazelmere told you - Brimstail takes lots of notes.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene shows a near-invisible gnome sneak by Brimstail and the player as they discuss.~|~translationMissing
So the machine emits an anti-illusion glamour?~|~translationMissing
Glamour? What's that?~|~translationMissing
Don't you know anything? *sigh* A glamour is a type of enchantment or magical effect.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes it does have such a glamour. It seems to use crystal discs to work in some way.~|~translationMissing
You show Brimstail the disc Hazelmere gave you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, crystal discs? I may have a few of those in a drawer somewhere.~|~translationMissing
What's that? Something just moved behind you...~|~translationMissing
The gnome destroys the machine.~|~translationMissing
Really? Wait - what's that banging noise?~|~translationMissing
Brimstail and the player hurry up to the other room~|~translationMissing
What's happened to the machine? It's broken!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, something is afoot.  I sense sabotage....~|~translationMissing
The machine is broken, I suspect sabotage...!~|~translationMissing
This is intolerable! How could this happen?~|~translationMissing
I'm confused, it must have happened while we were here talking!~|~translationMissing
But we were just standing here, how could someone get past us?~|~translationMissing
I did see something odd behind you...~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute, how did the saboteur know about the machine?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm ... You're the only person I've told about the machine...~|~translationMissing
Hey! Don't look at me like that. The only person I've talked to is Hazelmere.~|~translationMissing
Surely this couldn't be the work of Hazelmere... That turncoat!!~|~translationMissing
Wait! Wait! None of this makes any sense. There must be another explanation.~|~translationMissing
Alright. Someone snuck in here without us noticing.How?~|~translationMissing
The intruder must have been invisible.~|~translationMissing
Right, and how does one make oneself invisible my boy?~|~translationMissing
Illusion magic?~|~translationMissing
Invisibility is a form of illusion magic. So that makes sense...~|~translationMissing
So this was done by Glouphrie? Is he still alive?~|~translationMissing
Who knows, but he may well have taught the skills to his gnomes.~|~translationMissing
You mean the gnomes that went with Glouphrie to Arposandra?~|~translationMissing
Right. And why would they sabotage an anti-illusion device?~|~translationMissing
Because there is an illusion that they want to remain hidden?~|~translationMissing
Of course. Which makes it imperative that we fix this machine and find out what it is!~|~translationMissing
Have a look at the machine and assess the damage. I'll hunt around my boxes and see if I can find anything that might help.~|~translationMissing
Something's happened to the machine! It's broken!~|~translationMissing
Have you had a look at the damage yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'll get right to it.~|~translationMissing
I think I've fixed the machine now!~|~translationMissing
Well done! You're almost as good at fixing things as a gnome! Who'd have thought?~|~translationMissing
Though I still don't think it's actually activated. There appears to be some sort of lock on the front. I think I know what the discs are for though. There's a slot in the front that looks like it might fit a disc, and a number.~|~translationMissing
So what do you think the number means?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should put a disc into the slot and see what happens?~|~translationMissing
That reminds me, I found those crystal discs I mentioned before.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Red square and Yellow triangle.)~|~translationMissing
They are not quite the same as the one Hazelmere gave you, but they look similar in size and weight.~|~translationMissing
They also look as if they might fit in the slots on both of the machines. Maybe I should try it out?~|~translationMissing
I wonder if the different sizes and shapes mean anything.~|~translationMissing
I've been thinking that as well, I shall ponder it some more.. I'll work it out.~|~translationMissing
That's the spirit! This is all good training for the mind...~|~translationMissing
I can't work out what to do with these discs!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Maybe all of these discs all have different values and you have to choose the right one in order for it to work?~|~translationMissing

Ali Morrisane~|~translationMissing
Good day and welcome back to Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
My name is Ali Morrisane - the greatest salesman in the world.~|~translationMissing
Are you really the greatest salesman in the world?~|~translationMissing
If you're the greatest salesman in the world, why are you still selling goods from a stall?~|~translationMissing
Well one can only do and sell so much. If I had more staff I'd be able to sell more, rather than wasting my time on menial things. I could get on with selling sand to the Bedabin and useless tourist trinkets to just about~|~translationMissing
everyone else.~|~translationMissing
I'm too busy to help. Adventuring is a full time job you know!~|~translationMissing
No problem my friend, perhaps another time.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, have a look at my wares.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm really too busy.~|~translationMissing
(Ali's Discount Wares. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
I'd like to help you, but...~|~translationMissing
I'd like to help you but...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I know, I know - the life of a shop keeper isn't slaying dragons and wooing damsels, but it has its charms.~|~translationMissing
Although perhaps you can help me some other way. A nephew of mine lives not too far from here in a little town called Pollnivneach. He was supposed to become my assistant, but he hasn't shown up. If you fetch him~|~translationMissing
here I'll give you the first month of his salary!~|~translationMissing
If the player has a combat level less than 40~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended level of 40.~|~translationMissing
Start The Feud quest?~|~translationMissing
I'll find your nephew.~|~translationMissing
But you had better become the greatest merchant in Gielinor once I succeed!~|~translationMissing
Ah, many thanks, my friend. My nephew's name is Ali and he lives to the south in a town called Pollnivneach.~|~translationMissing
Tell him his uncle Ali M needs his help up in Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
And while you're here, have a look at my wares.~|~translationMissing
So what are you selling then?~|~translationMissing
I sent you to learn the whereabouts of my nephew, Ali. Is there any word of him in Pollnivneach?~|~translationMissing
That's not really the news I was hoping for.~|~translationMissing
But since you've been gone trade has gotten even busier. Will you have a look at my wares?~|~translationMissing
Ali the Mayor~|~translationMissing
Welcome, adventurer, to the town of Pollnivneach, the gateway to Menaphos and Al Kharid. My name is Ali and I'm the mayor of this town. I hope you enjoy your stay here.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. That is one of the warmest welcomes I've ever had! People generally treat travelling adventurers with suspicion.~|~translationMissing
All are welcome here. Now more than ever I suppose.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean by that?~|~translationMissing
There's trouble in town, and a lot of villagers have left as a result. Things are looking dire.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for someone called Ali.~|~translationMissing
Well, take your pick!~|~translationMissing
I mean I'm looking for a specific Ali. He's Ali Morrisane's nephew.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that Ali! Well, er, your best bet is to ask around town. I'm sure someone will know what he's up to.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Camel Man~|~translationMissing
Welcome to my discount camel store. Can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
A discount camel store?~|~translationMissing
Yes - it's my great idea - selling camels at discounted prices so that the common man can experience the joys of owning a camel of their very own! They're not just a source of kebab meat you know!~|~translationMissing
So can I buy a camel then? I'm hungry!~|~translationMissing
I would never sell one to the likes of you! They are beautiful, majestic creatures, not food! Get out of my shop.~|~translationMissing
Yes, camels are beautiful creatures.~|~translationMissing
Ah, wondrous camels! Best of all Saradomin's creations. Ships of the desert, far more useful than any horse or donkey. Truly, they are a man's best friend.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you'd like a camel of your own? You're in the right place, if so...~|~translationMissing
Well yes, actually I would like to ask about something else.~|~translationMissing
No, but thanks for your time.~|~translationMissing
Why would I want a camel? All they do is spit and...~|~translationMissing
Pah! I've seen mummies with more brains than you! If you treat camels badly then of course they're going to spit at you. May your robes never be clean again!~|~translationMissing
Actually, I think I was a camel in a previous life.~|~translationMissing
You're teasing me now! You rogue!~|~translationMissing
Everyone laughs at the poor Discount Camel Seller.~|~translationMissing
So is the discount camel business good then?~|~translationMissing
Business is booming! Pollnivneach has never seen this number of visitors.~|~translationMissing
In fact I'm thinking of expanding and trying to break into the camel hire market.~|~translationMissing
If only I could figure out how to get people to return the camels...~|~translationMissing
Tell me about this town.~|~translationMissing
Well, Pollnivneach is a funny little place. It's a small town and you'd think it'd be nice and quiet.~|~translationMissing
But those Menaphites and bandits are making the place quite unbearable.~|~translationMissing
In what way?~|~translationMissing
Well, one group is as bad as the other! They steal, they fight, they cause trouble with us locals. Just yesterday one of those bandits came looking for protection money!~|~translationMissing
Why don't the authorities stop this?~|~translationMissing
We're a small town. We don't have the resources to keep the gangs off our backs! Menaphos and Al Kharid are no help either.~|~translationMissing
To tell the truth we live in hope that an outsider, someone with no ties to either group, could broker a deal to halt the hostilities between them.~|~translationMissing
Well the weak will always be trodden on. Why not stand up to them?~|~translationMissing
That's a little unfair, my friend. We can't all be brave adventurers. If we were, where would you purchase quality camels at discounted prices?~|~translationMissing
You might think about that. Anyway, isn't it the job of the brave adventurer to protect the weak and innocent from evil and harm?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I could help.~|~translationMissing
Yes, perhaps you could.~|~translationMissing
You know the politics better than I do. What do you recommend?~|~translationMissing
Me?! I am but a humble discount camel seller. You're the adventurer, don't you know what to do?~|~translationMissing
Of course I know what to do! I was just testing you!~|~translationMissing
That is reassuring to hear. Too often one meets brainless adventurers whose solution to every problem is to hack, maim and murder.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad to know you're not of that ilk.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I should know, but offered advice should never be shunned.~|~translationMissing
The state of adventurers today. They need everything spelled out for them.~|~translationMissing
What, you want me to put a little note in your quest journal?~|~translationMissing
But fine, I'll give you a hint. Try and see if you can get the gangs to agree to a truce by offering them each a token gift as an act of reconciliation.~|~translationMissing
If that fails to work, you must consider trying to influence the gangs from within.~|~translationMissing
Lovely day isn't it?~|~translationMissing
It's a beautiful day today, but word has it that it will rain tomorrow.~|~translationMissing
No! When have you ever known it to rain here in Gielinor?~|~translationMissing
Oh. Anyway...~|~translationMissing
Are those camels around the side for sale?~|~translationMissing
Those two camels around the side are already sold.~|~translationMissing
I've got new stock coming very soon though. Come back later if you're still interested.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Ali from Pollnivneach.~|~translationMissing
Well, you've found your man.~|~translationMissing
Really? Do you have an uncle called Ali?~|~translationMissing
Why yes - all my uncles are called Ali!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear! Do any of them own a stall in the Al Kharid Bazaar?~|~translationMissing
Well no, but one of them owns a moderately successful camel hire franchise.~|~translationMissing
Have you considered hiring a camel? Or perhaps purchasing one of your own? I can get you a discount.~|~translationMissing
Street urchin~|~translationMissing
What do you want? Information?~|~translationMissing
What would you know?~|~translationMissing
No one knows what's going on in the streets better than me. I live, sleep, eat and drink here. The fact that I'm so small means that people tend to ignore me which helps even more.~|~translationMissing
Do you need any other information?~|~translationMissing
Yes tell me about...~|~translationMissing
Yes, tell me about...~|~translationMissing
The Menaphites~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Menaphites.~|~translationMissing
They're a bad bunch, always starting fights down in the Asp and Snake. Word on the street is that they're led by some deranged priest. Nobody's ever seen them though - they do all their deals through Ali 'the~|~translationMissing
Operator'. I reckon they're up to something, but they're such a close knit group that little ever slips out.~|~translationMissing
The bandits~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the bandits.~|~translationMissing
There's not much to say, really. They're just a group of local thugs led by the biggest and strongest amongst them. If they have any other plans, I don't know about it.~|~translationMissing
The Mayor~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Mayor.~|~translationMissing
The mayor is a spineless coward! He never stands up to anybody. That's why the Menaphites are so strong now! He let them stay, and then they started causing trouble. When he realised his mistake, he hired a band~|~translationMissing
of local thugs to drive them out, but they saw how weak he was and turned on us too. Now we've got bandits and Menaphites, and the mayor isn't doing anything!~|~translationMissing
Ali Morrisane's nephew~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Ali Morrisane's nephew.~|~translationMissing
I know him! He used to kick us when he caught any of us stealing from his stall.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where he is now then?~|~translationMissing
He disappeared a little while ago. All I know is it had something to do with the gangs. Probably he scammed them. You'd have to gain their trust to find out more, m'afraid - if I get too close, they might disappear me~|~translationMissing
too!~|~translationMissing
The town~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the town.~|~translationMissing
It's boring! We're not as big as Menaphos or as powerful as Al Kharid, and we've got a really nasty crime problem. It's no wonder so many grown-ups have left.~|~translationMissing
Come back if you need any info about anything in the town.~|~translationMissing
I will do thanks.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Barman~|~translationMissing
Good day. Can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd like a drink please.~|~translationMissing
(The Asp & Snake Bar. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
What's going on in town?~|~translationMissing
Nothing much really. About what you'd expect from a sleepy little town like ours.~|~translationMissing
What about those two gangs? That seems exciting.~|~translationMissing
They're paying customers, so I won't rock the boat if you don't mind.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'm ok.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'm ok. Thanks for your time.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd like to talk about something else.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm called Ali and I'm from here. Are you looking for me?~|~translationMissing
Do you have an uncle called Ali?~|~translationMissing
Yes! All my uncles are called Ali!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. Well do any of your uncles have a stall in the Bazaar in Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
Well do you know if anyone here does?~|~translationMissing
That's a difficult question to answer. I don't know anyone else's uncles.~|~translationMissing
The 'Asp and Snake'? What a strange name for a bar.~|~translationMissing
Maybe around these parts. Were you expecting it to have 'Ali' in the name?~|~translationMissing
I did think about calling it 'Ali's', but then it'd get confused with the Camel Shop, the Kebab House, the Mayor's residence...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I get your point. It's a perfectly fine name.~|~translationMissing
Drunken Ali~|~translationMissing
Ahh, a kind stranger. Get this old man a drink so that he may wet his throat and tell you of the strange happenings in this town.~|~translationMissing
Now where were we? Ah yes, Ali Morrisane's wayward nephew.~|~translationMissing
What?! How did you know that's who I was looking for?~|~translationMissing
Er... well, he's a real scamp, that lad! I can't imagine a stranger would be asking after anyone else.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. Well go on then, where is he?~|~translationMissing
I'd tell you more, but my throat is drying up. This desert climate is an inhospitable one. Get me another beer so that I can continue my tale.~|~translationMissing
Get this poor, thirsty old man another drink so that he may wet his lips and continue.~|~translationMissing
You are too kind, now what were we talking about?~|~translationMissing
Ali Morrisane's nephew.~|~translationMissing
Of course! I've known him since he was a wee lad. A right little mischievous beggar...~|~translationMissing
Yes, I can imagine. Do you have any more recent information about him? Where is he?~|~translationMissing
Well now, if you had just asked me that in the first place I would have told you directly!~|~translationMissing
You're right, I'm sorry for beating around the bush. Do you know where Ali's nephew is now, though?~|~translationMissing
Alas, my throat has dried up, and I cannot speak... perhaps another drink would help?~|~translationMissing
Ahh, that hits the spot.~|~translationMissing
Now which of you two adventurers wanted to know where Ali's nephew is?~|~translationMissing
I think you're seeing double.~|~translationMissing
Is this a double? No wonder I feel sick...~|~translationMissing
Look, all I want to know is the whereabouts of Ali Morrisane's nephew.~|~translationMissing
Now is that his nephew from his side or his wife's? They have a huge family you see. I remember...~|~translationMissing
No, no, no. Stop right there. You are not going to fool me into buying you another beer without first giving me some useful information.~|~translationMissing
But my lips are so dry, how can I possibly continue?~|~translationMissing
Well if your lips are dry, I'll have to wring you like a wet cloth and squeeze out enough booze to fill another tankard. I'd reckon it would hurt though.~|~translationMissing
I see. Don't worry about me, I'll just have to soldier on. Now what do you want to know?~|~translationMissing
For the last time, where is Ali Morrisane's nephew?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't know.~|~translationMissing
Seriously?~|~translationMissing
Wait, wait! The last I heard he was in trouble with those gangs hanging around town. You won't get any answers out of them, though, not while they're feuding. Maybe if you were to solve that little problem...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, is there any chance of another beer?~|~translationMissing
What do you think?~|~translationMissing
What were we talking about again? Yes yes, when I was a boy... no, that's not it.~|~translationMissing
Eh? What's this? I don't want that, get me a beer.~|~translationMissing
Bandit~|~translationMissing
I am trying to get to the bottom of this feud between you and the Menaphites.~|~translationMissing
What's it to you?~|~translationMissing
I'm just trying to understand why thieves of your repute would stoop to their level.~|~translationMissing
Well, if memory serves me correctly, I think the hostilities began when they robbed one of our camels. A heinous crime.~|~translationMissing
So if they offered a camel back as a gesture of goodwill, would you and the rest of the bandits cease your hostilities?~|~translationMissing
Those Menaphites would never do that. They have no sense of honour.~|~translationMissing
But if they did?~|~translationMissing
Cowardly Bandit~|~translationMissing
I am trying to figure out the feud that exists between you and the Menaphites.~|~translationMissing
Nothing much, I'm trying to understand why thieves of your repute would stoop to the level of the Menaphites.~|~translationMissing
Well if memory serves me correctly. I think my granddad mentioned that they robbed one of our camels. A heinous crime.~|~translationMissing
So if they offered a camel as a gesture of goodwill would you and the rest of the bandits cease your hostilities?~|~translationMissing
Menaphite Thug~|~translationMissing
I am trying to figure out the feud that exists between you and the Bandits.~|~translationMissing
Not much to figure out there, the problem is those thieving bandits.~|~translationMissing
They are always stealing, starting fights and disrupting the lives of the townsfolk.~|~translationMissing
Word has it that the Menaphites are also involved in unsavoury behaviour.~|~translationMissing
Well, we also steal, start fights, and disrupt lives - but we do it with class! And the bandits definitely started it.~|~translationMissing
How did 'they' start it?~|~translationMissing
I can scarcely remember, it's been so long.~|~translationMissing
Go on try.~|~translationMissing
I think our leader once mentioned that they robbed one of our camels. A heinous crime around these parts.~|~translationMissing
So if they offered a camel as a gesture of goodwill would you agree to cease hostilities?~|~translationMissing
Those bandits would never agree to that. They couldn't afford even the mangiest excuse for a camel, never mind the desert traversing, four legged beauty that we would demand.~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose so.~|~translationMissing
Maybe if I got both gangs a camel, I could use the mutual good will to find out what happened to Ali's nephew.~|~translationMissing
But you are in luck - I have another two beautiful camels arriving soon from the best stable in all of Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Although another two ugly camels would have been fine, I think.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me a little about them?~|~translationMissing
Well Sandy, the female camel, is a placid beast. At 20 years of age she comes from a prestigious line of camels - her mother was part of the Emir's baggage train!~|~translationMissing
Lumps, on the other hand, is a 15 year old male. He's a bit surly and prone to bouts of stubbornness. However, he more than makes up for this failing with his immense strength and stamina.~|~translationMissing
Both of them are of the 'Camelus Horribleus' family, a rare breed only found in this area of Gielinor. It is...~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok, that's enough! They're camels, I get it.~|~translationMissing
What price do you want for both of them?~|~translationMissing
One cannot put a price on these beauties, they are precious beyond the worth of the crass value of gold coins!~|~translationMissing
So can I have them for free then?~|~translationMissing
Are you trying to be funny?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I could make another offer?~|~translationMissing
Would 200 gold coins for the pair of them do?~|~translationMissing
Pah! That might buy you a mangy, flea-infested sheep if you're lucky. Don't insult me.~|~translationMissing
Would 500 gold coins for the pair of them do?~|~translationMissing
Without two empty inventory spaces~|~translationMissing
I would consider giving them to you if you were able to look after them. But it is abundantly clear that you've got your hands - and your inventory - full at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Without enough gold~|~translationMissing
You don't even have that much money do you? Come back when you're able to make a proper offer and stop wasting my time.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I can silence my moral objections for that.~|~translationMissing
Ali the discount camel seller gives you a receipt for the camels in return for 500 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
Here are the receipts for the camels, so that you can pick them up as soon as I get them in.~|~translationMissing
Would 1000 gold coins for the pair of them do?~|~translationMissing
Would 1,000 gold coins for the pair of them do?~|~translationMissing
You are too generous. I would have sold them for half of that!~|~translationMissing
Ali the discount camel seller gives you a receipt for the camels in return for 1,000 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
Hello! Welcome back to my discount camel store. How are those camels getting along?~|~translationMissing
About those camels. I've lost the receipt. Can I have another?~|~translationMissing
About those camels. I've lost the receipt, can I have another?~|~translationMissing
If the player has both receipts~|~translationMissing
I think you're trying to con me into giving you an extra receipt.~|~translationMissing
Come back to me when you're not so burdened.~|~translationMissing
No problem, There you go.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Camel Man gives the player any missing receipts.~|~translationMissing
I decided to get rid of the camels.~|~translationMissing
Why? did they not please you?~|~translationMissing
No, they didn't. I sold them as Kebab meat!~|~translationMissing
Nooooo! Not Sandy and Lumps! You beast! Get out of my shop this instant!~|~translationMissing
I'm not really a camel person, so I gave them to a better owner.~|~translationMissing
That's very responsible of you. Too many people let their camels run feral through the desert, instead of sending them to happy homes.~|~translationMissing
You want to watch out for those feral camels, you know.~|~translationMissing
I decided to try and use them to end the hostilities between the two gangs.~|~translationMissing
A noble purpose for two noble beasts! Did you succeed?~|~translationMissing
Still working on that, I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
Well, I wish you the best of luck.~|~translationMissing
Good news, the bandits have agreed to give you a camel in order to restore peace.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a receipt~|~translationMissing
So where's the camel?~|~translationMissing
Um... I'll get back to you on that.~|~translationMissing
You hand the doorman a sales receipt for the camel.~|~translationMissing
A mere receipt? For a discount camel? I knew those bandits were cheap! Tell them that we have changed our minds and demand 10 camels in return for our mercy.~|~translationMissing
Oh no... why do I bother?~|~translationMissing
Good news, the Menaphites have agreed to give you a camel in order to restore peace.~|~translationMissing
You hand the guard a sales receipt for the camel.~|~translationMissing
What's this? A mere promise of a camel? From a discount camel store? I knew those Menaphites were cowards. Tell them that we have changed our minds and demand 10 full-price camels in return for our~|~translationMissing
mercy.~|~translationMissing
The camel approach doesn't seem to be working. Perhaps I should be more direct and try to join one of the gangs.~|~translationMissing
Really? I knew they were cowards. Tell them that we have changed our minds and demand 10 camels in return for our mercy.~|~translationMissing
Ahhh why do I bother!~|~translationMissing
I really can't chat for very long, the recent escalation in crime has me run off my feet. There are muggings and burglaries happening in broad daylight! It's really not on.~|~translationMissing
Good day adventurer. Have you come with the Menaphite peace offering?~|~translationMissing
Umm... no. Not yet. Actually I've come to ask about something else.~|~translationMissing
We can talk once you bring back the Menaphites' full peace offering.~|~translationMissing
Greetings Adventurer, Ali wants to have a word with you.~|~translationMissing
Really? Which one?~|~translationMissing
Ali, our Chief of Operations. He should be somewhere nearby the tent.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Operator~|~translationMissing
You seem to be a man of action. We could do with more people like you to sort those despicable bandits out.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, those pesky bandits!~|~translationMissing
So will you join us in our fight to wipe them out?~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course, those bandits should be taught a lesson.~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course, those pesky bandits should be taught a lesson.~|~translationMissing
Good choice my friend, together we will crush them.~|~translationMissing
So when do we start?~|~translationMissing
Slow down, slow down. First you must prove yourself capable and trustworthy.~|~translationMissing
How will I manage that?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about that, I'll just set you a few jobs to do.~|~translationMissing
As you might have gathered we have a less-than- sparkling reputation around here.~|~translationMissing
So I want you to foster this reputation and grow it.~|~translationMissing
What exactly does that mean?~|~translationMissing
It means that I want you to go out into the town and pickpocket three villagers, then report back to me.~|~translationMissing
If you have any problems don't be afraid to ask for some advice.~|~translationMissing
Oh right, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Yes I'd like to ask you about something else.~|~translationMissing
That information is available on a need to know basis and right now, you don't need to know.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the other people in the town.~|~translationMissing
Sheep, ready for the slau... hang on. I shouldn't be telling you that. Just forget I said anything.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Ali.~|~translationMissing
Can you be a bit more specific? Everyone here is called Ali.~|~translationMissing
So I noticed. Well, he has an uncle called Ali Morrisane, a market vendor in Al Kharid. That's all I really know about him.~|~translationMissing
Say no more. I know just the Ali you mean - that little snake robbed me too! If we work together perhaps we can catch him and teach him a lesson.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps later, I'm quite busy at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Tell me when you are ready. This deed should not be undertaken lightly.~|~translationMissing
How is the pickpocketing going?~|~translationMissing
I haven't started yet. I'm still psyching myself up to it.~|~translationMissing
Don't take all day, time is getting on and there are still plenty of foul deeds to be done.~|~translationMissing
Get out of here, you Menaphite dog!~|~translationMissing
What was that? Are you looking for a fight.~|~translationMissing
Me? No, no, I was just, er, complimenting your, that is - don't kill me, please!~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't waste my time.~|~translationMissing
Tumeken be praised, you have seen the error of your ways. May Elidinis the river goddess bless your lands.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if I could ask you about something.~|~translationMissing
You're better off asking Ali the Operator. He's the brains behind the whole operation.~|~translationMissing
Villager~|~translationMissing
I know your tricks, thief.~|~translationMissing
You won't get my purse.~|~translationMissing
Villager hits the player for 2 damage and a stun.~|~translationMissing
How is the pickpocketing going? Need a hand?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I could do with a bit of advice.~|~translationMissing
If you can't achieve your goal directly, try adding another element into the equation, like a distraction.~|~translationMissing
Do you know what I mean?~|~translationMissing
Nah, no problems here. I want to ask you about something else.~|~translationMissing
Nah no problems here. I actually wanted to ask you about something else.~|~translationMissing
Hey kid, come here!~|~translationMissing
I need a little help, do you want to make some easy money?~|~translationMissing
That depends.~|~translationMissing
Do you see that villager over there? If you could distract him for a bit I'll give you 10 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
If a villager isn't in distance~|~translationMissing
Listen, you're crazy. I can't see anyone to distract.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I see them. Here I go!~|~translationMissing
Hey you, camel features! Come here.~|~translationMissing
Hey there!~|~translationMissing
Did you see the way I distracted that guy? Man, I'm one smooth operator!~|~translationMissing
You did good, kid.~|~translationMissing
So where's my money?~|~translationMissing
What money?~|~translationMissing
Don't play stupid with me, I'm better at it. Where's my money?~|~translationMissing
Oh, that money! I don't think you deserve it!~|~translationMissing
Liar, thief!~|~translationMissing
How observant of you!~|~translationMissing
Give me my money!~|~translationMissing
Make me!~|~translationMissing
You'll be sorry!~|~translationMissing
Here you go, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Thanks sir, I didn't think you would hold up your side of the deal. There's not much honour amongst thieves, you know.~|~translationMissing
Well do you need any other information then?~|~translationMissing
Thief! Thief!~|~translationMissing
Shut up! Don't cause any more trouble or you'll regret it.~|~translationMissing
Give me double and I'll be quiet!~|~translationMissing
Okay, here you go - you thief.~|~translationMissing
Better a thief than a liar!~|~translationMissing
Hi! Do you want to go rob some more people? I could do with some more money.~|~translationMissing
Okay, let's do it again.~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Some overhead dialogues with the Street urchin and villager edit)~|~translationMissing
I think I need to try a different tactic. Sorry, kid!~|~translationMissing
Well do you need any information then?~|~translationMissing
Having problems?~|~translationMissing
The distraction tactic isn't working any more?~|~translationMissing
No, they seem to have figured that one out already.~|~translationMissing
It is a small town, news spreads fast. Perhaps using a spot of cunning and a bit of brute force might work better.~|~translationMissing
Here, take this, it might help.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Operator motions as if to give you a Blackjack but you decline, as you have no room in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the blackjack~|~translationMissing
I've already given you a Blackjack, try using it.~|~translationMissing
Ali The Operator hands you a Blackjack made out of oak.~|~translationMissing
No problems here. I actually wanted to ask you about something else.~|~translationMissing
Psst. Come here, I want to show you something~|~translationMissing
It's a surprise! Follow me.~|~translationMissing
Well done! You have finished your first trial.~|~translationMissing
First trial?~|~translationMissing
You didn't think we'd hire you off the back of a couple of pick-pocketings, did you?~|~translationMissing
Ah, of course not.~|~translationMissing
Good! Now, the next thing you have to do is a spot of burglary.~|~translationMissing
The only place worth pilfering around here is the mayor's villa.~|~translationMissing
I want you to retrieve his wife's jewels.~|~translationMissing
Got any advice?~|~translationMissing
Well I think that a disguise would be a good start. After that I would stake out the place to make sure he's not in.~|~translationMissing
You'll need a key to the front door, too.~|~translationMissing
I can't carry anything else.~|~translationMissing
Well then come back to me again when you are ready. Don't be too long.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Operator hands you a set of keys.~|~translationMissing
No! Now get going.~|~translationMissing
Haven't I helped you enough already?~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm still having problems getting in.~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the keys~|~translationMissing
So you've lost your keys then. It's lucky I keep a spare pair.~|~translationMissing
So what's the problem? Have you created a disguise yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes of course.~|~translationMissing
Then make sure that you stake the place out to make sure neither the mayor or his family are inside.~|~translationMissing
Now that you mention it, I'm having a few problems with that.~|~translationMissing
Now that you mention it, yes I am having problems with the disguise.~|~translationMissing
You'll have to create something that will hide your hair and obscure your facial features.~|~translationMissing
Make sure you're wearing a pair of gloves so that you don't leave any incriminating finger prints.~|~translationMissing
You should have all this equipped before you stake out the house.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing gloves~|~translationMissing
I need something to cover my hands before I stake out the house. I might leave fingerprints.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing a desert disguise~|~translationMissing
I need something to disguise my head before I stake out the house. Somebody might spot me.~|~translationMissing
I better be careful, this cactus is prickly!~|~translationMissing
The coast is clear, nobody's home.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the keys~|~translationMissing
I've lost the keys you gave me.~|~translationMissing
It's lucky I keep a spare pair.~|~translationMissing
I've managed to stake the place out. What should I do now?~|~translationMissing
Try using those keys I gave you to open the door!~|~translationMissing
You hear a satisfying click as the door unlocks.~|~translationMissing
I've managed to break in, but I'm unable to get the jewels.~|~translationMissing
Then search the house more thoroughly! Everything you need should be there.~|~translationMissing
You find an interesting note on the desk.~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough room in your inventory to take it.~|~translationMissing
Note (numbers) is added to the player's inventory.~|~translationMissing
You find a flattened note under the mattress.~|~translationMissing
Note (Fibonacci) is added to the player's inventory.~|~translationMissing
On the wall hangs a rather nondescript picture. On closer inspection you notice that it's covering something~|~translationMissing
a safe.~|~translationMissing
Safe interface opens.~|~translationMissing
Upon failing the combination~|~translationMissing
A rather loud clank reverberates from the safe. It sounds as if you've gotten the combination wrong. You wonder how many more attempts you have before the safe permanently locks itself.~|~translationMissing
Upon unlocking the safe~|~translationMissing
The mayor's jewels are contained within the safe, however you have no room in your inventory to take them.~|~translationMissing
You remove the jewels from the safe.~|~translationMissing
I really can't chat for very long, the recent escalation in crime has me run off my feet. Just a short while ago even my own house was robbed. This cannot continue.~|~translationMissing
I've completed your task.~|~translationMissing
Impressive, I didn't expect you to crack that safe so quickly. Did you have help?~|~translationMissing
Of course not, although the mayor did leave a number of hints lying around.~|~translationMissing
That man is a fool. Now give me the jewels.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the jewels~|~translationMissing
Actually I seem to have misplaced them.~|~translationMissing
You are trying my patience. Hurry back with the jewels. Don't disappoint me.~|~translationMissing
You hand Ali the Operator the jewels.~|~translationMissing
Now, your final task is one of the upmost importance. It has come to my attention that there is a traitor in our midst.~|~translationMissing
Yes, and I want you to root them out.~|~translationMissing
Because I feel like I can trust you. You don't have the emotional baggage that comes with playing the villain your entire life.~|~translationMissing
You can count on me to find out.~|~translationMissing
Aw! You can count on me to find the traitor.~|~translationMissing
Well then get to it.~|~translationMissing
How is the search for the traitor going?~|~translationMissing
Still no breakthrough.~|~translationMissing
Make sure you interview our other members. They may know more than they let on.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you could help me?~|~translationMissing
Tell me what your problem is and I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
I've heard there's a traitor among the Menaphites. What do you know about it?~|~translationMissing
It wasn't me, I swear!~|~translationMissing
Really? So what do you know?~|~translationMissing
I just can't believe one of my friends could be a traitor.~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose there is Traitorous Ali.~|~translationMissing
'Traitorous Ali'?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. The most untrustworthy, backstabbing little rat to scamper across Tumeken's fair desert. He'd sell his own mother to slavers if he hadn't already betrayed her and had her locked up for the last job he pulled.~|~translationMissing
I suppose the name is a bit of a giveaway.~|~translationMissing
That was a little too simple, are you sure it was him?~|~translationMissing
Positive, he was turned by the offer of a set of waterproofs and a ride on a camel.~|~translationMissing
I see he drives a hard bargain.~|~translationMissing
Well what can I say? We don't call him 'Ali of the Good Decisions', do we?~|~translationMissing
I have discovered the identity of the traitor. It was...~|~translationMissing
Traitorous Ali!~|~translationMissing
No! I would never have suspected Traitorous Ali.~|~translationMissing
Well, there was that time he sold out his entire family for a sandpit and an umbrella.~|~translationMissing
But I'm sure it took much more for him to betray us!~|~translationMissing
Actually he sold you out for...~|~translationMissing
Stop, I don't want to know. It hurts too much already. Find him and then kill him, but do it quietly. I don't want a fuss.~|~translationMissing
Is the deed done?~|~translationMissing
Well don't waste time talking to me. Get on with it.~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Traitorous Ali.~|~translationMissing
He was just here! Look, he's even left his drink on the table by those barrels. Must have nipped out to go to the toilet.~|~translationMissing
He might be gone a while though. The nearest outhouse is all the way over on Fossil Island.~|~translationMissing
Good day, Hag.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Hag~|~translationMissing
Good day to you too, Blockhead.~|~translationMissing
Now what do you want? A hex? A spot potion? Power, beauty, eternal youth, etcetera?~|~translationMissing
Actually I just want your help to, erm, remove someone. It's simple enough!~|~translationMissing
Ahh, I see. But I warn you, stranger - extinguishing the flame of life is simple, but people rarely wish to face the consequences, and I doubt you are any different.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about the consequences - I need it carried out in a manner which would draw no suspicion to me.~|~translationMissing
Well now this is getting interesting. I'd recommend a poisoning. Who do you wish dead? I need to know so that I may tailor a poison to their specific needs.~|~translationMissing
'Traitorous Ali', please.~|~translationMissing
Traitorous Ali? Say no more! That wretch traded his grandmother's house for a jar of pickled aubergines! I believe he'll be easily gotten rid of...~|~translationMissing
What payment do you require?~|~translationMissing
None at all - I will extract much pleasure from his passing. Just bring me the ingredients I require.~|~translationMissing
Ah, impatience! Traitorous Ali's time is indeed nigh. Firstly bring me some snake venom, which will act as the main toxin.~|~translationMissing
Where would I get some snake poison?~|~translationMissing
From a snake perhaps?~|~translationMissing
What I meant was how do I extract the poison from the snake?~|~translationMissing
Sheesh! You'd make a terrible hag. Just bring me a snake with teeth in its head - and don't even think of giving me that snake charmer's pet worm, it's about as dangerous as a rubber knife.~|~translationMissing
Have you got a snake yet?~|~translationMissing
No, I'm still working on that.~|~translationMissing
Well don't bother me again until you do!~|~translationMissing
I have the snake. What else do you need?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, that snake will do nicely. Hello, you wriggly little cutie!~|~translationMissing
Who's a vindictive little beast? You are! You are!~|~translationMissing
Erm, yes. Do you need anything else?~|~translationMissing
Now that I have the toxin I need something to hide its trace. Fresh camel dung should do the job.~|~translationMissing
What? That's disgusting.~|~translationMissing
Do you want the poison or not?~|~translationMissing
Fine, fine, I'll get some camel dung.~|~translationMissing
And make that fresh camel dung! Nice and stinky. Now hand over that venomous little darling before it takes a bite out of you.~|~translationMissing
Oops! I almost forgot!~|~translationMissing
You hand the basket with the charmed snake over to the old hag.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the camel dung yet?~|~translationMissing
Well don't come back until you have it!~|~translationMissing
Here's your poison!~|~translationMissing
Wow, that was quick!~|~translationMissing
Actually I already had it brewing. I just needed the ingredients for another batch.~|~translationMissing
You wouldn't believe the demand. It's been murder!~|~translationMissing
That's not even remotely funny.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I've been dying to say that for ages.~|~translationMissing
Just stop. Thanks for the poison and good day to you.~|~translationMissing
Wait! Just remember, this poison isn't designed to be used on a weapon. In fact it's not a contact poison at all. You'll have to do more than just smear it on a blade!~|~translationMissing
Got it. Thanks again!~|~translationMissing
You hand over your bucket of fresh camel dung and receive a vial of poison in return.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if I could have another batch of poison?~|~translationMissing
Why? Was the first batch not good enough?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Hag's poison in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Well no, I was just being greedy and wanted another batch for no good reason.~|~translationMissing
Well if that's the case, no! I have better things to be doing than continuously brewing poisons for people who have no use for it.~|~translationMissing
I lost the first batch.~|~translationMissing
What? How do you just lose a batch of the most potent poison in all of Gielinor? It's even more deadly than the jungle karambwan.~|~translationMissing
It's a long and not very interesting story.~|~translationMissing
Well alright, I'll give you another batch this once.~|~translationMissing
(The player receives another Hag's poison.)~|~translationMissing
You poison the drink.~|~translationMissing
Have you good reason to disturb me again?~|~translationMissing
Nope!~|~translationMissing
I warned you about needlessly bothering me. That's it! I'm turning you into a frog!~|~translationMissing
Ribbit, ribbit!~|~translationMissing
Don't taunt me, fool! Once I find a spare minute you'll be ribbiting on the other side of your face, you mark my words!~|~translationMissing
Almost, his drink is poisoned. As soon as he gets back, he'll be done for.~|~translationMissing
Excellent work! Now, go speak with our boss.~|~translationMissing
He wants to discuss the future direction of the gang.~|~translationMissing
What did the boss say?~|~translationMissing
I haven't spoken with him yet.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Operator said you wanted to see me.~|~translationMissing
Menaphite Leader~|~translationMissing
That's right. I have kept a close eye on your progress. I'm impressed.~|~translationMissing
So what are your plans for the bandits?~|~translationMissing
The bandits? A mere nuisance, insignificant to my overall goal.~|~translationMissing
Wait, if you're not warring with the bandits, what are you planning?~|~translationMissing
World domination! First Pollnivneach, then Al Kharid, then the whole of the desert!~|~translationMissing
You do understand who we are, don't you?~|~translationMissing
Actually I thought you were a ragtag band of good-for- nothing thieves sucking the life out of this innocent town.~|~translationMissing
Silence! We are the descendants of assassins, the heirs of the revolutionaries who defeated the corrupt pharaoh and his brood!~|~translationMissing
For centuries we have wandered the desert, rebuilding the empire we were promised!~|~translationMissing
Will you join us in our quest to defeat the thralls of Tumeken and reclaim our birthright?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I have this irrational hatred for megalomaniac, despotic zealots! Prepare to meet your maker, you big jerk!~|~translationMissing
Fool! You'll never get to me. Guards protect me.~|~translationMissing
The Menaphite Leader summons the Tough Guy to attack the player.~|~translationMissing
You treacherous jackal! Prepare to die!~|~translationMissing
The Menaphite Thug attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
Guards!~|~translationMissing
Tough Guy~|~translationMissing
You haven't seen the last of me!~|~translationMissing
Menaphite Leader teleports away.~|~translationMissing
No doubt I haven't seen the last of you... but what about Ali's nephew?~|~translationMissing
Maybe the villagers will feel more talkative now that I've rid them of these evil Menaphites. Who knows, they might even give me a reward!~|~translationMissing
You treacherous jackal! I should never have trusted you.~|~translationMissing
What can I say, you live and learn.~|~translationMissing
I will avenge my master!~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I think I have a fair idea of what is going on in the town now.~|~translationMissing
I don't know what we did to deserve your presence here, but I for one am filled with regret.~|~translationMissing
Well that's some show of gratitude! Can't I even get a 'thank you' for ridding your town of one of the gangs?~|~translationMissing
Do you understand the concept of consequences?~|~translationMissing
Er, I think so?~|~translationMissing
Well, the consequences of your little piece of butchery are that the town is now even worse off. The bandits no longer have to waste time and energy fighting with the Menaphites and can direct all their attention~|~translationMissing
towards making us miserable. So for your efforts I thank you, but I wish no-one had asked for your help.~|~translationMissing
I'll set this town right before I leave, I promise.~|~translationMissing
Why do I wish that you hadn't said that? Your heavyhanded tactics scare me.~|~translationMissing
Welcome! Your actions surprise me.~|~translationMissing
It was brilliant the way you got rid of the Menaphite leader.~|~translationMissing
Er... yes. Thank you.~|~translationMissing
So will you run the rest of them out of town now?~|~translationMissing
Welcome. Our leader would be pleased to congratulate you on your disposal of the Menaphites who plagued this town.~|~translationMissing
Why did you have to go and ruin everything? We had a beautiful future ahead of us, the town would have been ours!~|~translationMissing
Maybe I wanted to make it MY town!~|~translationMissing
I see. I knew the hunger for power would get to you eventually.~|~translationMissing
Evil megalomaniacs set on destruction should be opposed.~|~translationMissing
Really? I thought you were meant to follow those types blindly, with unquestioning loyalty.~|~translationMissing
Look, Gielinor is full of power mad evil-doers. I'm sure another will come along soon enough.~|~translationMissing
No... it just wouldn't be the same. I think I'll just wallow in self pity for a while.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. Can we still be friends?~|~translationMissing
No, I think I'll just wallow in self pity for a while.~|~translationMissing
You!You're the one that just made everything worse for us poor villagers!~|~translationMissing
What?! I just single-handedly took apart one of the gangs that was ruining your town!~|~translationMissing
You adventurers! You never think, you just act. You think that by killing a powerful bad person, Gielinor will become a better place.~|~translationMissing
It's not that simple, things never are. You've created a vacuum, and now all that power will go to whoever's strong enough to take it.~|~translationMissing
Who do you think is stronger? Our elderly mayor, or the leader of the bandits?~|~translationMissing
Oops. Sorry, I was just trying to help. So are things really that much worse?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Before your intervention the two gangs pretty much cancelled each other out. They spent most of their energy trying to kill each other.~|~translationMissing
Now that the balance is lost, the Bandits reign unopposed! They no longer have to deal with the Menaphites and heap misery upon misery on us. You must finish the job that you have started.~|~translationMissing
You know, this adventuring lark is a lot more complicated than I thought!~|~translationMissing
If you're prepared to change something you must also be prepared to deal with the consequences! Now hurry up and fix this mess you created!~|~translationMissing
What do you mean by fix the mess I created?~|~translationMissing
Do I have to spell it out to you?~|~translationMissing
Would you please?~|~translationMissing
Just run the bandits out of town. Incidentally, I spotted their leader to the north-west just a few minutes ago.~|~translationMissing
Ok I'll get to it.~|~translationMissing
Welcome! Our leader wants to congratulate you on your swift disposal of the Menaphites who plagued this town.~|~translationMissing
Bandit Leader~|~translationMissing
Come here my friend, so I may embrace you. You have done us a great turn by disposing of those Menaphites.~|~translationMissing
Don't jump to conclusions, I didn't do it for you.~|~translationMissing
Regardless, I am still very grateful. Now I have the town at my mercy.~|~translationMissing
That's what I'm here to talk to you about.~|~translationMissing
Do you want a reward? A fee? I will not begrudge you that.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm here to give you an ultimatum~|~translationMissing
either leave the town of your own free will or I will make you.~|~translationMissing
How the worm has turned. This no-name adventurer who was robbing, looting and poisoning not too long ago is now taking the moral high ground! Or are you trying to keep the whole town for yourself?~|~translationMissing
Pollnivneach is mine. You won't run me out without a fight. If you want us gone, you must defeat our strongest warrior in battle.~|~translationMissing
Start packing your bags!~|~translationMissing
Bandit champion appears.~|~translationMissing
Bandit champion~|~translationMissing
Grrr~|~translationMissing
Bandit champion appears~|~translationMissing
Ali, come here!~|~translationMissing
I have defeated your champion, now get out of town.~|~translationMissing
Adventurer... I have underestimated you. Perhaps we can come to an agreement. How about I work for you? Think of the riches you would make.~|~translationMissing
Don't try my patience. Tell me where Ali is, and then get out of here?~|~translationMissing
Ali? Which Ali?~|~translationMissing
Ali Morrisane's nephew! I know you gangs had something to do with his disappearance, so tell me where he is!~|~translationMissing
Ali Morrisane?! You fool. You've been had!~|~translationMissing
Go have a chat with these precious townspeople of yours. You'll soon learn the truth.~|~translationMissing
I'll go talk to a villager now, just to prove you wrong. Now get out of here before I really get angry with you!~|~translationMissing
I told you to clear off! Why are you still here?~|~translationMissing
Don't try my patience. Get out of here, and never return to this town again!~|~translationMissing
Ha! You fancy yourself the people's champion, do you? You are so naive. You don't even realise you've been tricked!~|~translationMissing
Go have a chat with these precious townspeople of yours. You'll soon see.~|~translationMissing
I'll go talk to a villager now, just to prove you wrong. Now get out of here before I really get angry with you.~|~translationMissing
You dog! You killed our champion and for that you will die!~|~translationMissing
The Bandit attacks the player.~|~translationMissing
You dog! You killed our champion and for that I hope you die a slow and painful death.~|~translationMissing
What was that? Are you looking for a fight?~|~translationMissing
Now are you satisfied?~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you again!~|~translationMissing
I have delivered you from two evil tyrants. Where's my thank you?~|~translationMissing
Thank you? For what? You come into our town. You rob, mug, burgle and kill and then expect respect and gratitude? Look, if it's praise and thanks you're looking for, talk to the mayor.~|~translationMissing
I wonder why I bother sometimes! This place has been nothing but trouble and I still haven't found Ali's nephew.~|~translationMissing
My thanks, adventurer. Your methods and motives may be questionable, but none can argue that you have delivered our little town from the wicked gangs who plagued it. I think things will change around here, now~|~translationMissing
that our problems are at a manageable size.~|~translationMissing
The least that I can do for you is answer your questions about the whereabouts of Ali Morrisane's nephew. He always was a mischievous young man, full of harebrained schemes.~|~translationMissing
He dreamed of being the greatest salesman in all of Gielinor! Unfortunately, he was a little too good.~|~translationMissing
He angered a number of people by coercing them into buying things they didn't really want. Completely within the law, of course, but the law could only protect young Ali for so long.~|~translationMissing
Once he angered the Menaphites and the bandits, I knew I could no longer protect him.~|~translationMissing
Under cover of darkness I smuggled him out of the town, and he's been gone ever since.~|~translationMissing
I can assure you, however, that he is safe and well - and now that you have effectively ended the threat posed by the gangs, he can continue his business elsewhere. Last I heard he planned to open some kind~|~translationMissing
of trade network with forty of his friends. A 'treasure trove', he claims. I'll believe it when I see it.~|~translationMissing
I hope that helps you in your quest. If you speak to Ali Morrisane, do tell him that I wholeheartedly apologise for the way he - er, his family - has been treated.~|~translationMissing
I think I may be able to help with one other thing. I heard that your house was burgled recently. If you're interested in recovering the goods, you ought to have a word with Ali the Operator.~|~translationMissing
Now, how would a passing adventurer know where to find my missing jewels?~|~translationMissing
Er, let's just put it down to adventurer's intuition.~|~translationMissing
Thank you once again. Have you spoken to Ali Morrisane yet?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you should! I'm sure he's keen to hear word of his nephew.~|~translationMissing
Well since you gave the two gangs a good kicking, business has really taken off! Both gangs are spending all their gold here drowning their sorrows.~|~translationMissing
That's great! So do I get a cut of the profits?~|~translationMissing
Get out of here, you cheeky rascal. A cut of my profits? As if!~|~translationMissing
Could you tell Traitorous Ali that someone has poisoned his drink?~|~translationMissing
What?! Poisoned drinks, in my bar?! My reputation would be destroyed if someone died here. Thank you adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Here, have a beer - it's on the house.~|~translationMissing
Ali the barman gives you a beer.~|~translationMissing
Thanks but no thanks, I don't drink.~|~translationMissing
Don't say that around here too loud please, it may catch and then I'd be out of business.~|~translationMissing
You could always open up a non alcoholic fruit juice bar. You'd have less problems with drunken customers~|~translationMissing
You might be onto something there, but then what would I do with the drunken sailor?~|~translationMissing
Drunken Ali. Oh never mind it's a long story.~|~translationMissing
Yuck! I don't like beer.~|~translationMissing
Fine, suit yourself. There's no need to insult me.~|~translationMissing
Hey Ali!~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Any news?~|~translationMissing
Not much really, I just want to thank you for what you have done for this town. I might even stick around now that business is better!~|~translationMissing
Any grand plans?~|~translationMissing
Well I've been debating whether I should diversify into camel rental, too. Although I do have all these cages lying around... do you think there's a market for discount jackals?~|~translationMissing
Maybe! Best of luck, in any case.~|~translationMissing
Hello again my friend. I have heard nothing from my troublesome nephew. Have you any news of his whereabouts?~|~translationMissing
Indeed I do. I was able to eventually learn of his fortunes, although it was a little bit more challenging than I originally thought.~|~translationMissing
Well then please, tell me what has become of him. Nothing bad I hope.~|~translationMissing
I was able to discover that he is quite the salesman. Perhaps too good. He has roughly forty people working under him.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately a number of people didn't approve of his sales techniques and as a result he is in hiding.~|~translationMissing
You make an old man very happy. I'm so proud of young Baba.~|~translationMissing
But he's considered a thief!~|~translationMissing
Yes, by people with too much money and not enough sense. All willingly parted with their money and received what they purchased.~|~translationMissing
Well, it seems I still am in need of an assistant...~|~translationMissing
..but take the reward anyway.~|~translationMissing
Ali Morrisane gives you 500 coins.~|~translationMissing
I've just been thinking Ali, there seems to be a few parallels between yourself and your nephew. Both of you are unscrupulous salesmen, both of you come from the same town and both of you no longer trade there.~|~translationMissing
Were you sent into exile too?~|~translationMissing
No, now hang on, this seems to me like one of the strangest quests I have ever been involved with. I do not believe that a businessman like you would not know of a competitor, particularly a competitor as talented as~|~translationMissing
your nephew.~|~translationMissing
So what was your motive to get me to visit Pollnivneach? Was it concern for the towns people? Hmm. I don't think so, I'd say you would probably sell your grandmother if you could get a good price for~|~translationMissing
her. What was the reason?~|~translationMissing
My my, you surprise me, you're not as dumb as you look.~|~translationMissing
No, this couldn't have just been a sales pitch to get me to buy a fake beard and headpiece, was it?~|~translationMissing
Ah, once again you underestimate me. I sold you far more than that.~|~translationMissing
Really? Well I did buy some other odds and ends off you.... no hang on! I get it now, you're in league with Ali the Camel seller, the Kebab seller and the mayor aren't you.~|~translationMissing
I like the word 'tourism'. Did you not enjoy your stay in Pollnivneach? Was there not action, intrigue and fun to be had, and did you not notice all the other tourists there too?~|~translationMissing
I must apologise for ever doubting you and your claims to be the best salesman in all of Gielinor.~|~translationMissing
Now that we both agree on that, may I show you my wares?~|~translationMissing

3.2 Returning to Lady Lovakengj~|~translationMissing
...and he says that it's of the greatest urgency.~|~translationMissing
Greatest urgency? I don't like urgency. This is quite simply not on.~|~translationMissing
Hiya!~|~translationMissing
Who is this human, Councillor Unkar? What are they doing here?~|~translationMissing
If the player doees not have the requirements to start the quest~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't know.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Could you make them go away?~|~translationMissing
Sorry human. We're currently engaging in important official business. You'll need to come back another time.~|~translationMissing
This is [player name]. They've been helping out in Lovakengj recently.~|~translationMissing
Well I've never heard of them. What do they want?~|~translationMissing
What do you want human?~|~translationMissing
Start The Forsaken Tower quest?~|~translationMissing
They're looking for a quest.~|~translationMissing
A quest? Well we don't have any of those lying around.~|~translationMissing
Well hang on. Maybe they could help us with this urgent matter.~|~translationMissing
What urgent matter?~|~translationMissing
The one we were just discussing. The one with the Doors of Dinh.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, the urgent matter with the Doors of Dinh. Very clever Councillor Unkar. You put the human to work. I need a sherry.~|~translationMissing
Human, we have a job for you.~|~translationMissing
Great. What do you need?~|~translationMissing
One of the finest smiths in Lovakengj, Undor, has been investigating issues with the Doors of Dinh. We've just received word that he has found the problem. However, he has requested we send assistance.~|~translationMissing
Could you go to him and see what help he needs? You'll find him right outside the Doors of Dinh, north of Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
I'm Councillor Unkar, one of the members of the Kourend Council. We are responsible for running the entire Kingdom of Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
What brings you to Lovakengj then?~|~translationMissing
It's important for the Council to maintain a good relationship with the rulers of the five cities. Although it is the Council that rules, we can only do so with their support.~|~translationMissing
I'm here to help Lady Lovakengj out and to make sure she has everything she needs to rule effectively.~|~translationMissing
What are the Doors of Dinh?~|~translationMissing
They are a great set of doors built by a legendary smith, Dinh, in the early days of Kourend. They were created to imprison a deadly beast known as the Wintertodt.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, although the Doors kept the beast contained for over a thousand years, they've recently started to fail. The master smith, Undor, was sent to investigate.~|~translationMissing
They don't want anything.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Could you make them go away then?~|~translationMissing
Sorry human. We're currently engaging in important official business. If you don't have anything of importance to say, you'll need to come back another time.~|~translationMissing
Human, we have given you a job to do. What else do you need?~|~translationMissing
Go and speak to Undor and see what he has discovered. You'll find him outside the Doors of Dinh, north of Arceuus.~|~translationMissing
Undor~|~translationMissing
Hello there [laddie/lass].~|~translationMissing
I've been sent to help you.~|~translationMissing
I just need to finish this little job. I'll be with you in a minute. While you're waiting, why not talk to that fiery lass? She'll fill you in on the situation here.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about the Wintertodt.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about the Doors of Dinh.~|~translationMissing
Have you now [laddie/lass]? I was wondering when they'd send someone.~|~translationMissing
Well here I am. What do you need?~|~translationMissing
They all kept saying that the Doors were failing and I kept telling them that was rubbish. Did they listen? Of course they didn't.~|~translationMissing
So the doors aren't failing?~|~translationMissing
Of course not! They were made by Dinh himself, the finest smith this world has ever seen. His work doesn't just fail!~|~translationMissing
But if the Doors aren't failing, what's the issue?~|~translationMissing
Sabotage!~|~translationMissing
Sabotage? That doesn't sound good.~|~translationMissing
You're right with that one [laddie/lass]. Someone or something has made a small hole in the Doors.~|~translationMissing
It's not much, but it's enough for that Wintertodt to be able to draw some power into the prison. Probably why them fiery lot have had so much trouble recently.~|~translationMissing
Repair the damage of course [laddie/lass]. Now I should be able to fix the issue no problem. The only thing I'm missing is the right tools. That's where you come in.~|~translationMissing
What tools do you need?~|~translationMissing
I require a hammer!~|~translationMissing
A hammer? Are you seriously telling me that you don't own a hammer?~|~translationMissing
What does it look like I'm holding you spoon?! I don't just need any hammer. I need the legendary hammer used by Dinh himself! It's the only tool capable of working this metal.~|~translationMissing
Ahh, I see. So where do I find this hammer?~|~translationMissing
Back in his prime, Dinh built a great tower. It was known as Dinh's Redoubt and it's where he created all of his finest inventions.~|~translationMissing
After Dinh died, some poncey mage thought they'd go and defile his tower. The place has been off limits ever since.~|~translationMissing
Now I don't know for sure, but I reckon that Dinh's Hammer might still be there.~|~translationMissing
Well there's only one way to find out. Where do I find this tower?~|~translationMissing
The Forsaken Tower, as it's now known, can be found west of Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll be back once I've found that hammer.~|~translationMissing
Have you got Dinh's Hammer yet [laddie/lass]?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. Where should I be looking?~|~translationMissing
I reckon it's somewhere in Dinh's Redoubt, or The Forsaken Tower, as it's now known. You'll find it west of Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
The display case is sealed. It contains an old ornate hammer made of some strange metal. There's a strange panel beneath the display case with some symbols on it.~|~translationMissing
There is an old generator crank in the crate. You take it.~|~translationMissing
It's an old steam generator. There's some fuel already in it but it needs cranking up to start it. However, the crank is missing.~|~translationMissing
You have a crank that can start the generator.~|~translationMissing
Start the generator.~|~translationMissing
You use the crank to start up the generator.~|~translationMissing
It's an old power grid. It's receiving power, but it is not aligned.~|~translationMissing
Align the power grid?~|~translationMissing
You successfully align the power grid.~|~translationMissing
There's some coolant jugs in the cupboard.~|~translationMissing
Take a 5-gallon jug.~|~translationMissing
You take a 5-gallon jug from the cupboard.~|~translationMissing
Take an 8-gallon jug.~|~translationMissing
You take an 8-gallon jug from the cupboard.~|~translationMissing
Take both.~|~translationMissing
You take a 5-gallon jug and an 8-gallon jug from the cupboard.~|~translationMissing
Leave them.~|~translationMissing
It's an old chemical refinery. It still seems to be in working order.~|~translationMissing
Activate the refinery?~|~translationMissing
You attempt to activate the refinery but nothing happens. A warning on the control panel reads 'Foreign objects detected, refinery must be cleansed.~|~translationMissing
Cleanse the refinery?~|~translationMissing
You pour the fluid into the refinery. The warning on the control panel disappears.~|~translationMissing
The display case contains an old ornate hammer made of some strange metal. You take it.~|~translationMissing
I have!~|~translationMissing
Well hand it over then.~|~translationMissing
Give Dinh's Hammer to Undor?~|~translationMissing
You give Dinh's Hammer to Undor.~|~translationMissing
Look at it! Such a work of art. Dinh never fails to impress. Now that I have this, it shouldn't take me long to fix the Doors.~|~translationMissing
Does this mean the Wintertodt won't be a threat anymore?~|~translationMissing
That should be the case in the long run. I suspect it will take a long time though. The Doors were damaged for a while and the Wintertodt will have gained a lot of power.~|~translationMissing
I reckon that magic lot will have to do their fiery tricks for a bit longer before everything is back to normal.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'll get to work fixing the Doors. You should head back to Lady Lovakengj and let her know that the problem has been solved.~|~translationMissing
Now that I have Dinh's Hammer, it shouldn't take me long to fix the Doors. You should head back to Lady Lovakengj and let her know.~|~translationMissing
The human seems a bit lost councillor. Could you help them please.~|~translationMissing
But I've done what you asked!~|~translationMissing
Oh. What did I ask?~|~translationMissing
We asked them to go and see what help Undor needed at the Doors of Dinh.~|~translationMissing
That we did councillor. Quite right. And what was it that Undor needed?~|~translationMissing
Undor had found some damage caused to the Doors of Dinh. He suspected someone had sabotaged them. He asked me to fetch him Dinh's Hammer so that he could fix the Doors.~|~translationMissing
I found the hammer and gave it to Undor. He should be fixing the Doors as we speak.~|~translationMissing
Well this is excellent news. With the Doors fixed, the Wintertodt poses a far smaller threat to Kourend. Well done.~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, wonderful stuff. I think I'll have a sherry to celebrate.~|~translationMissing
Councillor, why is the human still here?~|~translationMissing
I think they want a reward, Lady Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
A reward?~|~translationMissing
Yes, Lady Lovakengj.~|~translationMissing
Well here you go, have this then.~|~translationMissing
Oh. The human is still here.~|~translationMissing

9 The off-screen segment of the bard's ballad~|~translationMissing
Ask for a quest.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any quests?~|~translationMissing
As a matter of fact [Fremennik name], I do have a quest for you. Are you interested?~|~translationMissing
I'm ready for another adventure!~|~translationMissing
Excellent, now-~|~translationMissing
So what will it be this time? Joining warring islands?~|~translationMissing
I'm a fan of your enthusiasm, [Fremennik name], but-~|~translationMissing
Would you have me slay a mighty daggermouth? Or do you need my expertise in conquering untamed lands?~|~translationMissing
Nothing quite that fancy I'm afraid, [Fremennik name]. I just need you to investigate a minor disturbance.~|~translationMissing
Freygerd and Reeso run the sandpit a little north of here. They mentioned they heard some rustling by their hut last night and wanted an official to investigate.~|~translationMissing
You've proven yourself more than worthy of our people's trust.~|~translationMissing
Well that doesn't sound so bad. I'll get right on it.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Very well. Return when you wish to help.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the investigation.~|~translationMissing
How goes the investigation, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
I'm still looking into it at the moment.~|~translationMissing
No rush, [Fremennik name]. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Just talk to Freygerd and Reeso at the sandpit when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
Hello Reeso, I'm [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Reeso~|~translationMissing
Greetings, [Fremennik name]. I imagine the Chieftain sent you over. My wife, Freygerd, is probably the best person to speak to. She was the one who saw the... well whatever it was.~|~translationMissing
I looked about outside but couldn't see anyone out there.~|~translationMissing
I'll get to the bottom of it. Thank you Reeso.~|~translationMissing
Hello Freygerd, I'm [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Freygerd~|~translationMissing
Thank goodness you've arrived!~|~translationMissing
The Chieftain told me that you saw some sort of disturbance outside your hut?~|~translationMissing
Yes, my husband thinks I'm going a bit mad but I know what I saw! Red eyes, piercing with a terrifying stare. I was so frightened, I fell to the floor!~|~translationMissing
It was the middle of the night, so I couldn't make out what it was. But when I got back on my feet, it wasn't there anymore.~|~translationMissing
I see. I'll have a look around and see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for your help.~|~translationMissing
How's it going, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
Try not to worry too much, I'm sure it's nothing.~|~translationMissing
Have you looked around the hut yet, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
I still think I'm missing something. I'll let you know when I'm done.~|~translationMissing
Thanks again for your help. Make sure you bring anything you find back. I'll make sure my husband delivers it to the Chieftain.~|~translationMissing
You spot an object by the boxes but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You find what looks to be a venom gland.~|~translationMissing
This doesn't look safe... Good job my backpack magically stops things from breaking!~|~translationMissing
This seems to be a small sack filled with venom.~|~translationMissing
You spot an object by the rocks but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
You find some sort of fang.~|~translationMissing
It's dripping with venom. I'd better make sure I don't prick my finger!~|~translationMissing
This seems to be the fang of a relatively small creature. It's absolutely soaked in venom.~|~translationMissing
Basilisk youngling jumps out of the sand pit~|~translationMissing
Well I can honestly say I wasn't expecting that. Looks like it dropped a letter of some sorts. I'd better grab it.~|~translationMissing
I think I've found everything I need for this investigation. I should let Freygerd know.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Unsealed letter~|~translationMissing
I already have the letter from this sand pit.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the Unsealed letter and has no inventory space~|~translationMissing
You find an object in the sandpit but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the Unsealed letter~|~translationMissing
You find the letter you lost.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's where that letter went! How convenient.~|~translationMissing
I think I've found everything I need.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you'd better talk to the wife then. She'll want to know what you've discovered.~|~translationMissing
I've had a look around and found a few things I'd like to show the Chieftain. The thing that made the noise outside your home is gone now, so there's nothing to worry about.~|~translationMissing
Thank goodness! I'll have my husband take those items to the Chieftain for you.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, yeah... alright!~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much for your help, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
No problem. I best be getting back to the Chieftain!~|~translationMissing
Hello Reeso.~|~translationMissing
Greetings, [Fremennik name]. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
You didn't by any chance read that letter, did you?~|~translationMissing
The sand business is booming over here in Rellekka! I don't have time to worry about some letter.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for letting me know.~|~translationMissing
No problem, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Please, do tell me more about the sand business in Rellekka.~|~translationMissing
An adventurer like you? Don't you have anything better to do?~|~translationMissing
Not at all. I seem to have all day to talk to people. Why else would I start a conversation with you?~|~translationMissing
Well, being so close to the shore, Rellekka provides a lot of seaweed alongside my sand.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more!~|~translationMissing
Well I work for a business known as Sandy Sand Co. A brilliant bunch of people!~|~translationMissing
The seaweed from Rellekka, in combination with my sand business, provides a huge amount of glass for the surrounding areas!~|~translationMissing
Fellow Fremenniks aren't too pleased with my outside dealings, though know how important my job is. I think they let it slide for that reason.~|~translationMissing
Well, thank you so much for all of that information Reeso. See you later.~|~translationMissing
You didn't say, [Fremennik name]. What exactly was it that was outside? My husband didn't tell me what he took to the Chieftain for you.~|~translationMissing
Terrify her with all the details.~|~translationMissing
It was a basilisk.~|~translationMissing
I said it was a basilisk.~|~translationMissing
A basilisk?~|~translationMissing
Well I really must get back to what I was doing. Lovely to catch up!~|~translationMissing
Spare her the truth.~|~translationMissing
It was nothing to worry about! Just a couple of knick knacks probably dropped by some kids!~|~translationMissing
What about the red eyes I saw though?~|~translationMissing
They were probably just firestarters. That's what I found outside.~|~translationMissing
Well that's certainly a relief. Thank you for letting me know!~|~translationMissing
Not a problem!~|~translationMissing
A basilisk! In our town! This is how it starts!~|~translationMissing
How what starts?~|~translationMissing
The end!~|~translationMissing
Well that sounds cheery. You have nothing to fear though, not with me around. Speaking of which, I'd better get back to it.~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name], I'm glad you've returned! This letter you have found is very worrying and requires our utmost attention.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand. What does the letter mean? Who is the Jormungand? And since when could basilisks read and write?~|~translationMissing
While they may not show it, basilisks are much smarter than they seem. Many years ago, a great basilisk army enslaved our people and took our home.~|~translationMissing
The Jormungand, sometimes known as The Serpent King, was the leader of this army. Along with his three generals, Typhor, Vritra and Bakuna, he brought a terror to these lands unlike any other.~|~translationMissing
If it hadn't been for the bravery of a great hero, we might never have been freed.~|~translationMissing
A hero?~|~translationMissing
Yes. He was known as V. He stood up to the Serpent King and confronted him on the Island of Stone. It is said that the two of them fought for days, but in the end, V stood victorious.~|~translationMissing
What happened next?~|~translationMissing
Well that depends who you ask. The bards wrote a great song about V's victory. They called it the Ballad of the Basilisk, and it claims V killed the Jormungand.~|~translationMissing
Well... bards are known to bend the truth a bit, especially if it makes a song sound better. In reality, V sealed the Serpent King in a magical prison on the island, where he remains to this day.~|~translationMissing
A magical prison? I thought the Fremennik people didn't approve of magic?~|~translationMissing
V was different. Stories tell of how he unlocked the potential of magic with the single touch of a stone. In that moment, he became more than just a man.~|~translationMissing
A god?~|~translationMissing
It's not a distinction the Fremennik particularly care for. To us, he has always been a hero to be respected, not a god to be worshipped. They say he felt the same way.~|~translationMissing
But he earned the right to use magic?~|~translationMissing
Exactly. Now the Moon Clan on the other hand, did not earn that right. Their use of magic is an insult to our people.~|~translationMissing
So what can we do about the Jormungand?~|~translationMissing
We will stay strong, [Fremennik name]. We'll...~|~translationMissing
We'll be doomed!~|~translationMissing
Our army isn't large enough to hold back the forces of the Serpent King.~|~translationMissing
I can help!~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name], you're strong. But you're no army.~|~translationMissing
You're forgetting Brundt. We have the element of surprise! They don't know we're aware of their attack.~|~translationMissing
We could have days to prepare before they make their move. We could...~|~translationMissing
Cutscene starts with Agnar running in.~|~translationMissing
Agnar~|~translationMissing
Chieftain Brundt!~|~translationMissing
Agnar? What is it?~|~translationMissing
Chieftain Brundt! I'm here on behalf of the Fremennik Council! We've heard some disturbing news about a basilisk in town.~|~translationMissing
Well I won't deny there's been a little issue but [Fremennik name] and I will soon have things back under control.~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name]? When will you see that this outerlander is the cause of all of our problems!~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name] is no outerlander! He passed our trials and is a Fremennik, just like you and I.~|~translationMissing
You can disguise it all you want, but he is an outerlander and always will be! Ever since we let him in, we've had nothing but trouble!~|~translationMissing
And to top it all off, now we have basilisks wandering our town. The council have had enough!~|~translationMissing
What are you saying Agnar?~|~translationMissing
I have a declaration here signed by seven of our twelve council members. We declare this outerlander an exile!~|~translationMissing
This is outrageous! [Fremennik name] is one of us!~|~translationMissing
Do not use that name! The decision of the council is final. As Chieftain, you are honour bound to enact it.~|~translationMissing
Exile, you must leave our province. Our people will no longer see you as their brother.~|~translationMissing
Chieftain Brundt gestures his head towards the south east.~|~translationMissing
Leave at once. Do not attempt to interact with myself or my people.~|~translationMissing
Begone exile, you are a Fremennik no more.~|~translationMissing
Bjorn/Eldgrim~|~translationMissing
Gerr owtta 'ere befur ay mayke yew!~|~translationMissing

Yoo shuwdn't be warking 'round alown whyle exshiled!~|~translationMissing
Hi there! Who are you?~|~translationMissing
Falo the Bard~|~translationMissing
Hi there exile. I am Falo the bard! Like my brother Olaf, who lives in Rellekka, I also write music.~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to care too much about me getting exiled.~|~translationMissing
Well we're not in Rellekka down here so I don't think it matters too much.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. So, do you write about anything in particular?~|~translationMissing
Jarvald~|~translationMissing
Forgive me exile, though I can't allow you to board my ship.~|~translationMissing
Please Jarvald, it's really important!~|~translationMissing
Very well... for old times sake.~|~translationMissing
Do you wish to return to Rellekka?~|~translationMissing
Very well, but do make sure you're not spotted leaving my ship.~|~translationMissing
Maria Gunnars~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, [Fremennik name]. Do you have any questions?~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to be bothered about my exile.~|~translationMissing
I'm not. Neitiznot does not consider you an exile, that's just the mainland.~|~translationMissing
Mord Gunnars~|~translationMissing
Hail the conquering hero!~|~translationMissing
Heh. Thanks - I was pretty heroic even if I say so myself.~|~translationMissing
You do know I've been exiled right? You don't seem to care.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry [Fremennik name], your exile does not cover the island of Jatizso. We still consider you a Fremennik.~|~translationMissing
Your pet rock ignores you. You are an exile of the Fremennik Province.~|~translationMissing
Not you too!~|~translationMissing
Your pet rock continues to ignore you.~|~translationMissing
Aw...~|~translationMissing
Sailor~|~translationMissing
Don't talk to me exile.~|~translationMissing
Please, I must get to Miscellania.~|~translationMissing
You're lucky you're needed there. Just don't speak to me on the journey!~|~translationMissing
Hello. Can I get a ride on your ship?~|~translationMissing
Fine. I won't pretend to like it though.~|~translationMissing
Actually, no.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Suit yourself.~|~translationMissing
Thorodin~|~translationMissing
Exile. You don't have many friends around here at the moment.~|~translationMissing
How do you feel about it?~|~translationMissing
Doesn't bother me. Some people take these things more seriously than others. On that note, do you need something?~|~translationMissing
Sorry [Fremennik name], I can't be seen talking to you.~|~translationMissing
NPC~|~translationMissing
Leave exile, before I alert the guards.~|~translationMissing
Leave now, before I get rid of you myself.~|~translationMissing
Begone exile, you're no [brother/sister] to me.~|~translationMissing
Begone exile, before I call the Fremennik guards!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, you are our [brother/sister] no more. I cannot help you. Leave, before I must call the guards.~|~translationMissing
Well that was awkward...~|~translationMissing
Indeed. I'm sorry [Fremennik name]. The reality is that many on the council did not take kindly to you becoming one of us. They've been looking for a good excuse to exile you ever since you arrived.~|~translationMissing
But they're the ones that voted for me in the first place!~|~translationMissing
Well... not quite. Seven of the twelve council members gave you their vote, but you never had the support of the other five. They're the ones who've been pushing for your exile.~|~translationMissing
I see. And they've used this basilisk problem to convince some of the others.~|~translationMissing
It would seem so. Try not to judge them too harshly though, they only had what was best for the province in mind. This basilisk situation has a lot of people scared.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand though, they're only basilisks. Surely we have the strength to defeat them.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see you are not familiar with the End of Things.~|~translationMissing
The End of Things?~|~translationMissing
Many years ago, before the time of V, it was foretold that this world will end in a great battle. They called this battle Ragnarok, or more commonly, the End of Things.~|~translationMissing
Well that doesn't sound good. Where do the basilisks fit in?~|~translationMissing
The prophecies say that the battle will begin after the Serpent King is freed. So you see, it is not the basilisks people fear, it is what comes after.~|~translationMissing
Then we'd better make sure the Jormungand stays in that prison!~|~translationMissing
Well, [Fremennik name], that's why I asked you to meet me out here. If you are to help us put a stop to this threat, you'll need to regain the trust of the council. And I think I know just how you can do that.~|~translationMissing
I think the best possible way to show your worth to them is by being the person that restores V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
V's Shield?~|~translationMissing
The shield used by V when he defeated the Serpent King. It is legendary amongst our people. If we are to have any chance of stopping this threat, we will need to remake it.~|~translationMissing
There's a few things I know about the shield, though other things are lost from stories past.~|~translationMissing
I believe some members of the Moon Clan might know the details I don't, so your diplomatic relations should come in handy.~|~translationMissing
Keep in mind, now that you've been exiled, most people in the province will be unlikely to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. So where should I start?~|~translationMissing
Stories tell of how V's Shield was made using four components.~|~translationMissing
First, the base of the shield. This was a traditional Fremennik Shield, like the ones our warriors use.~|~translationMissing
Next, the Lunar Glass. This was apparently created by a great Moon Clan mystic and was used to reflect the Serpent King's gaze.~|~translationMissing
Then you have the Polishing Rock. This was needed to shine the Lunar Glass. This rock was heated softly in a boiling spring.~|~translationMissing
Finally, V's Sigil. This sigil was crafted by the Moon Clan, using a unique metal known only to them.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find a Fremennik Shield?~|~translationMissing
Fremennik Shields are only given to warriors of the province.~|~translationMissing
I made a round shield with arctic pine in my previous adventure to Neitiznot?~|~translationMissing
No, this shield is different. I'd recommend heading to Waterbirth Island. The daggermouths within the dungeon will likely have some from warriors they've sent to Valhalla.~|~translationMissing
You could slay them and reclaim a shield from their corpses.~|~translationMissing
What if that doesn't work?~|~translationMissing
There's a warrior down there known as Bardur, gathering many a daggermouth hide and saving Fremennik Shields.~|~translationMissing
If you have no luck finding a shield, perhaps you could charm him to give one to you?~|~translationMissing
Thanks Brundt, I'll keep that in mind.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any more questions about V's Shield, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
Where can I get Lunar Glass?~|~translationMissing
How do I make the Polishing Rock?~|~translationMissing
How do I make V's Sigil?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure I'm afraid. I imagine someone from the Moon Clan would likely have more knowledge on the matter.~|~translationMissing
I think I know just the chicken-legged-house-bound lady to ask!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about it...~|~translationMissing
Well firstly, a rock would probably help...~|~translationMissing
I know a guy! Well, a boy. Hopefully he'll still be willing to speak to me despite the exile.~|~translationMissing
Convenient. As for the matter of heating the rock, there's some hot springs on the mountain to the east that should be warm enough.~|~translationMissing
Use something to lower the rock into one of the geysers there, and you should be good to go.~|~translationMissing
V's Sigil is, well... in the shape of a V.~|~translationMissing
Oh... is that it?~|~translationMissing
Well, one side of the sigil is shaped like a basilisk. Spines down its back, and maw wide like a gate.~|~translationMissing
And the other side?~|~translationMissing
Nothing fancy. Just the other side of the letter V.~|~translationMissing
What exactly is it made of?~|~translationMissing
The stories tell of a cave on Lunar Isle where V first gained his power. Apparently it contains a unique metal used only by the Moon Clan.~|~translationMissing
I'd say three bars of this metal should be enough. Take them to an anvil and you should be able to make the sigil.~|~translationMissing
Once you have made the sigil, you'll need to have it enchanted. This was apparently done by a powerful spirit.~|~translationMissing
Do you know of such a spirit?~|~translationMissing
The stories didn't specify, though I would wager the Fossegrimen might be able to help.~|~translationMissing
Bardur~|~translationMissing
Ah! Exile! Begone with you, before you suffer the same fate as these fledglings!~|~translationMissing
Bardur, wait! I'm here with a task from the Chieftain.~|~translationMissing
I'm not too certain I should trust you! What is it you want?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking to remake V's Shield, but I require a Fremennik Shield from a warrior. Where could I find one?~|~translationMissing
The daggermouths found in these caves should drop a few when slain. They take them from fallen warriors. I have a few myself, in fact. I wish to give them back to the families of the fallen.~|~translationMissing
These fledgelings won't drop anything you're looking for, though. Search the caves for some matured daggermouths.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your time, Bardur.~|~translationMissing
You're lucky I'm busy exile! Things might have been different if I wasn't...~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could buy one off you?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Well I suppose the money would be of great help to the families of the fallen. Very well, I will sell you a shield for 150,000 coins.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a Fremennik shield for 150,000 coins.)~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I misjudged you, exile. Best of luck on your adventure.~|~translationMissing
That's far too much, I won't pay that!~|~translationMissing
Well I wouldn't expect an exile like you to care about the fallen. Be gone with you!~|~translationMissing
(If the player is wearing a ring of charos (a)~|~translationMissing
) (Charm) I could honour the fallen by remaking V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
I could honour the fallen by remaking V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... They would indeed be pleased. Having your shield used to make the shield of a hero would be an honour!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a Fremennik shield.)~|~translationMissing
Thanks Bardur.~|~translationMissing
Exile, has that shield served you well?~|~translationMissing
All the best, exile.~|~translationMissing
Ah! [player name], I'm glad to see you've returned. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you got anything to trade?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) It's a very interesting house you have here.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you could help me make Lunar Glass?~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you could help me make...~|~translationMissing
Lunar Glass?~|~translationMissing
You really need to stop doing that.~|~translationMissing
Stop doing what?~|~translationMissing
Stop finishing my...~|~translationMissing
Sentences? Sorry it's a force of habit! Mind reading and watnot[sic].~|~translationMissing
Oh don't look at me like that! I'm not the one who exiled you.~|~translationMissing
Look, those are my private thoughts! You can't just go reading my mind without permission.~|~translationMissing
Those aren't private thoughts! They're nothing compared to the other things I can see...~|~translationMissing
Please... can we just focus on the matter at hand?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have molten glass~|~translationMissing
Sure thing! Lunar Glass isn't so hard to make, but I will require a piece of Molten Glass. Return to me when you have some!~|~translationMissing
Thank y...~|~translationMissing
If the player has molten glass~|~translationMissing
Sure thing! Lunar Glass isn't so hard to make, but I will require...~|~translationMissing
Some Molten Glass? I have some right here!~|~translationMissing
Hey! That's... really annoying.~|~translationMissing
Oh, how the tables have turned!~|~translationMissing
How did you even know...~|~translationMissing
Anyway, let me imbue this piece of glass for you.~|~translationMissing
Baba Yaga imbues a piece of Molten Glass for you.~|~translationMissing
You will need to enchant it by using it on the Astral Altar. The process will also require 100 Astral Runes.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Can't you just do it for me?~|~translationMissing
Afraid not, I have lots of tidying to do around here.~|~translationMissing
Tidying?~|~translationMissing
Have you ever tried living in a house that's constantly shaking? It's a total nightmare, believe me.~|~translationMissing
I guess I never thought about that before, fair enough.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm good, thanks, bye.~|~translationMissing
Lunar Glass? I can do that. I will require a piece of Molten Glass. Return to me when you have some!~|~translationMissing
Yes! I have th...~|~translationMissing
The Molten Glass? Excellent!~|~translationMissing
That one wasn't even mind reading! I could have guessed what I was going to say there.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives molten glass (i).)~|~translationMissing
If the player has fewer than 100 astral runes~|~translationMissing
You need at least 100 Astral runes to attempt to enchant the glass.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 100 astral runes~|~translationMissing
You successfully enchant the glass and create some Lunar Glass.~|~translationMissing
Lunar Glass? You'll need some Imbued Glass first. Don't worry, I can make some more for you.~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to have any Molten Glass. Come back when you do!~|~translationMissing
There you go. Remember, you'll need to enchant it by using it on the Astral Altar. This process will also require 100 Astral Runes.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a pet rock~|~translationMissing
It might have helped if I'd actually remembered to bring my pet rock.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a pet rock~|~translationMissing
This geyser looks a little small. I'd probably do a better job heating this rock in a larger geyser!~|~translationMissing
Okay, here we go!~|~translationMissing
Your pet rock stares deeply into your eyes.~|~translationMissing
Any second now, I'm going to lower this rock into the geyser and boil it...~|~translationMissing
Your pet rock looks sad...~|~translationMissing
It's just a rock, how is it looking so sad? Come on, I can do this! For the Province!~|~translationMissing
Are you cruel enough to sacrifice your pet rock?~|~translationMissing
It's for the good of the Province!~|~translationMissing
It's for the good of the Province... I must do it!~|~translationMissing
Your pet rock gives you a stern look.~|~translationMissing
I can't do it! I love you pet rock.~|~translationMissing
You're right, pet rock... Why does it have to be this way?~|~translationMissing
You stroke your pet rock one last time, and reminisce about your previous adventures.~|~translationMissing
I can't do this to you with all of these happy memories!~|~translationMissing
Your pet rock gives you an empowering look.~|~translationMissing
You're right... I'll talk to Peer the Seer. He'll help me forget all of our times together.~|~translationMissing
It'll make this easier.~|~translationMissing
Peer the Seer~|~translationMissing
Though I appreciate your efforts in our trials, I'm afraid I can't speak to you [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Please, Seer! I'm on a mission for Brundt.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... If the Chieftain can still trust you, so can I. How may I be of assistance?~|~translationMissing
It's a bit of a sensitive subject...~|~translationMissing
You can tell me anything, [Fremennik name]. What's the matter?~|~translationMissing
I can't bring myself to boil my pet rock!~|~translationMissing
I know, I'm a horrible person! Please help me, I can't bring myself to do it.~|~translationMissing
Are you serious? I'm a busy man...~|~translationMissing
Please Seer, you're my only hope!~|~translationMissing
Very well. I'll clear your mind of any memories you have of your...~|~translationMissing
*cough*~|~translationMissing
pet rock...~|~translationMissing
I won't be able to speak with you after this. The others might start to get suspicious.~|~translationMissing
Concussio! Forgessan! Geodeus!~|~translationMissing
Thank you, Seer! I'll head back to the mountains now.~|~translationMissing
Now be gone with you, exile!~|~translationMissing
I know it's just an act... but that hurt.~|~translationMissing
You place the rock in the geyser.~|~translationMissing
Well I don't think that will be bobbing up to the top anytime soon! I'll need to fish it out with something.~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to be able to get my rock back with just my bare hands! I'll need to get something to fish it out.~|~translationMissing
I've already dropped one rock in there. I should try fishing it out rather than throwing more away.~|~translationMissing
You drop your rock into the geyser.~|~translationMissing
Darn it! That rock was hot...~|~translationMissing
If only I had something that could keep my hands cold!~|~translationMissing
Darn it! It would probably help if I actually wore my ice gloves.~|~translationMissing
The geyser has heated your rock, giving you a Polishing Rock.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a polishing rock.)~|~translationMissing
If the player has fewer than 3 lunar bars~|~translationMissing
You require 3 Lunar bars to make a V sigil.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 3 lunar bars~|~translationMissing
Would you like to make a V Sigil?~|~translationMissing
You hammer the three Lunar bars and make a V Sigil, exactly how Brundt described.~|~translationMissing
It will still need to be enchanted before it can be used for V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
Fossegrimen~|~translationMissing
What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I hear that I can present you with an offering and you will enchant my lyre for me.~|~translationMissing
This is true. For a simple enchantment, you may place an offering on my Altar. Can I help you with anything else?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Present offering of a single fish.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Ask about a permanent lyre enchantment.~|~translationMissing
Ask about V's Sigil.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the V sigil with them~|~translationMissing
I'm currently trying to remake V's Shield. I was told I need his sigil enchanted by a powerful spirit.~|~translationMissing
V? Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time...~|~translationMissing
You know of V?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. Were it not for V, this conversation might never had happened.~|~translationMissing
I owe V a debt that can never be repaid. It would be an honour to enchant his sigil.~|~translationMissing
Bring the unenchanted sigil to me and I'll provide you with what you need.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the V sigil with them~|~translationMissing
I've brought a sigil of V. Would you be able to enchant it for me?~|~translationMissing
*The Fossegrimen whispers an enchantment*~|~translationMissing
There you go! Go forth mighty warrior.~|~translationMissing
Greetings [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
I think I have everything needed to make V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
Well what are you waiting for? Get it made and we'll have everything we need to put an end to your exile.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a glassblowing pipe~|~translationMissing
You need a Glassblowing Pipe to make V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a glassblowing pipe~|~translationMissing
You meld the Lunar Glass to the Fremennik Shield. You then polish it with the Polishing Rock, which cools as you do so. Finally, you attach the V Sigil, finishing the shield.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives V's shield.)~|~translationMissing
I've completed V's Shield!~|~translationMissing
Hand it over then, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry. I simply left it in my bank. I'm such a ditzy person sometimes!~|~translationMissing
That's certainly one way to put it... Perhaps you should go and get it?~|~translationMissing
Will do, see you shortly!~|~translationMissing
You hand V's Shield to Brundt the Chieftain.~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name]... This is incredible! It's as if you forged the shield from a picture. It's exactly how I imagined it from the stories!~|~translationMissing
Do you think this will be enough to convince the council?~|~translationMissing
I hope so [Fremennik name]. I do suspect some of them may never respect you though.~|~translationMissing
Beggars can't be choosers, I suppose. Let's get going then...~|~translationMissing
The shield. It requires one last thing.~|~translationMissing
What's missing?~|~translationMissing
Return to me with two beers. No... Two kegs of beer! Quickly! There's not much time!~|~translationMissing
Okay!~|~translationMissing
Have you got the two kegs of beer?~|~translationMissing
I have them right here!~|~translationMissing
The chieftain takes both kegs and quickly drinks one.~|~translationMissing
I'm litchrally abousht to go shtand uhp to the enshtire *hiccup* counshil for yooo...! I need thish!~|~translationMissing
That's a very good point. Carry on then.~|~translationMissing
The chieftain quickly drinks the second keg and stumbles off.~|~translationMissing
I should probably head back to the longhall...~|~translationMissing
I actually have some here.~|~translationMissing
You're a bigger alcoholic than I am! Hand them over.~|~translationMissing
Good to see you [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
And you Brundt. You sobered up quickly.~|~translationMissing
We Fremennik know how to handle a drink, [Fremennik name]. Anyway, I have some good news for you.~|~translationMissing
Following your successful recreation of V's Shield, the council have agreed to end your exile. I hearby[sic] declare you a Fremennik again!~|~translationMissing
Not only that, but we would like you to be the one to carry V's legendary shield into battle.~|~translationMissing
So you should be [Fremennik name]. V was our greatest hero. There is no greater honour than to bear his shield in battle.~|~translationMissing
Brundt the Chieftain gives you V's Shield.~|~translationMissing
The basilisks intend to attack the town so they can keep us distracted while they free the Jormungand. Luckily for us, we know about this.~|~translationMissing
Once the attack begins, the majority of our forces will stay here to hold the town. While they do, you and I will journey to the Island of Stone.~|~translationMissing
There, we will ensure that the prison of the Jormungand remains sealed.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good, when do...~|~translationMissing
Fremennik Warrior~|~translationMissing
Basilisks in the market! Basilisks in the market!~|~translationMissing
Cutscene starts~|~translationMissing
They've walked right through our defences!~|~translationMissing
Kill them all!~|~translationMissing
You leave the battle.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the Jormungand.~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name]! Get to the boat. It's time for us to go!~|~translationMissing
This isn't good [Fremennik name]. The prison has already been breached.~|~translationMissing
So we're too late?~|~translationMissing
Not quite, but we'll have to act fast. If the Jormungand manages to leave the prison, the End of Things will be upon us.~|~translationMissing
Well we'd better get in there and make sure that doesn't happen.~|~translationMissing
It looks like the basilisks resealed the door behind them. We'll have to get through it.~|~translationMissing
From what I can tell, the door uses a combination lock. You'll need to get the right combination to unlock it. Too many wrong attempts will reset the lock though.~|~translationMissing
I'd better be careful then. I'll get to work.~|~translationMissing
Hurry [Fremennik name]. We can't afford to waste any time.~|~translationMissing
Have you opened the door yet?~|~translationMissing
Hurry [Fremennik name]. We need to get inside before it's too late.~|~translationMissing
That's the door unlocked.~|~translationMissing
Good work [Fremennik name]. Let's get inside and see what's going on.~|~translationMissing
Typhor~|~translationMissing
Humans!~|~translationMissing
Bakuna~|~translationMissing
Destroy them! Our king must be freed!~|~translationMissing
Vritra~|~translationMissing
It will be done.~|~translationMissing
With me [Fremennik name]! Let's kill these foul beasts!~|~translationMissing
Hurry [Fremennik name]! We need to get inside and stop those basilisks!~|~translationMissing
The Jormungand~|~translationMissing
At long last, I have been granted freedom. You have done well Bakuna.~|~translationMissing
I exist to serve.~|~translationMissing
Good, for I have one final use of you. My long rest has weakened me, you will grant me strength.~|~translationMissing
The Jormungand kills Bakuna in one hit~|~translationMissing
Power!~|~translationMissing
This isn't over yet [Fremennik name], the Jormungand is weak from his imprisonment! We can still stop him!~|~translationMissing
Humans, you have been bestowed with a great honour, for you are about to become the first of your kind in millennia to feed my power!~|~translationMissing
Rejoice with me, for your miserable lives are finally at an end!~|~translationMissing
You will not defeat us this day! Come [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
If The Jormungand uses his glare attack~|~translationMissing
Turn away [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
Don't look into his eyes!~|~translationMissing
Don't look at him [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name]! Do not face him!~|~translationMissing
If The Jormungand uses his binding attack~|~translationMissing
The stone is weak! You can break it!~|~translationMissing
Try to break free [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
[Fremennik name]! You need to break loose!~|~translationMissing
You can free yourself [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
Ah, nothing like a glorious fight to make you feel alive!~|~translationMissing
Now? We drink of course! The Jormungand has been defeated and the End of Things prevented!~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? They did manage to free him. How do you know we weren't too late?~|~translationMissing
You worry too much [Fremennik name]. If the end had begun, we'd have noticed by now. Come! Let us go and celebrate!~|~translationMissing
A cutscene starts with Olaf the Bard singing the Ballad of the Basilisk in the Rellekka longhall~|~translationMissing
Olaf the Bard~|~translationMissing
T'was on a haughty winter,~|~translationMissing
We're bitten with frost,~|~translationMissing
And none would dare venture,~|~translationMissing
Where many were lost.~|~translationMissing
V sailed his mighty longship,~|~translationMissing
After the first verse, the camera tilts down to reveal the adventurer standing amidst celebrating Fremenniks, leaving the bard to sing three more verses off-screen~|~translationMissing
Manni the Reveller~|~translationMissing
Another great victory for our people!~|~translationMissing
But it wouldn't have been possible without our brother, [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
You have truly proven yourself to be one of us, [Fremennik name]! I'm sorry we ever doubted you.~|~translationMissing
I'm just glad it all worked out in the end.~|~translationMissing
And on that note, time for a drink! I want to see if [Fremennik name] can still drink me under the table!~|~translationMissing
To the Island of Stone,~|~translationMissing
Where the king of the serpents,~|~translationMissing
Had made it his home.~|~translationMissing
The storm it was a ragin',~|~translationMissing
Waves broke on the deck,~|~translationMissing
The bell rang with a tolling,~|~translationMissing
To warn of the wreck.~|~translationMissing
But naught could deter him,~|~translationMissing
From the fate of his quest,~|~translationMissing
Winds tore through the main sail,~|~translationMissing
Yet onward he pressed.~|~translationMissing

That's a deal!~|~translationMissing
Excellent! I'm just waiting for my ship to arrive and then we can go.~|~translationMissing

Yes, I'm ready and don't mind it taking a few minutes.~|~translationMissing
Well, let's not waste any more time then!~|~translationMissing
A cutscene starts. The screen displays the Keldagrim Palace. In large, red letters, "Keldagrim, Grand Capital of the Dwarven realm" appear on screen. The text disappears, and the following text appears next~|~translationMissing
Five hundred years have passed since the rule of King Alvis,~|~translationMissing
saviour of Keldagrim, victim of his own inventions.~|~translationMissing
He founded the Consortium, the gathering of mining companies~|~translationMissing
that were to serve the monarchy. But eventually the monarchy came~|~translationMissing
to serve the Consortium.~|~translationMissing
By the time of his death, the monarchy was all but abolished.~|~translationMissing
Now the Kings in Keldagrim are but a distant memory,~|~translationMissing
with the only statue of King Alvis to remind people of the~|~translationMissing
old days. The dark days.~|~translationMissing
The camera pans throughout Keldagrim-West, and the text "Rise of the Red Axe Part 1" appears on screen. The camera then pans to the statue of King Alvis, and the text "The Giant Dwarf" appears. The scene then shifts to a map of the River Kelda, the statue, and a mini version of the dwarven boat, moving.~|~translationMissing
Look, there's the statue of King Alvis, guarding the entrance to Keldagrim!~|~translationMissing
Amazing! And we're going to go straight past it?~|~translationMissing
Er, hold on! There's something wrong!~|~translationMissing
Both Aaargh!~|~translationMissing
The boat crashes into the statue, destroying it. The cutscene then shifts to the dock in Keldagrim. Two Black Guard Berserkers are seen standing on the dock~|~translationMissing
Black Guard Berserker~|~translationMissing
Halt! By order of the Black Guard, you are under arrest!~|~translationMissing
What?? I didn't do anything! It wasn't me!~|~translationMissing
Come with us, human! Commander Veldaban wants a word with you!~|~translationMissing
The cutscene ends, and the player arrives at the Black Guard Headquarters.~|~translationMissing
Commander Veldaban~|~translationMissing
Identify yourself, human!~|~translationMissing
I err, I'm [player name]. I was told I was under arrest. I had a little accident on the way in here.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so you're the one who knocked over the statue of our glorious king!~|~translationMissing
I suppose so... I mean, I didn't do it on purpose or anything...~|~translationMissing
Ah, don't worry about it!~|~translationMissing
We haven't been ruled by a king for many a year... that statue was long overdue for replacement anyway. You're not under arrest, I merely wanted to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
But let me introduce myself. I am Veldaban, son of Dondakan. I am the Commander of the Black Guard in Keldagrim.~|~translationMissing
Well, ehm... nice to meet you, Veldaban.~|~translationMissing
Now listen carefully. I have a task for you.~|~translationMissing
I want you to go and see the local sculptor and help him build a new statue.~|~translationMissing
Will you do this for us?~|~translationMissing
No, I can't be bothered.~|~translationMissing
You destroy our statue and you cannot be bothered to help rebuild it? By Guthix, you are rude... even for a human!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I will do this.~|~translationMissing
You are a good human, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Now, I need you to go to Blasidar, he is a sculptor who lives in Keldagrim-East.~|~translationMissing
To be honest I'm not much of a sculptor myself.~|~translationMissing
Oh, don't worry! I just need you to help him out while he rebuilds the statue.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure there are many tasks that he needs doing.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have time right now, I'll be back later.~|~translationMissing
Sure, sure! Come back when you need to!~|~translationMissing
I prefer the mines to the city.~|~translationMissing
Well, suit yourself then!~|~translationMissing
Excuse me, are you Blasidar, the famous sculptor?~|~translationMissing
Blasidar the sculptor~|~translationMissing
Why, yes, yes, that I am!~|~translationMissing
Oh, well, I'm [player name]. Veldaban of the Black Guard sent me to you, you see. Said you might need some help with the statue.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I don't need an assistant sculptor, really, I can do just fine on my own.~|~translationMissing
I'm not a sculptor.~|~translationMissing
And I've also got a model here, you see, to base my statue on.~|~translationMissing
I'm not a model!~|~translationMissing
But come to think of it, I do need some errands run. Yes, quite important errands too.~|~translationMissing
Yes, you will do just fine.~|~translationMissing
Ehm, right, okay.~|~translationMissing
So what did you need doing?~|~translationMissing
Well, see... the Consortium has commisioned me to rebuild the statue exactly the way it was.~|~translationMissing
But the statue itself has broken into a million pieces... and we dwarves aren't very good painters, you know, so we don't have any paintings of it either.~|~translationMissing
Not a very artistic race, then, are you?~|~translationMissing
No, that's not what I said, I said we're not very good painters.~|~translationMissing
We're excellent with, for example, stone. Oh yes, quite good if I say so myself.~|~translationMissing
But I digress... simply speaking, I need some help with getting some items that I can base the new statue on.~|~translationMissing
Will you be able to help me with this, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
How rude is that? I don't think the Black Guard will be very pleased with you!~|~translationMissing
Excellent, excellent! Now what I need is the following...~|~translationMissing
I will need a pair of boots, the most exquisite boots you can find. The more they look like the original the better, but I don't think you'll be able to find an exact match.~|~translationMissing
For the torso, I need clothes that look like King Alvis' clothes. I'm not sure where you would be able to find that, but I'm sure you'll manage.~|~translationMissing
Also, I need a battleaxe. Now this is particularly important. You are in luck, however, as I believe King Alvis' original axe still survives.~|~translationMissing
Right, so I need a pair of boots, a piece of clothing and a battleaxe. Is that all?~|~translationMissing
For now, [player name], for now! I wish you good luck, and hurry back with the items!~|~translationMissing
But... wait, wait, how am I supposed to find all this?~|~translationMissing
I don't know! You're supposed to find that out for me!~|~translationMissing
But it's a beautiful city, Keldagrim is, I'm sure you'll see many things while you do these tasks!~|~translationMissing
Vermundi~|~translationMissing
Welcome to my clothes stall, can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes, what clothes do you have in stock?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm looking for some special clothes.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that sounds interesting, what's this about?~|~translationMissing
I'm helping the sculptor to rebuild the statue of King Alvis. But he wants to know what his clothes looked like.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, that statue is in a terrible mess, isn't it?~|~translationMissing
I could hear the tumult from over here!~|~translationMissing
But the clothes, do you have any similar clothes?~|~translationMissing
Oh no, no, I can't quite recall what the clothes looked like. But I know someone who can!~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm sure Hugi the librarian in West can help you along.~|~translationMissing
West?~|~translationMissing
Keldagrim-West, dear... on the other side of the Kelda, towards the north end of the city.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure he can show you the exact designs of the clothes.~|~translationMissing
But I need the actual clothes themselves, not just the designs.~|~translationMissing
Oh, just bring the designs to me then, I'll fix you up some nice clothes!~|~translationMissing
Sounds like a fun little thing to do!~|~translationMissing
Great, thanks a lot, I'll check out the library!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) No, I'm just browsing.~|~translationMissing
Librarian~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the Keldagrim library, human traveller!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you tell me more about the library?~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about King Alvis' clothes?~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about King Alvis's clothes?~|~translationMissing
His clothes? How do you mean?~|~translationMissing
I'm helping Blasidar the sculptor to rebuild the statue of King Alvis, but he needs to know the design of his clothes.~|~translationMissing
I see, I see.~|~translationMissing
There is a book, somewhere in the library, that may help you. It is the 'Scholars Guide to Dwarven Costumes' and it contains the designs of the costumes of a lot of old Kings and dwarven dignitaries.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like just the thing. Where exactly could I find it?~|~translationMissing
Let me think... I believe it is on the top shelf of one of the bookcases in the library, because it is such an old book.~|~translationMissing
Can you be any more specific? Upstairs, downstairs?~|~translationMissing
I don't remember, sorry. You will have to try several bookcases. You will probably need the ladders, tall a human though you are.~|~translationMissing
Well, thanks, I'll have a look.~|~translationMissing
If the player is over 30kg~|~translationMissing
As you put your foot on the bottom of the ladder, you hear it creak loudly... It nearly breaks! This ladder can't support your weight!~|~translationMissing
Bah. Annoying dwarven ladders, they're much too flimsy.~|~translationMissing
If the player is under 30kg~|~translationMissing
You dust off the book you just retrieved and read the title~|~translationMissing
'Scholars Guide to Dwarven Costumes'. Just what you need! You can take this to the clothes stall in the palace market now.~|~translationMissing
Yes, about those special clothes again...~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, did you get those designs from the librarian?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not spoken to Hugi~|~translationMissing
I haven't actually spoken to the librarian yet, let me do that now.~|~translationMissing
If the player has spoken to Hugi but did not retrieve the book~|~translationMissing
No, I don't have them yet, but I can get them for you. The librarian has a book.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the book on costumes~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have a book right here, have a look at it!~|~translationMissing
The player gives the book to Vermundi.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I see, I see!~|~translationMissing
I can definitely help you with this.~|~translationMissing
I only have one small problem, you see... I've run out of fuel for my spinning machine.~|~translationMissing
What does it run on?~|~translationMissing
Steam, of course!~|~translationMissing
But I've used up all my coal and wood and I don't have the time to leave my stall to get them.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'll get them for you. Let's see... some coal and some logs. Shouldn't be too hard.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not loaded the spinning machine~|~translationMissing
Well, like I said, I can't do anything really without my spinning machine.~|~translationMissing
Right, and what did you need again to start the engine?~|~translationMissing
Some coal and logs should do it!~|~translationMissing
If the player has both items~|~translationMissing
I've got them right here!~|~translationMissing
Then put them in the machine dear!~|~translationMissing
If the player has loaded the spinning machine but not started it~|~translationMissing
Well, the spinning machine is all ready now, except that it needs to be powered up.~|~translationMissing
As soon as it's up and running, I can spin your clothes for you.~|~translationMissing
How does that work?~|~translationMissing
Why, you light the logs of course!~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, I'll do it! Just a moment.~|~translationMissing
If the player has started the engine on the spinning machine~|~translationMissing
Can I have those clothes now?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I can spin them for you, but I will have to ask you for a small payment of money for them.~|~translationMissing
What, after all that work?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, but the cloth to spin this is expensive. But for you, I can make the clothes for a nominal fee of 200 credits.~|~translationMissing
I'll pay.~|~translationMissing
I'll pay, I'll pay.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful, let me get started then!~|~translationMissing
Vermundi spins the machine and makes the clothing.~|~translationMissing
There we go! And look how beautiful these clothes look!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives exquisite clothes.)~|~translationMissing
I won't pay.~|~translationMissing
I won't pay, that's outrageous!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry you feel that way, I was looking forward to making these clothes.~|~translationMissing
Saro~|~translationMissing
Welcome to my store, human! Are you interested in buying anything?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes, I'm looking for some armour.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm looking for a pair of special boots.~|~translationMissing
Boots, you say? What kind of boots?~|~translationMissing
The best you have! Boots fit for a king!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, let's see... Well, I've got this pair of very exclusive boots. They're not armoured, but they look nice.~|~translationMissing
Or rather, I had. I'm afraid I sold them, come to think of it.~|~translationMissing
And you don't have anything else?~|~translationMissing
I don't normally stock boots, no, nothing that's appropriate for... what did you say? A king?~|~translationMissing
Please, tell me! Who did you sell the boots to?~|~translationMissing
Old chap here in the west part of town, his name is Dromund. He's quite well known, not only for his wealth, but also for his... pecularities.~|~translationMissing
What house does he live in?~|~translationMissing
Go out the door, and head north. You'll have the headquarters of the Black Guard on your left and the bank on your right. Keep heading north and you'll find Dromund's house on your right. Can't miss it!~|~translationMissing
And if you're going to try to get the boots off him, good luck. You'll need it.~|~translationMissing
Dromund~|~translationMissing
You're trespassing, get out!~|~translationMissing
Calm down! I just want to ask you a few questions.~|~translationMissing
Are you with the Black Guard or something?~|~translationMissing
No, you wouldn't be, you're just a human.~|~translationMissing
What do you want from me?~|~translationMissing
I went to the Quality Armour shop. The proprietor told me you have just recently purchased a pair of boots from him.~|~translationMissing
Right, and nice they look too on my display tables.~|~translationMissing
You're not actually using them then? Might I be able to buy them off you?~|~translationMissing
Good one, human!~|~translationMissing
They're mine and the last thing I'll do is part with them!~|~translationMissing
Tell me, how much will you accept for these boots?~|~translationMissing
Get out you pesky human! The boots are mine and you're not having them!~|~translationMissing
If the player is in Dromund's line of sight~|~translationMissing
What are you doing there?!~|~translationMissing
If the player is outside Dromund's line of sight~|~translationMissing
(Player receives left boot.)~|~translationMissing
If the player is inside the house and is in Dromund's line of sight~|~translationMissing
What are you doing?!~|~translationMissing
Servants! We have another thief!~|~translationMissing
If the player is inside the house and is outside Dromund's line of sight~|~translationMissing
Cat~|~translationMissing
Stay away from there! Who do you think you are, coming into my house like that?~|~translationMissing
If the player is inside the house and casts Telekinetic Grab on the boots, outside Dromund's line of sight~|~translationMissing
What are you doing, casting spells in my house? Get out!~|~translationMissing
If the player is outside the house and casts Telekinetic Grab on the boots whilst it is in Dromund's line of sight~|~translationMissing
Hey! Is there someone at my window?~|~translationMissing
Scram before I get the Black Guard to arrest you!~|~translationMissing
If the player is outside the house and casts Telekinetic Grab on the boots, whilst it is outside Dromund's line of sight~|~translationMissing
(Player receives right boot.)~|~translationMissing
If the player only has one boot~|~translationMissing
What, wear just one boot? Besides, the boot is too precious for that.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the left and right boot~|~translationMissing
You now have the perfect pair of boots to bring to the sculptor's model!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives exquisite boots.)~|~translationMissing
If the player has the exquisite boots~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't wear these boots, I don't want anything to happen to them before I bring them to the sculptor.~|~translationMissing
Santiri~|~translationMissing
Welcome, human, to the Quality Weapons Shop! Can I interest you in a purchase?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Yes, I'm looking for some weapons.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm looking for a particular battleaxe.~|~translationMissing
Fancy a particular colour then? Blue is quite popular at the moment, and red is on the rise.~|~translationMissing
No, actually, I'm looking for King Alvis' axe.~|~translationMissing
The King's axe!~|~translationMissing
What would a human want with it?~|~translationMissing
I've been tasked by Veldaban, Commander of the Black Guard in Keldagrim, to assist in every way possible with the rebuilding of King Alvis' statue.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, the statue... a most unfortunate incident.~|~translationMissing
Not that I'm entirely sure that it was merely an accident, of course.~|~translationMissing
I'm not entirely sure what I mean, human. But the axe, you say, what exactly did you need it for?~|~translationMissing
Just give me the axe already, I know you have it!~|~translationMissing
I'll give it to you, embedded into your head!~|~translationMissing
I've had just about enough of this! Goodbye!~|~translationMissing
Blasidar the sculptor needs it for his statue.~|~translationMissing
Blasidar the sculptor needs it for his statue. He wants a model for the axe, you see, and he believes the original axe still survives.~|~translationMissing
And so it does!~|~translationMissing
It's been in my family's care for a few generations now, after it has been lost for a long time.~|~translationMissing
What happened to it?~|~translationMissing
I do not know how it got lost, but my great-grandfather found it at the banks of the Kelda, further downstream from the city.~|~translationMissing
Can I see it?~|~translationMissing
There is not much left of it, to be honest. The blade has almost completely rusted away, and the sapphires on the hilt were either stolen or were washed away by the river before it was found.~|~translationMissing
I doubt it is useful to Blasidar in this state, master sculptor though he is.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure this is the real axe then?~|~translationMissing
Not entirely, no, but it matches the description well enough, and the holes for the sapphires are still clearly visible on the hilt. But since no one has a similar claim, I don't really care. It's genuine to me.~|~translationMissing
This is tedious, I've lost interest.~|~translationMissing
I'll get back to work then.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I can repair the axe?~|~translationMissing
On your own? I doubt it. The sapphires, perhaps, if you are a skilled enough crafter. But the blade...~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Smithing level between 1 and 29~|~translationMissing
Your feeble smithing skills will be of no use. No, you will need expert help on this.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Smithing level between 30 and 74~|~translationMissing
You're a decent smith, but this is far beyond your capabilities.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Smithing level between 75 and 98~|~translationMissing
Formidable though your smithing skills are, this is beyond your capabilities.~|~translationMissing
If the player has level 99 Smithing~|~translationMissing
Clearly you are a master smith, perhaps one of the best human smiths in all of Gielinor. Yet this is beyond even you.~|~translationMissing
What you need is the skills of an Imcando dwarf... but they must all be dead by now.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed The Knight's Sword~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I could try and find one?~|~translationMissing
Yes, perhaps, perhaps...~|~translationMissing
Perhaps the librarian, just due east of here, can help you.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I like the sound of this!~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed The Knight's Sword~|~translationMissing
Oh, I know where I can find an Imcando dwarf!~|~translationMissing
He actually made a sword for me a while ago. I'm sure I can get him to help me again.~|~translationMissing
Really? That is amazing news.~|~translationMissing
He lives on a cliff at the very south end of Asgarnia, just south of Port Sarim. I can visit him again if you like.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! You can take a cart to Ice Mountain from the station here, that should help you get there faster.~|~translationMissing
I will entrust you with King Alvis' battleaxe, then, human.~|~translationMissing
Help to restore it to its former glory!~|~translationMissing
And please ask Blasidar to return it to me after he's done with it, I would sure love to see the restored blade again.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I will not disappoint you.~|~translationMissing
I don't really care for it after all.~|~translationMissing
Then stop wasting my time.~|~translationMissing
Can you help me find an Imcando dwarf?~|~translationMissing
An Imcando dwarf, you say?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I need the help of an Imcando dwarf to repair an ancient battleaxe.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I'm afraid I can't help you here, Keldagrim lost contact with that particular tribe of dwarves a long time ago.~|~translationMissing
Is there no one else who can help me?~|~translationMissing
I suppose you could try Reldo, in the palace of Varrock. He is a most capable human librarian and knows quite a bit about us dwarves.~|~translationMissing
Do you think he can help me?~|~translationMissing
He lives quite a good deal closer to where the Imcando used to live than we do, so it is not unlikely. Tell him Hugi the librarian sent you and I'm sure he'll be happy to help.~|~translationMissing
And take a cart to Ice Mountain from the station in the east side of the city. It'll help you get to Varrock faster.~|~translationMissing
Ask about Imcando dwarves.~|~translationMissing
I've come from Hugi, he suggested that I speak to you.~|~translationMissing
Hugi? I haven't seen him for a long time! He's still in Keldagrim, is he?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I should go there again some day, now that humans are allowed in again.~|~translationMissing
I've come to ask you about the Imcando dwarves. Hugi says you might know something about them.~|~translationMissing
The Imcando dwarves, you say?~|~translationMissing
Ah yes... for many hundreds of years they were the world's most skilled smiths. They used secret smithing knowledge passed down from generation to generation.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, about a century ago, the once thriving race was wiped out during the barbarian invasions of that time.~|~translationMissing
So are there any Imcando left at all?~|~translationMissing
I believe a few of them survived, but with the bulk of their population destroyed their numbers have dwindled even further.~|~translationMissing
They tend to keep to themselves, and they tend not to tell people they're descendants of the Imcando, which is why people think the tribe is extinct. However...~|~translationMissing
... you could try taking them some redberry pie. They REALLY like redberry pie. I believe I remember a couple living in Asgarnia near the cliffs on the Asgarnian southern peninsula.~|~translationMissing
Can you help me with this ancient axe?~|~translationMissing
Thurgo~|~translationMissing
No. I don't do that anymore. I'm getting old.~|~translationMissing
Would you like a redberry pie?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'll come back another time.~|~translationMissing
Well, you know what to do! Get me another redberry pie and I'll have a look at that axe of yours!~|~translationMissing
You see Thurgo's eyes light up.~|~translationMissing
I'd never say no to a redberry pie! We Imcando dwarves love them - they're GREAT!~|~translationMissing
You hand over the pie. Thurgo eats the pie. Thurgo pats his stomach.~|~translationMissing
By Guthix! THAT was good pie! Anyone who makes pie like THAT has got to be alright!~|~translationMissing
You make excellent redberry pies, [player name], so how can I refuse? Let me see what's wrong with it then.~|~translationMissing
Here... the blade of this axe has become extremely dull and brittle. I need it restored to its former glory.~|~translationMissing
Its former glory eh? May I ask where exactly you got this axe from?~|~translationMissing
It was given to me by someone in Keldagrim. I prefer not to say any more than that.~|~translationMissing
Ah, Keldagrim. We have not been there for a long time.~|~translationMissing
Hand me the axe and I'll fix it right up for you.~|~translationMissing
Will you need any materials?~|~translationMissing
You don't want any blurite this time?~|~translationMissing
Oh no, blurite is not appropriate here. No no, this is going to be a very delicate piece of work, requiring only a small amount in the way of raw materials.~|~translationMissing
Can you get me one bar of iron? Then I'll be able to start my work on this.~|~translationMissing
If the player has an iron bar~|~translationMissing
I've got one right here.~|~translationMissing
Good, good! Hand me the axe and I'll get to work.~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to black briefly.~|~translationMissing
Here you go, [player name], good as new.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help Thurgo!~|~translationMissing
You have restored the axe to its former glory! You should return to Blasidar in Keldagrim now, do you wish to return at once?~|~translationMissing
Return to Keldagrim immediately.~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to black briefly, and the player arrives at Keldagrim, where Blasidar is.~|~translationMissing
Explore the area before returning.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What is that cape you're wearing?~|~translationMissing
Here, I have these boots for you to wear.~|~translationMissing
Riki the sculptor's model~|~translationMissing
Thank... you.~|~translationMissing
And look, I have some clothes as well!~|~translationMissing
And finally, I have this battleaxe for you!~|~translationMissing
I've all the items you asked me to get you. Can you make the statue now?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, that will do just fine. There is only one problem now, I still need to make the head.~|~translationMissing
So you need me to find a crown now as well?~|~translationMissing
Oh no, no no, apparantly the Consortium has decided that crowns are out of fashion. As well as kings. Well, kings have been out of fashion here for hundreds of years.~|~translationMissing
So what is the head supposed to look like now?~|~translationMissing
I don't think they've quite made a decision on that. You see, I think each of the directors of the Consortium fancies their own face on top of the statue.~|~translationMissing
What? But I thought the whole point was that it would look like king what's-his-face?~|~translationMissing
Yes, the Consortium can be a little fickle like that, unfortunately.~|~translationMissing
But can you go and see if they've made a decision yet? I can't very well continue working on this statue without knowing what the face should look like, can I?~|~translationMissing
No, I suppose you can't. Alright, I'll check it out.~|~translationMissing
Great! In the mean time, I'll build the statue up to the neck!~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to black, and the partially completed statue is shown. The screen then fades and returns to the player.~|~translationMissing
[company name] Secretary~|~translationMissing
What can I do for you, human?~|~translationMissing
Can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
Was there anything you wanted?~|~translationMissing
What did you need of the [company name]?~|~translationMissing
Is there anything you need assistance with?~|~translationMissing
And what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Where am I?~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed zero or few tasks for the secretary~|~translationMissing
There's always work to be done, yes.~|~translationMissing
Just a moment.~|~translationMissing
Yes, the [company name] always has work to do!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think we do have something for you.~|~translationMissing
Let's see... yes, yes, I do have a task for you.~|~translationMissing
I believe we have some work available, yes.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed some tasks for the secretary~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, as you know the [company name] always has work!~|~translationMissing
Ah, always looking for ways to help us!~|~translationMissing
Of course, we reserve our best tasks just for you, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
The [company name] is pleased to offer more work to an eager worker such as yourself, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
I do believe we do, yes!~|~translationMissing
I dare say we have something for you, yes.~|~translationMissing
Naturally, my good human, naturally!~|~translationMissing
We need [number] pieces of [copper/tin/clay/iron/silver/coal/gold/mithril] ore in the next [number] minutes.~|~translationMissing
That ore needs to go on the trade floor soon, [player name], please hurry back with it.~|~translationMissing
I will await your return soon, then.~|~translationMissing
The clock is ticking, please hurry back.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, it's appreciated.~|~translationMissing
The [company name] has noted your willingness to help.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, I thought you'd like this!~|~translationMissing
You never disappoint, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
The [company name] appreciates the hard work you do.~|~translationMissing
Thanks! But hurry back please, we really need that ore!~|~translationMissing
I'm happy to hear that!~|~translationMissing
That's unfortunate to hear.~|~translationMissing
That does not reflect well on you.~|~translationMissing
Please, it would be appreciated if you made up your mind before you ask. I'm very busy you know.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, maybe some other time?~|~translationMissing
I can't say I'm too pleased to hear that, to be honest.~|~translationMissing
The [company name] isn't too pleased to hear that.~|~translationMissing
Please, in that case, you're wasting my time.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Didn't know you were the type to refuse work.~|~translationMissing
That's a great shame, [player name].~|~translationMissing
I suppose you have other important business to attend to?~|~translationMissing
Is everything okay? I didn't think you normally refused our tasks.~|~translationMissing
No? That's unusual for you, [player name].~|~translationMissing
I need to speak to the director.~|~translationMissing
And I would grant you such a request, why?~|~translationMissing
You need to prove yourself to the company first before such a privilege is bestowed on you.~|~translationMissing
But I've come from Blasidar the sculptor.~|~translationMissing
But you don't understand. I've come from Blasidar the sculptor.~|~translationMissing
Blasidar does not command the [company name].~|~translationMissing
But... Commander Veldaban of the Black Guard has instructed me to do this!~|~translationMissing
Nor does the Black Guard. They are under the command of the Consortium, not the other way around.~|~translationMissing
How can I prove myself?~|~translationMissing
It's all very simple. You perform some tasks for us, help us out a little when we need something done urgently, and in reward you will rise in our estimation.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I have to go!~|~translationMissing
I've completed your task! Here is your ore!~|~translationMissing
And not a minute too late as well. Well done.~|~translationMissing
I am happy to see that the trust we put in you has not been in vain.~|~translationMissing
The [company name] recognizes your performance.~|~translationMissing
That's good to hear, thanks.~|~translationMissing
I have to admit, I was worried for a moment, but I'm glad to see you came through for us.~|~translationMissing
Well done, well done!~|~translationMissing
You're always reliable, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
You have done a great service to the [company name]!~|~translationMissing
Wonderful! I will personally oversee that it goes to the trade floor on time!~|~translationMissing
I knew you were the right human for the job!~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I will make sure the director hears of your expeditiousness!~|~translationMissing
Do you have another task for me?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed enough tasks~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed enough tasks~|~translationMissing
You should speak directly to the director.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I have no more work to offer you, [player name], please speak to the director.~|~translationMissing
That is not a request that I can grant you yet, [player name], even though I am impressed with you so far.~|~translationMissing
The [company name] appreciates what you have done so far, [player name], but the director will only speak to the most loyal of followers.~|~translationMissing
Why, naturally [player name]! The director is standing right over there!~|~translationMissing
Red Axe Secretary~|~translationMissing
Don't bother me!~|~translationMissing
Brown Engine Secretary~|~translationMissing
I am the head secretary of the Brown Engine.~|~translationMissing
The what?~|~translationMissing
The Brown Engine. We are one of the eight major mining companies, but our standard is higher than that of all the others.~|~translationMissing
How is that?~|~translationMissing
Our policy is strictly gentlemen only, you see.~|~translationMissing
If the player's gender is male~|~translationMissing
I don't quite see how that is good, but if you say so...~|~translationMissing
If the player's gender is female~|~translationMissing
And this is a good thing, how?~|~translationMissing
Oh, my dear, please don't take it personally.~|~translationMissing
Don't patronise me. I've had enough of this.~|~translationMissing
The Brown Engine is a gentleman only society, I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
How rude.~|~translationMissing
Yellow Fortune Secretary~|~translationMissing
I am the head secretary of the Yellow Fortune.~|~translationMissing
The Yellow Fortune! We are the grandest of the mining companies that make up the Consortium!~|~translationMissing
Why, because men are not allowed to work in our company, of course!~|~translationMissing
Ha, I see what you mean!~|~translationMissing
That's a bit drastic, don't you think?~|~translationMissing
We simply consider men to be weak and inferior.~|~translationMissing
I think I'd better go now, I don't like being insulted.~|~translationMissing
The Yellow Fortune does not employ the services of men.~|~translationMissing
We often find that they are too weak or too slow to be of sufficient use.~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't say such things to people.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed zero or few tasks for the director~|~translationMissing
[company name] Director~|~translationMissing
You are an exceptional member of the [company name].~|~translationMissing
[player name]! I've been hearing great things about you!~|~translationMissing
Come in, [player name], my secretary has been saying good things about you.~|~translationMissing
What have you come to ask of us, honourable [player name]?~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed some tasks for the director~|~translationMissing
Have you come to serve the [company name] again, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Come, [player name], let us converse a while on your future with us.~|~translationMissing
You are proving yourself a loyal member of the [company name], [player name]!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) It's an honour to meet you!~|~translationMissing
I'd like to officially join your company.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, interesting, a human joining the [company name].~|~translationMissing
But no. You may have proven yourself to my head secretary, and much appreciated that is as well, you have not fully proven yourself to me yet.~|~translationMissing
So no, I cannot grant you this request yet, but I will certainly keep it in mind. In the mean time make sure you help out the [company name] in any way you can.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed enough tasks for the director~|~translationMissing
But you have certainly proven yourself to be a most worthwhile contributor. I have not seen such dedication in all my years as a director of this company.~|~translationMissing
It is agreed then! You are now a 'trusted associate' of the [company name]. Welcome!~|~translationMissing
I will not disappoint you!~|~translationMissing
Do you have any more tasks for me?~|~translationMissing
Verily, I believe I do.~|~translationMissing
I do believe so, yes.~|~translationMissing
Why, certainly.~|~translationMissing
A moment please, let me check.~|~translationMissing
We need [number] bars of [bronze/iron/steel/silver/gold/mithril] in the next [number] minutes.~|~translationMissing
Happy to hear that!~|~translationMissing
Admirable attitude, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
The [company name] appreciates what you're doing, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Excellent, get to it now!~|~translationMissing
Then hurry back, [player name], I'm counting on you!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to hear that, [player name], the company really needed those bars.~|~translationMissing
I don't understand, I thought you were a loyal follower?~|~translationMissing
Then why did you ask, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
That is an unusual thing to say for you, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Oh? I thought you liked doing this kind of work?~|~translationMissing
Blasidar the sculptor has sent me.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes? This is in connection with the statue, presumably?~|~translationMissing
He says he needs to know what the head of the statue should look like now that it's no longer going to look like King Alvis.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, Hreidmar suggested that it should be one of us. The Era of Kings is long gone, after all. Now the Consortium provides peace and above all prosperity... so the statue should reflect this.~|~translationMissing
Hreidmar? Who is Hreidmar?~|~translationMissing
He is the Director of the Red Axe. Ha, that old fool quite fancies his own head up on that statue, he thinks he can get away with that just because his company is one of the largest in the Consortium.~|~translationMissing
So I shouldn't tell the sculptor that he should base it on him then?~|~translationMissing
Certainly not!~|~translationMissing
The Consortium has yet to make a decision... all the companies are vying for the honour.~|~translationMissing
I would support you.~|~translationMissing
Ah, would you now, would you?~|~translationMissing
I'm not altogether sure... much appreciated though you are, you are not really part of the [company name]. Not as such.~|~translationMissing
What if I were?~|~translationMissing
Were what? A part of the [company name]?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that might certainly change things...~|~translationMissing
This might well work. Yes, an outsider to the city might have considerably more influence than one might expect, if we play our cards right.~|~translationMissing
How do you mean, play our cards right?~|~translationMissing
We wait until the most opportune moment for you to show your support. Yes, you must really come along to one of our meetings.~|~translationMissing
Now you're really losing me... what meetings?~|~translationMissing
A Consortium meeting, when all the directors meet on the top floor of the palace. We have them from time to time. We'll have another one soon, to once and for all solve our little problem with the statue.~|~translationMissing
So what do you say, will you speak out for me at the next meeting, so that they will base the head of the statue on me?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Long live the [company name]!~|~translationMissing
Hurrah!~|~translationMissing
Now would be a good time to visit Veldaban of the Black Guard, in the west of Keldagrim.~|~translationMissing
I need to have a think about that.~|~translationMissing
Understandable, yes. Just be sure not to think about it for too long.~|~translationMissing
I hope you lot figure it out soon.~|~translationMissing
I hope you lot figure it out soon. This little job is starting to tire me out.~|~translationMissing
Don't count on it being any time soon. We're rather locked in an impasse on it.~|~translationMissing
Just my luck.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Thank you for your time.~|~translationMissing
I've completed your task! Here are your bars!~|~translationMissing
I will get my secretary to send this to the trade floor at once!~|~translationMissing
You never fail to satisfy, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
You are a true asset to the [company name]!~|~translationMissing
I am well pleased with your work, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Guthix be praised!~|~translationMissing
The [company name] can always rely on you, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Have you ever considered joining the [company name], [player name]? You would truly make a marvelous member.~|~translationMissing
Red Axe Director~|~translationMissing
I am conducting a meeting here, begone!~|~translationMissing
If the player changed their gender from male to female~|~translationMissing
Brown Engine Director~|~translationMissing
Hello, [player name], are you trying to get in touch with your female side?~|~translationMissing
Hello there! You're looking a little feminine today, [player name]!~|~translationMissing
If the player changed their gender from female to male~|~translationMissing
Yellow Fortune Director~|~translationMissing
You are looking more and more like a male these days, [player name]... be careful now!~|~translationMissing
Hello there, [player name]. You look a little masculine today!~|~translationMissing
What news from the Consortium, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I have told the director of the [company name] that I will support their bid to be put upon the statue.~|~translationMissing
Then perhaps they can finally end their impasse! Well, let's go to the meeting then!~|~translationMissing
What, now?~|~translationMissing
If all sixteen cutscene rooms are occupied~|~translationMissing
Well... not exactly now, no. I believe the Consortium has some other important business to attend to first. Come back in a minute or so.~|~translationMissing
If a cutscene room is available~|~translationMissing
Yes, now! Are you ready?~|~translationMissing
I do have to warn you, this meeting may take a while. Do you want to attend the meeting personally, or do you simply want the minutes of the meetings so you can read what happened afterwards?~|~translationMissing
I want to see the meeting.~|~translationMissing
Happy to hear that! Let's hurry then, I think the meeting is already starting!~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm sorry, I was mistaken. The meeting hasn't started yet, we need to wait a bit longer.~|~translationMissing
The Consortium Meeting at Keldagrim Palace begins.~|~translationMissing
I do NOT want to attend, I don't have time to waste.~|~translationMissing
[player name], are you absolutely sure? You might not get another chance like this. Are you sure you just want to read the summary of the meeting instead of seeing the actual meeting?~|~translationMissing
On second thought, I can spare a few minutes to attend.~|~translationMissing
I just have a lot of smithing to do today, I can't attend.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I'll give you the meeting minutes after it's finished.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives meeting notes.)~|~translationMissing
No, I need more time.~|~translationMissing
Very well then. Come back when you're ready, but hurry! You don't want to miss the meeting.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene starts in the meeting room. The Red Axe Cat can be seen laying down. In large, red letters, "Keldagrim Palace, Consortium Meeting" appears on screen.~|~translationMissing
Clearly it is I who is most suitable.~|~translationMissing
You? How preposterous! Evidently, it should be my head atop that statue!~|~translationMissing
Silver Cog Director~|~translationMissing
Surely, your claim to the statue can be no better than anyone else's?~|~translationMissing
The camera pans away. The cat gets up, and walks away off screen. At the same time, the Red Axe Director walks into the meeting, and the scene shows all the directors in attendance.~|~translationMissing
Enough of this, everyone! This bickering is pointless.~|~translationMissing
The Red Axe is the largest and wealthiest mining company, we have all rights here!~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Between a Rock...~|~translationMissing
White Chisel Director~|~translationMissing
The fact that The Red Axe does its accounting behind closed doors makes that claim quite dubious!~|~translationMissing
Blue Opal Director~|~translationMissing
We are not assembled here to squabble over accounting details or the economic state of the Consortium.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Between a Rock...~|~translationMissing
Dondakan's breaking of his rock, and the finding of his gold, has laid doubt to that claim!~|~translationMissing
It is not yet clear what consequences that discovery will have on the economy.~|~translationMissing
Green Gemstone Director~|~translationMissing
Perhaps, then, we should choose a director for the statue at random?~|~translationMissing
No! I will go on top of that statue! I proposed this in the first place!~|~translationMissing
The scene changes to the meeting room entrance. Commander Veldaban and the player walk in.~|~translationMissing
Veldaban, Commander of the Black Guard in Keldagrim, presenting himself to the Consortium with a guest.~|~translationMissing
The player bows.~|~translationMissing
A human, at a Consortium meeting? What is this?~|~translationMissing
This human helped to rebuild the statue. [He/She] has deserved this honour, surely?~|~translationMissing
Purple Pewter Director~|~translationMissing
Well then... instead of flipping a coin, why don't we let the human decide?~|~translationMissing
Amusing, I accept!~|~translationMissing
This is outrageous! I'm warning you, The Red Axe will boycott the Trade Octagon!~|~translationMissing
Stop your hollow threats and let the human speak.~|~translationMissing
Well then, [player name], what is it going to be?~|~translationMissing
I choose...~|~translationMissing
The [chosen company name]!~|~translationMissing
The Red Axe Director walks towards the meeting room exit. His cat follows suit.~|~translationMissing
You'll regret this, all of you!~|~translationMissing
The cutscene shifts to the statue. In large, red letters, "A little while later" appears on screen. The camera pans to display the full statue, with the head being the director of the player's chosen company. The cutscene then ends.~|~translationMissing
A male? How preposterous!~|~translationMissing
But the statue is clearly male! It can't have a female head!~|~translationMissing

Broken clay golem~|~translationMissing
Damage... severe... Task... incomplete...~|~translationMissing
Start The Golem quest?~|~translationMissing
Shall I try to repair you?~|~translationMissing
Repairs... needed...~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to find a conversation here!~|~translationMissing
Graar!~|~translationMissing
Must... not... injure... human...~|~translationMissing
Damage... severe...~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should ask the golem first!~|~translationMissing
You apply some clay to the golem's wounds. The clay begins to harden in the hot sun.~|~translationMissing
You fix the golem's legs.~|~translationMissing
The golem is nearly whole.~|~translationMissing
You repair the golem with a final piece of clay.~|~translationMissing
Clay golem~|~translationMissing
Damage repaired...~|~translationMissing
Thank you. My body and mind are fully healed.~|~translationMissing
Now I must complete my task by defeating the great enemy.~|~translationMissing
What enemy?~|~translationMissing
A great demon. It broke through from its dimension to attack the city.~|~translationMissing
The golem army was created to fight it. Many were destroyed, but we drove the demon back!~|~translationMissing
The demon is still wounded. You must open the portal so that I can strike the final blow and complete my task.~|~translationMissing
My task is incomplete. You must open the portal so I can defeat the great demon.~|~translationMissing
How do I open the portal?~|~translationMissing
The four statuettes in the temple must be turned to the correct pattern.~|~translationMissing
I do not know the pattern. Golems are not permitted to open the portal.~|~translationMissing
What makes you think you can defeat the demon?~|~translationMissing
If not I, then who else?  No living being can destroy the demon. That is why the golems were created in the first place.~|~translationMissing
But the demon was badly wounded and elder-demons heal very slowly indeed. It was almost dead when it retreated to its own dimension.~|~translationMissing
Now that I am repaired, I will be able to destroy it easily!~|~translationMissing
What do you do here?~|~translationMissing
I'm helping with the dig. I'm an expert on Third Age architecture.~|~translationMissing
In the Third Age, this was a great city. Look at these giant walls! They put Varrock to shame!~|~translationMissing
I don't know, Varrock is pretty impressive.~|~translationMissing
I don't know, Varrock palace is impressive.~|~translationMissing
Hmph. I don't think it will look this good when it's been buried in the ground for three thousand years!~|~translationMissing
What happened to the city?~|~translationMissing
No one knows for sure.~|~translationMissing
But the Third Age was a time of destruction, when the gods were violently at war.~|~translationMissing
Many great civilizations were destroyed then.~|~translationMissing
I found a letter in the desert with your name on.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so you've found the ruins of Uzer.~|~translationMissing
AI wrote that letter to my late husband when he was exploring there.~|~translationMissing
that was a great city as well, but the museum could only fund one excavation and this one was closer to home.~|~translationMissing
If you're interested in his expedition, the notes he made are in the library in the Exam Centre.~|~translationMissing
Where did you say the notes were?~|~translationMissing
They're on a bookcase in the Exam Centre.~|~translationMissing
You search the bookcase~|~translationMissing
You find Varmen's expedition notes.~|~translationMissing
Where is the statuette that Varmen took back from Uzer?~|~translationMissing
The statuette?  Oh, yes...~|~translationMissing
That statuette was the only thing we had to show from that expedition.~|~translationMissing
It was very worn, but you can still make out a lot of detail. The Uzerians were expert sculptors. It's a pity we only have that small example.~|~translationMissing
Now it's on display in the Varrock museum.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Fossil Island~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you any interesting news?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a statuette recovered from the city of Uzer.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, a very impressive artefact. The people of that city were excellent sculptors.~|~translationMissing
It's in the display case upstairs.~|~translationMissing
No, I need to take it away with me.~|~translationMissing
What do you want it for?~|~translationMissing
I want to open a portal to the lair of an elder-demon.~|~translationMissing
Good heavens! I'd never let you do such a dangerous thing.~|~translationMissing
Well, I, er, just want it.~|~translationMissing
Well, you can't have it! This museum never lets go of its treasures.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet learned about the display case~|~translationMissing
The curator doesn't seem to have anything of value.~|~translationMissing
You steal a tiny key.~|~translationMissing
The cabinet is locked.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the statuette~|~translationMissing
You have already taken the statuette.~|~translationMissing
You open the cabinet and retrieve the statuette.~|~translationMissing
That statuette was stolen recently, but now it's been returned.~|~translationMissing
You insert the key and the golem's skull hinges open.~|~translationMissing
The golems skull shuts automatically.~|~translationMissing
If there is already a statuette in the alcove~|~translationMissing
There is already a statuette in the alcove.~|~translationMissing
You insert the statuette into the alcove.~|~translationMissing
The door grinds open.~|~translationMissing
The statuette is now locked in place.~|~translationMissing
I opened the portal.~|~translationMissing
Golems cannot pass through the portal. But the demon will soon emerge. I must ready myself for combat!~|~translationMissing
You step into the portal.~|~translationMissing
If this is the first time the player has entered the portal~|~translationMissing
This room is dominated by a colossal horned skeleton!~|~translationMissing
If the player has no chisel~|~translationMissing
You'll need a chisel as well as a hammer to get the gems.~|~translationMissing
It's okay, the demon is dead!~|~translationMissing
The demon must be defeated...~|~translationMissing
No, you don't understand. I saw the demon's skeleton. It must have died of its wounds.~|~translationMissing
Demon must be defeated! Task incomplete.~|~translationMissing
I already told you, he's dead!~|~translationMissing
Task incomplete.~|~translationMissing
Oh, how am I going to convince you?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a phoenix feather or quill pen~|~translationMissing
You already have a phoenix tail-feather.~|~translationMissing
You attempt to grab the phoenix's tail-feather.~|~translationMissing
You grab a tail-feather.~|~translationMissing
You fail to grab the feather.~|~translationMissing
Desert Phoenix~|~translationMissing
Squawk!~|~translationMissing
You pick a mushroom.~|~translationMissing
You crush the mushroom and pour the juice into a vial.~|~translationMissing
You crush the mushroom, but you have no vial to put the dye in and it goes everywhere!~|~translationMissing
You will need some kind of ink to write with.~|~translationMissing
You dip the phoenix feather into the dye.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not learned that the demon is dead~|~translationMissing
You don't know what to write.~|~translationMissing
You write on the papyrus~|~translationMissing
YOUR TASK IS DONE~|~translationMissing
You can't see a way to put the instructions in the golem's skull~|~translationMissing
New instructions... Updating program...~|~translationMissing
Task complete!~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Now my mind is at rest.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for helping me. A golem can have no greater satisfaction than knowing that its task is complete.~|~translationMissing
But the whole city is destroyed! Doesn't that bother you?~|~translationMissing
I was never programmed to appreciate the city. My only purpose was the destruction of the demon, and that is achieved!~|~translationMissing

Eeee, wha' shall I do! I'll mos' certainly lose tha job...~|~translationMissing
Lose your job? What's wrong, why?~|~translationMissing
I w-w-work... over yon sand pit... and weeell... I found... this... hand! T'were buried in't Sand!~|~translationMissing
Oh, you found a hand in the sand - that's nice for you.~|~translationMissing
Eww a hand, in the sand! Why haven't you told the authorities?~|~translationMissing
They's no' wha' they once was. Tha cap'ain o'the Guard spends near all o'the time drunk in yon pub.~|~translationMissing
Oh? The Guard Captain is drunk in the pub you say? That's not good, what will you do?~|~translationMissing
Weeellll... do yer think yer could 'elp me?~|~translationMissing
Start The Hand in the Sand quest?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I'll give you a hand.~|~translationMissing
..... Nae, ye can 'ave the 'and as h'evidence.~|~translationMissing
Bert gives you a rather smelly, sand covered hand.~|~translationMissing
P'raps tha smell will get t'Guard Cap'ain's nose out o'his beer fer 2 seconds!~|~translationMissing
I want no part in this!~|~translationMissing
Did ye see yon Guard Capt'n 'bout hand?~|~translationMissing
Not at the moment, but I will be seeing him soon.~|~translationMissing
Guard Captain~|~translationMissing
Need more beer...~|~translationMissing
Sir? I have some more beer for you...~|~translationMissing
You give the beer to the Guard Captain who takes a large gulp.~|~translationMissing
Ahh... jus' wha' I need, now, wha' did you wanna know?~|~translationMissing
I've come to report that Bert, the sandman, found a hand in the sand pit.~|~translationMissing
Lucky for him, means he can get even more work done.~|~translationMissing
But aren't you going to find out who it ... belonged to?~|~translationMissing
You hand the... hand... to the Guard Captain, he fumbles with it, drops it in his beer, fishes it out and hands it back.~|~translationMissing
Oops, No 'arm done. S'prob'ly a wizard, i's always the wizards fault, go ask them, jus' ring the bell outshide the guild and talk to the first pointy hatted ninny you shee!~|~translationMissing
Err... ok, I'll go ring the bell and talk to a wizard then.~|~translationMissing
Yes, the Guard Captain said to see the wizards in the guild.~|~translationMissing
So why you hangin' abou' 'ere then? Go ring t'bell at t'mage guild just over yonder!~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the sandy hand~|~translationMissing
It seems to have slipped through my fingers!~|~translationMissing
Tha's no' surprisin' with yer bag so full, come back when s'not.~|~translationMissing
Thank t'gods! I tho' I was bein invaded by undead 'ands from t'sand when I found this'un! Take i' to tha mage guild and ring tha' bell to talk ta someone.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Bert, I'm off to see the wizards, the wonderful wizards of Yanille!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Beer soaked hand.)~|~translationMissing
Not at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Hello Sir!~|~translationMissing
Go 'way! This pint'sh nearly finished! Unlessh you got more that ish....? Wizards, s'all the wizard's fault...prob'ly that Zavistic one, he'sh the worsht!~|~translationMissing
E're, you left this 'and in me beer!~|~translationMissing
No good if you don' have space fer it in yer invent'ry, come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
The Guard Captain fished the hand out of his beer and hands it to you.~|~translationMissing
Speaking to Zavistic Rarve via the bell~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Zogre Flesh Eaters~|~translationMissing
Zavistic Rarve~|~translationMissing
What are you doing...Oh, it's you...sorry...didn't realise...what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm here about the sicks...err Zogres~|~translationMissing
I have a rather sandy problem that I'd like to palm off on you.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing ringing that bell?! Don't you think some of us have work to do?~|~translationMissing
But I was told to ring the bell if I wanted some attention.~|~translationMissing
Well...anyway...we're very busy here, hurry up what do you want?~|~translationMissing
Speaking to Zavistic Rarve inside the guild~|~translationMissing
What are you doing bothering me? Don't you think some of us have work to do?~|~translationMissing
I thought you were here to help?~|~translationMissing
Well... I am, I suppose, anyway... we're very busy here, hurry up, what do you want?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the beer soaked hand in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Maybe you should have the hand with you before speaking to Zavistic.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the beer soaked hand in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You wave the hand at the wizard.~|~translationMissing
Ummm... Do you have all your wizards?~|~translationMissing
All my.... whatever do you mean...?~|~translationMissing
The Guard Captain asked me to see if you have any... missing... wizards.~|~translationMissing
That's silly! No one would kill a wizard... would they?~|~translationMissing
Erm... no...~|~translationMissing
Well.. maybe, you see Bert found this hand and it might belong to.. a wizard!~|~translationMissing
Bert? Ahh yes, the sandman who seems to have been working very long hours recently. Let's see that hand...~|~translationMissing
You hand it over.~|~translationMissing
Oh my! This is most definitely Clarence, my most able student! You must find out who did this!~|~translationMissing
Do you have any input as to the matter at hand?~|~translationMissing
Well.... Ask Bert about the long hours he's been working, that sounds suspicious to me. Digging things up at all hours of the day isn't natural.~|~translationMissing
Did you find out who killed Clarence yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but don't lose your head over it.~|~translationMissing
I don' need a hand drinkin me beer, go 'way!~|~translationMissing
Talk to tha' hand coz thish face ain't lishtnin'!~|~translationMissing
Wha' info ye find 'bout hand, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I dug up quite a lot about the hand. Can you tell me about your job?~|~translationMissing
Sand! Lots o' sand! Me boss be Sandy o' Sandy's Sand Corp based in Brimhaven on tha isle of Karamja an' I hauls sand fr' there to yon sand pit.~|~translationMissing
I's looong harrrrd hours, bu' keeps me busy, y'know what tha say! 'Idle hands'r Zamorak's tools.'~|~translationMissing
So you're employed by Sandy's Sand Corp in Brimhaven. Have you changed your hours recently?~|~translationMissing
Yer coul' see fer yerself iffen yer had space in yorn invent'ry, come back when yer do.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Bert's rota.)~|~translationMissing
Nae! See fer yersel', here's a copy o' me rota tha' be held a' head office - yer can looksee iffin ye talk t' Sandy, me boss.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the Rota Bert. I'll go check for the original with Sandy in Brimhaven.~|~translationMissing
Ey'up [player name]. Did yer see Sandy in Brimhaven 'bout me rota?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the rota~|~translationMissing
Err, no, I kind of... lost it...~|~translationMissing
Lucky fer yorn tha' I's made a copy then ain't it, I's 'ave been given it to yer iffen you 'ad some space in yer invent'ry.~|~translationMissing
Is you stupid? I said I'd give ye another but yer bags be full!~|~translationMissing
Lucky fer yorn tha' I's made a copy then ain't it, 'ere 'ave another.~|~translationMissing
No, I'll fit it in my schedule somewhere soon.~|~translationMissing
Hello Sir, do you run the Sand Corp?~|~translationMissing
Sandy~|~translationMissing
Who wants to know?~|~translationMissing
I'm [player name]. I'm here investigating the possible murder of a wizard.~|~translationMissing
I don't care about that, I have far too much work to do. Let the authorities take care of things like murder and stop snooping around my office!~|~translationMissing
Sand seems very keen to get you out of the office, perhaps you should take a look around.~|~translationMissing
I'd better make room in my inventory first!~|~translationMissing
If the pickpocket attempt fails~|~translationMissing
You felt something but it slipped through your fingers...~|~translationMissing
If the pickpocket attempt succeeds~|~translationMissing
You rummage around in Sandy's pockets...~|~translationMissing
You find a small amount of sand.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have Sandy's rota~|~translationMissing
You quickly sift through some of the papers on Sandy's desk and find a work rota for Bert.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has Sandy's rota~|~translationMissing
You already have Sandy's original work rota.~|~translationMissing
You already have the rota, perhaps you should take both rotas back to Bert in Yanille.~|~translationMissing
I managed to get a copy of the original rota. Your hours changed a week ago!~|~translationMissing
Nae! Nae! I din't remember tha', bu'... hmmm, aye... tha' migh' be it...~|~translationMissing
What? Give me a hand here, I'm having a hard time understanding how you don't remember changing hours!~|~translationMissing
I's all be tha wizard's fault! Tha magic leaks fr'm yon magic guild I tells yer! Tha's why this weirrrrd scroll appeareded a week ago!~|~translationMissing
A scroll appeared? Can I take a look at it while you look at the rotas?~|~translationMissing
O'course [player name], le's be 'avin'yon rota and 'ere be tha scroll, yer be takin' it back ta those inferrrnal wizards quick sharp!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives A magic scroll.)~|~translationMissing
I be hopin' tha search is goin' well... are tha wizard's owning up ta anythin' yet?~|~translationMissing
I've found out a lot and will let you know when it's all over.~|~translationMissing
I talked to Bert and found something very strange about his hours.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Did he kill Clarence?~|~translationMissing
No, but he doesn't remember changing his hours, and his rota and the original that his boss Sandy had, are different!~|~translationMissing
... oh, and this scroll appeared when they changed - he gave it to me.~|~translationMissing
I recognise that type of scroll! It's used in a mind altering spell of some sort. Did you speak to this... Sandy guy? Perhaps he has a hand in this.~|~translationMissing
I took a look around his office. I don't know about a hand in it, I think he has both hands and feet in it!~|~translationMissing
Even more suspicious! Here, take this magical scrying orb and get some Truth Serum from Betty in Port Sarim, she owes me a favour, just tell her I sent you if she complains.~|~translationMissing
Then you will be equipped to ask Sandy a few questions. Oh Clarence, I will find your murderer!~|~translationMissing
You exchange the scroll for the magical scrying orb. Perhaps Zavistic can give you even more of a hand to find the murderer?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the magical orb~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What is there to do in the Wizards' Guild?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What are the requirements to get in the Wizards' Guild?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do you do in the Guild?~|~translationMissing
I've lost my magical scrying orb!~|~translationMissing
I'd give you another magical scrying orb if you had some space in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
No matter, here, have another and please hurry, whoever killed Clarence must pay!~|~translationMissing
Can you help me more?~|~translationMissing
Bring me a vial and I'll help you a little more.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a vial with them~|~translationMissing
If the player has a vial with them~|~translationMissing
I have a vial here for you.~|~translationMissing
Ok, would you like me to transport you to Port Sarim? I'm sticking my neck out a bit helping you like this and can only do it once though!~|~translationMissing
Yes, that would be great!~|~translationMissing
Off you go then, break a leg!~|~translationMissing
The player is teleported to Betty shop.~|~translationMissing
No, I prefer using my legs, thanks all the same.~|~translationMissing
Ok, suit yourself!~|~translationMissing
Talk to Betty about the Hand in the Sand.~|~translationMissing
I've come from Yanille, the wizard says you can make Truth Serum?~|~translationMissing
Betty~|~translationMissing
This is true deary, I'll need an empty vial.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have an empty vial~|~translationMissing
I'll have to go find one then, I'll be back!~|~translationMissing
I have one here!~|~translationMissing
That's good, now you'll need to make a rose tinted lens. Pink dye can be made from red berries in this bottle to make redberry juice, then add white berries. Just use that on a bullseye lens.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Talk to Betty about her shop.~|~translationMissing
Using the redberries on the bottled water~|~translationMissing
Now you just need to add the white berries to make the pink dye.~|~translationMissing
Using the pink dye on the lantern lens~|~translationMissing
You have successfully made the rose tinted lens!~|~translationMissing
Hello deary! Have you managed to make that lens yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I've forgotten how!~|~translationMissing
Pink dye can be made from red berries in the bottle I gave you. Add white berries to make the pink dye and then you just need to use that on a bullseye lens. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
Wonderful deary. When you're ready, just stand in the open doorway and focus the light on the empty vial on my desk and I'll pour the serum into it.~|~translationMissing
Ok, what does that do?~|~translationMissing
Why it makes the person who drinks it unable to hide in the shadow of lies. The light of truth will shine!~|~translationMissing
Betty places a vial on her counter.~|~translationMissing
As you focus the light on the vial and betty pours the potion in, the lens heats up and shatters. After a few seconds betty hand you the vial of Truth Serum.~|~translationMissing
Ok, now the last ingredient, something personal from the person you need to tell the truth, else it won't work!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the sand~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll see if I can find something.~|~translationMissing
What about this sand straight from his pocket?~|~translationMissing
That's excellent deary!~|~translationMissing
You hand the sand and watch Betty sprinkle it in the serum, it fizzes.~|~translationMissing
Don't forget to dilute it in something like tea or coffee.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you should let Betty do that, it looks tricky.~|~translationMissing
Hello deary! How did the serum work?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the truth serum~|~translationMissing
I've forgotten how to use the serum.~|~translationMissing
I've lost it!~|~translationMissing
I've lost it!}}~|~translationMissing
That's not a problem, I kept some of it here just in case, but you have no space for it! Come back when you do[sic]~|~translationMissing
That's not a problem, I kept some of it here just in case, here you are!~|~translationMissing
Betty hands you a new vial of truth serum.~|~translationMissing
I haven't tried it yet.~|~translationMissing
Well don't forget to dilute it in a drink or something else bad things might happen.~|~translationMissing
Bad things?~|~translationMissing
Well.... bits might drop off.~|~translationMissing
Oh! I... see. I'll remember to dilute it then.~|~translationMissing
Have you made the serum and talked to Sandy yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, but don't bust a gut over it!~|~translationMissing
If the the truth serum isn't complete~|~translationMissing
You'll need to have completed the truth serum before doing that!~|~translationMissing
If Sandy has not been distracted~|~translationMissing
You'll need to distract Sandy before doing that.~|~translationMissing
If sandy has been distracted~|~translationMissing
You pour the serum in Sandy's coffee, the a little while later watch him drink it.~|~translationMissing
I don't have time to talk to you. Go away!~|~translationMissing
There's a herd of huge mutant herring about to drop from the sky!~|~translationMissing
If distracting Sandy succeeds~|~translationMissing
Wow! I must see this!~|~translationMissing
If distracting Sandy fails~|~translationMissing
I'm not falling for that one!~|~translationMissing
But the pygmy shrews have eaten all the sand!~|~translationMissing
A small parrot with a pink banana is sitting outside your window!~|~translationMissing
You rub the magical scrying orb as the Wizard[sic] told you, it starts to glow, recording everything it sees and hears, now you can talk to Sandy in Brimhaven.~|~translationMissing
If the magical orb is not activated~|~translationMissing
You need to activate the magical scrying orb, obtained from the wizard in Yanille, to capture the conversation with Sandy!~|~translationMissing
If the magical orb is activated~|~translationMissing
Now, I'm going to ask you some questions and I want you to answer me truthfully...~|~translationMissing
Why is Bert's rota different from the original?~|~translationMissing
Because... I changed it.~|~translationMissing
If all questions have been asked~|~translationMissing
If not all questions have been asked~|~translationMissing
Why doesn't Bert remember the change in his hours?~|~translationMissing
Because.... because.... I bribed a wizard to put a spell on him so he would believe everything I say!!~|~translationMissing
So that I could make him work longer without paying him more!~|~translationMissing
What happened to the wizard?~|~translationMissing
I...I... I KILLED HIM! So I wouldn't have to pay him and no one would know. I put his body in the next load of sand.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'm done with you.~|~translationMissing
If all the available questions have not been asked~|~translationMissing
You need to ask Sandy all the questions.~|~translationMissing
I think I have enough evidence now, you can go for now, but I think you're up to your neck in it!~|~translationMissing
Sandy has told you all he knows. The magical orb is full and needs to be returned to the Wizard[sic] in Yanille.~|~translationMissing
Hello again deary. Come back and tell me what happened when all the fuss is over.~|~translationMissing
Ok Betty, I'll be back!~|~translationMissing
If the orb is lost or isn't in the player's inventory~|~translationMissing
I got the whole story from Sandy... but I lost the orb.~|~translationMissing
It's ok, I saw the whole thing as the orb is connected via magic to me as I enchanted it.~|~translationMissing
I think this Sandy needs a lesson, please bring me 5 earth runes and a bucket of sand.~|~translationMissing
Else, with the orb in hand~|~translationMissing
You hand the magical scrying orb to the Wizard[sic] and watch as the recording is played back.~|~translationMissing
Well, well...I think this Sandy needs a lesson, please bring me 5 earth runes and a bucket of sand.~|~translationMissing
Erm, why?~|~translationMissing
Don't question me or you'll end up as braindead as that legless Guard Captain!~|~translationMissing
Umm.. ok, I'll get you the 5 earth runes and bucket of sand.~|~translationMissing
You really mean you forgot? Bring me 5 earth runes and 1 bucket of sand to help stop that moneygrabbing Sandy!~|~translationMissing
I've brought what you wanted, what are you going to do?~|~translationMissing
Ahh excellent, let's have those! Watch and learn...~|~translationMissing
The Wizard chants and your attention to the sandpit where Bert is found.~|~translationMissing
My sand! My lovely sand!~|~translationMissing
Something very strange happens to the Sandpit, it looks like it has filled itself up!~|~translationMissing
There, the sand pit will now magically refill. No more work for Bert!~|~translationMissing
We must find the rest of Clarence, I've sent some wizards out to some of the sandpits, would you please check the Entrana sandpit?~|~translationMissing
Mazion~|~translationMissing
Uh...greetings [player name]!~|~translationMissing
Uhh... How do you know my name?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I like to keep ahead of things.~|~translationMissing
Err.. ok. Well, I've been sent from the Wizards' Guild in Yanille. There's been an... incident... Do you have any body parts?~|~translationMissing
How did you know! I found the most awful thing in my sandpit - a head!~|~translationMissing
Ahhh good! I need to take it back to be buried!~|~translationMissing
You're very strange, but if it means I get rid of the horrid thing...~|~translationMissing
Or I would if you had any room in your bag!~|~translationMissing
Mazion gives you the head.~|~translationMissing
I see you still have that head! Take it back to the Wizards in Yanille!~|~translationMissing
Hello again [player name]!~|~translationMissing
What should I do with the head?~|~translationMissing
It was you that came demanding the head to give to the wizard in the first place! Go back to Yanille with it!~|~translationMissing
I've lost my head!~|~translationMissing
You dropped it and you don't have room to carry it now, come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
Keep your hair on! You dropped it! Make sure you take it straight back to the wizards else you won't have a leg to stand on.~|~translationMissing
Did you visit the Entrana sandpit yet? Ask the worker there if he's found an arm or a leg.~|~translationMissing
Not yet no. I've been running around like a headless chicken, but I'll get to it!~|~translationMissing
You show the wizard the head.~|~translationMissing
Alas poor Clarence. I knew him, [player name].~|~translationMissing
Thank you - we shall bury him today. I have sent word for the guards to arrest Sandy, so no one will ever see him again!~|~translationMissing

Squire~|~translationMissing
Hello. I am the squire to Sir Vyvin.~|~translationMissing
And how is life as a squire?~|~translationMissing
Well, Sir Vyvin is a good guy to work for, however, I'm in a spot of trouble today. I've gone and lost Sir Vyvin's sword!~|~translationMissing
Do you know where you lost it?~|~translationMissing
Well now, if I knew THAT it wouldn't be lost, now would it?~|~translationMissing
Well, do you know the VAGUE AREA you lost it?~|~translationMissing
Well, do you know the VAGUE AREA you lost it in?~|~translationMissing
No. I was carrying it for him all the way from where he had it stored in Lumbridge. It must have slipped from my pack during the trip, and you know what people are like these days...~|~translationMissing
Someone will have just picked it up and kept it for themselves.~|~translationMissing
I can make a new sword if you like...~|~translationMissing
Well, the kingdom is fairly abundant with swords...~|~translationMissing
Well, I hope you find it soon.~|~translationMissing
Yes. You can get bronze swords anywhere. But THIS isn't any old sword.~|~translationMissing
The thing is, this sword is a family heirloom. It has been passed down through Vyvin's family for five generations! It was originally made by the Imcando dwarves, who were~|~translationMissing
a particularly skilled tribe of dwarven smiths. I doubt anyone could make it in the style they do.~|~translationMissing
So would these dwarves make another one?~|~translationMissing
Well I hope you find it soon.~|~translationMissing
Is he angry~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the offer. I'd be surprised if you could though.~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you could try and track down the Imcando dwarves for me? I've got so much work to do...~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll give it a go.~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much! As I say, the best place to start should be with Reldo...~|~translationMissing
No, I've got lots of mining work to do.~|~translationMissing
Oh man... I'm in such trouble...~|~translationMissing
Yes, me too. I'm not looking forward to telling Vyvin I've lost it. He's going to want it for the parade next week as well.~|~translationMissing
Is he angry?~|~translationMissing
He doesn't know yet. I was hoping I could think of something to do before he does find out, But I find myself at a loss.~|~translationMissing
Wouldn't you prefer to be a squire for me?~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, I'm loyal to Sir Vyvin.~|~translationMissing
So how are you doing getting a sword?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Imcando dwarves to help me.~|~translationMissing
Please try and find them quickly... I am scared Sir Vyvin will find out!~|~translationMissing
Are you an Imcando dwarf? I need a special sword.~|~translationMissing
I don't talk about that sort of thing anymore. I'm getting old.~|~translationMissing
I'll come back another time.~|~translationMissing
Hello stranger.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not started Shield of Arrav~|~translationMissing
) (Non-quest dialogue) I'm in search of a quest.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have anything to trade?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) What do you do?~|~translationMissing
What do you know about the Imcando dwarves?~|~translationMissing
You hand over the pie.~|~translationMissing
Thurgo eats the pie.~|~translationMissing
Thurgo pats his stomach.~|~translationMissing
Can you make a special sword for me?~|~translationMissing
Well, after bringing me my favorite food I guess I should give it a go. What sort of sword is it?~|~translationMissing
I need you to make a sword for one of Falador's knights. He had one which was passed down through five generations, but his squire has lost it.~|~translationMissing
So we need an identical one to replace it.~|~translationMissing
A knight's sword eh? Well, I'd need to know exactly how it looked before I could make a new one.~|~translationMissing
All the Faladian knights used to have swords with unique designs according to their position. Could you bring me a picture or something?~|~translationMissing
I'll go and ask his squire and see if I can find one.~|~translationMissing
About that sword...~|~translationMissing
Have you got a picture of the sword for me yet?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, not yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has a redberry pie~|~translationMissing
) (Non-quest dialogue) Would you like a redberry pie?~|~translationMissing
I've found an Imcando dwarf but he needs a picture of the sword before he can make it.~|~translationMissing
A picture eh? Hmmm.... The only one I can think of is in a small portrait of Sir Vyvin's father... Sir Vyvin keeps it in a cupboard in his room I think.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll try and get that then.~|~translationMissing
Please don't let him catch you! He MUSTN'T know what happened!~|~translationMissing
I didn't get the picture yet.~|~translationMissing
Please try and get it quickly... I am scared Sir Vyvin will find out!~|~translationMissing
I have the picture. I'll just take it to the dwarf now!~|~translationMissing
I have found a picture of the sword I would like you to make.~|~translationMissing
You give the Portrait to Thurgo. Thurgo studies the portrait.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Portrait.)~|~translationMissing
You'll need to get me some stuff to make this. I'll need two iron bars to make the sword, to start with. I'll also need an ore called blurite.~|~translationMissing
Blurite is useless for making actual weapons, except crossbows, but I'll need some as decoration for the hilt.~|~translationMissing
It is a fairly rare ore. The only place I know to get it is under this cliff here, but it is guarded by a very powerful ice giant.~|~translationMissing
Most of the rocks in that cliff are pretty useless, and don't contain much of anything, but there's DEFINITELY some blurite in there.~|~translationMissing
You'll need a little bit of mining experience to be able to find it.~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll go and find them then.~|~translationMissing
I've found a dwarf who will make the sword. I've just got to find the materials for it now!~|~translationMissing
Can you make that replacement sword now?~|~translationMissing
How are you doing finding those sword materials?~|~translationMissing
I don't have any of them yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, I need a blurite ore and two iron bars. The only place I know to get blurite is under this cliff here, but it is guarded by a very powerful ice giant.~|~translationMissing
I don't have any blurite ore yet.~|~translationMissing
Better go get some then, huh? The only place I know to get it is under this cliff here, but it is guarded by a very powerful ice giant.~|~translationMissing
I don't have two iron bars.~|~translationMissing
Better go get some then, huh?~|~translationMissing
You give the blurite ore and iron bars to Thurgo. Thurgo makes you a sword.~|~translationMissing
Just remember to call in with more pie some time!~|~translationMissing
Thanks for making that sword for me!~|~translationMissing
You're welcome - thanks for the pie!~|~translationMissing
If the player is wielding the sword~|~translationMissing
I have retrieved your sword for you.~|~translationMissing
So can you un-equip it and hand it over to me now please?~|~translationMissing
If the sword is in the player's inventory~|~translationMissing
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I was seriously worried I would have to own up to Sir Vyvin!~|~translationMissing
You give the sword to the squire.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives Blurite sword.)~|~translationMissing

5.4 Cut scene~|~translationMissing
A meeting of leaders~|~translationMissing
There was recently some damage to the castle cellar. Part of the wall has collapsed.~|~translationMissing
The Duke insists that it was an earthquake, but I think some kind of monsters are to blame.~|~translationMissing
Start The Lost Tribe quest?~|~translationMissing
You should ask people around the town about it. Maybe someone saw something.~|~translationMissing
How is the adventuring going, my friend?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Do you have any other quests for me?~|~translationMissing
Do you know what happened in the castle cellar?~|~translationMissing
Oh no, it's terrible, isn't it? There was rock dust everywhere, it got on all my ingredients!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I am getting strong and mighty.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I keep on dying.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I use your range?~|~translationMissing
Hans~|~translationMissing
Hello. What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Do you know what happened in the cellar?~|~translationMissing
The wall collapsed. I had to spend all day clearing it up! The Duke says it was an earthquake.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I have come to kill everyone in this castle!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I don't know. I'm lost. Where am I?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you tell me how long I've been here?~|~translationMissing
Last night I was in the kitchen and I heard a noise from the cellar. I opened the trapdoor and saw a creature dart into a hole in the wall.~|~translationMissing
It looked a bit like a goblin, but it had big bulging eyes. It wasn't wearing armour, but it had this odd helmet with a light on it.~|~translationMissing
The tunnel was too dark for me to follow it, so I went to tell the Duke. But when we went down to the cellar the hole had been blocked up, and no one believes me.~|~translationMissing
I believe you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [player name]! If you can convince the Duke I'm telling the truth then we can get to the bottom of this mystery.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Give me a quest!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Have you anything to sell?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you repair my items for me?~|~translationMissing
Bob says he saw something in the cellar~|~translationMissing
Bob says he saw something in the cellar. Like a goblin with big eyes.~|~translationMissing
Yes, he mentioned that to me. But I think he was imagining things. Goblins live in natural caves but everyone knows they don't have the wit to make their own tunnels.~|~translationMissing
Yes your grace, but if there is any possibility that this is a goblin incursion then we should take that possibility very seriously!~|~translationMissing
I think we should at least investigate.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Dragon Slayer I~|~translationMissing
Your grace, this is the adventurer who defeated the dragon Elvarg. I think you should listen to him.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, very well. I give you permission to investigate this mystery. If there is a blocked tunnel then perhaps you should try to un-block it.~|~translationMissing
You dig a narrow tunnel through the rocks.~|~translationMissing
I dug through the rubble...~|~translationMissing
I dug through the rubble in the cellar and found a tunnel!~|~translationMissing
On the ground I found this brooch.~|~translationMissing
I've never seen anything like that before. It doesn't come from Lumbridge. What do you think, Sigmund?~|~translationMissing
It is unknown to me, your grace. But the fact it is there is enough to prove Bob's story. It must have been dropped by a goblin as it fled.~|~translationMissing
I've never heard of a goblin wearing something so well- crafted.~|~translationMissing
Then it must have been stolen!~|~translationMissing
But it wasn't stolen from us. Where could it be from?~|~translationMissing
That doesn't matter! You said yourself that goblins couldn't have made that, so they must have stolen it from somewhere.~|~translationMissing
Horrible, thieving goblins have broken into our cellar! We must retaliate immediately!~|~translationMissing
First we should wipe out the goblins east of the river, then we can march on the goblin village to the north- west...~|~translationMissing
I will not commit troops until I have proof that goblins are behind this.~|~translationMissing
[Player name], please find out what you can about this brooch. The librarian in Varrock might be able to help identify the symbol.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the brooch.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about this brooch?~|~translationMissing
I've never seen that symbol before. Where did you find it?~|~translationMissing
In a cave beneath Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
Very odd. Have you any idea how it got there?~|~translationMissing
A goblin might have dropped it.~|~translationMissing
I've never heard of a goblin carrying a brooch like this. But just a minute...~|~translationMissing
The other day I filed a book about ancient goblin tribes. It's somewhere at the west end of the library, I think. Maybe that will be of some use.~|~translationMissing
'A History of the Goblin Race'. This must be it.~|~translationMissing
You take the book from the bookcase.~|~translationMissing
(The player flips through the book's pages. Fortunately, there are pictures.)~|~translationMissing
Hey... The symbol of the 'Dorgeshuun' tribe looks just like the symbol on the brooch I found.~|~translationMissing
Have you ever heard of the Dorgeshuun?~|~translationMissing
Dorgeshuun? That old goblin legend. Lost tribe.~|~translationMissing
In time of much-war there many tribes. Big High War- God send Dorgesh tribe to fight beardy-short-people in mountains.~|~translationMissing
No no, he send them to fight tall people with biting blades, that what I hear.~|~translationMissing
It was beardy-short-people, that how legend go.~|~translationMissing
Make up your minds!~|~translationMissing
It was tall people! That what old storyteller say!~|~translationMissing
No, beardy-short-people. That how legend always go, stupid.~|~translationMissing
You stupid!~|~translationMissing
Do you want me to decide for you again?~|~translationMissing
That most stupid idea yet. If it happen it either happen one way or the other. You can't just decide which.~|~translationMissing
Yeah even goblins know that.~|~translationMissing
It doesn't really matter~|~translationMissing
It doesn't really matter. What happened to them?~|~translationMissing
Well, they say, 'We not want to fight,' so god punish them.~|~translationMissing
That silly. No goblin ever say that.~|~translationMissing
What happen then?~|~translationMissing
They lose battle, that why god punish them.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha! If they lost battle they all be dead!~|~translationMissing
No no, they losing so they run away, and Big High War-God punish them for running away.~|~translationMissing
Who were they fighting again?~|~translationMissing
It was beardy-short-people in mountains.~|~translationMissing
No no, it was tall people.~|~translationMissing
What kind of god would punish them for refusing to fight?~|~translationMissing
Shh! Must not question Big High War-God!~|~translationMissing
No, because he much bigger than us.~|~translationMissing
Well either way they refused to fight~|~translationMissing
Well either way they refused to fight.~|~translationMissing
Yeah I suppose so.~|~translationMissing
Anyway then Big High War-God punish them. He turn their insides to stone.~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha! That silly!~|~translationMissing
Not as silly as green armour! What happen then?~|~translationMissing
He put them inside stone! Big hole open in ground and they all go into cave.~|~translationMissing
That not punishment! Caves nice and cool.~|~translationMissing
But then he close cave so they not get out! You not want to stay in cave all the time.~|~translationMissing
Why were they punished again?~|~translationMissing
Why were there punished again?~|~translationMissing
It because they run away from fight.~|~translationMissing
No, it because they refuse to fight night before battle.~|~translationMissing
So do goblins make their own tunnels?~|~translationMissing
What? Make our own tunnels?~|~translationMissing
We hadn't thought of that.~|~translationMissing
Well I found a brooch underground...~|~translationMissing
Well I found a brooch underground, and I looked up the symbol and it was the symbol of the Dorgeshuun.~|~translationMissing
That not look like goblin brooch.~|~translationMissing
Goblins not wear jewellery.~|~translationMissing
Well if it Dorgeshuun tribe they not know who won big wars. You should greet them with goblin victory dance!~|~translationMissing
No no, you greet them with goblin tribal bow.~|~translationMissing
Doing bow make you look like a wimp.~|~translationMissing
It how tribes greet each other in old days.~|~translationMissing
Only if they wimpy tribes! Goblin salute strong!~|~translationMissing
So why is the Dorgeshuun tribe underground?~|~translationMissing
They punished by Big High War-God.~|~translationMissing
Wait, you say YOU won the big wars?~|~translationMissing
Well we must have done! We goblins! Goblins always win!~|~translationMissing
Actually we not know who won.~|~translationMissing
It was goblins I say!~|~translationMissing
Well why not show me both greetings?~|~translationMissing
That good idea. Watch.~|~translationMissing
The goblins show you the Goblin Victory Salute and Goblin Bow.~|~translationMissing
Thanks~|~translationMissing
Bye then.~|~translationMissing
Bye.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I seek a shield that will protect me from dragonbreath.~|~translationMissing
I spoke to the generals in the goblin village...~|~translationMissing
I spoke to the goblin generals in the goblin village. They told me about an ancient goblin tribe that went to live underground.~|~translationMissing
What more proof do we need? Nasty, smelly goblins have been living under our feet all this time! We must crush them at once!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, perhaps you are right. I will send word to the army to prepare for an underground assault.~|~translationMissing
Kelsew, I would still like you to find out more about this tribe. It cannot hurt to know one's enemy.~|~translationMissing
I spoke to the generals in the Goblin Village...~|~translationMissing
I spoke to the goblin generals in the Goblin Village. They told me about an ancient goblin tribe that went to live underground.~|~translationMissing
I don't see how there can be any more doubt. You should tell the Duke at once!~|~translationMissing
Who...who are you? How did you get in here?~|~translationMissing
Help! A surface-dweller this deep in our mines? We will all be destroyed!~|~translationMissing
If the player performs the Goblin Bow emote~|~translationMissing
A human knows ancient greeting?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you are friend after all!~|~translationMissing
Greetings, friend. I am sorry I panicked when I saw you.~|~translationMissing
Our legends tell of the surface as a place of horror and violence, where the gods forced us to fight in terrible battles.~|~translationMissing
When I saw a surface-dweller appear I was afraid it was a return to the old days!~|~translationMissing
Did you break in to the castle cellar?~|~translationMissing
It was an accident. We were following a seam of iron and suddenly we found ourselves in a room!~|~translationMissing
We blocked up our tunnel behind us and ran back here. Then we did what cave goblins always do when there is a problem~|~translationMissing
we hid and hoped it would go away.~|~translationMissing
We meant no harm! Please tell the ruler of the above- people that we want to make peace.~|~translationMissing
Hello, friend?~|~translationMissing
May I mine the rocks here?~|~translationMissing
No offence, but we will not let you mine here until there is peace between the humans and the Dorgeshuun.~|~translationMissing
Why do the Dorgeshuun live underground?~|~translationMissing
Our ancient legends say that goblins were created by an evil god in order to fight in a huge war. This god sent the Dorgeshuun tribe to fight a battle where all would die.~|~translationMissing
But our ancestors escaped by hiding in a deep hole in the ground where our god could not find us. Eventually an earthquake sealed the hole and they were forever safe.~|~translationMissing
The war is over now, so you can return to the surface.~|~translationMissing
Even if the gods are no longer at war, I find it hard to believe that a tribe of peaceful goblins would be safe above. I have heard of humans coming down into the caves to slaughter our people!~|~translationMissing
But even if we could return, we would not want to. We are adapted to living underground, and we have built a home for ourselves that we do not want to leave.~|~translationMissing
What was the name of your god?~|~translationMissing
Our ancestors did not speak his name, thinking that to do so would attract his attention. His name has been unspoken for so long that it is now entirely forgotten.~|~translationMissing
That is for the best. We have survived perfectly well without gods, and we do not want a return to the old ways.~|~translationMissing
What happened to your arm?~|~translationMissing
I lost it in a mining accident a few years ago.~|~translationMissing
This area is very unstable. That's why we put markers on the wall showing the safest path.~|~translationMissing
Can you show me the way out of the mines?~|~translationMissing
Certainly. Please hurry, you must avert the war!~|~translationMissing
Is this your brooch?~|~translationMissing
We have more important things to think about than a brooch right now. We must prevent a war!~|~translationMissing
I've made contact with the cave goblins...~|~translationMissing
I've made contact with the cave goblins. They say they were following a seam and broke into the cellar by mistake.~|~translationMissing
And I suppose you believe them, goblin-lover?~|~translationMissing
Well, they seemed friendlier than most goblins, and nothing was taken from the cellar.~|~translationMissing
Actually, something was taken. Sigmund has informed me that some of the castle silverware is missing from the cellar.~|~translationMissing
Unless it is returned, I am afraid I will have no option but war.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the silverware that was stolen.~|~translationMissing
The priceless Lumbridge Silverware! It comes out only on special occasions. It was kept in storage in the cellar, but now the goblins have stolen it.~|~translationMissing
So why did no one notice earlier?~|~translationMissing
That doesn't matter. You'll never find it, because the goblins took it. So you can't stop the war!~|~translationMissing
Some silverware has gone missing from the castle cellar...~|~translationMissing
Some silverware has gone missing from the castle, and the Duke thinks you stole it!~|~translationMissing
Oh no! We would never do such a thing!~|~translationMissing
I assure you we took nothing from the cellar. You must convince the Duke we are innocent!~|~translationMissing
Where is the silverware you stole from the castle cellar?~|~translationMissing
Where's the silverware you stole from the castle cellar?~|~translationMissing
What? We didn't take anything!~|~translationMissing
You expect me to believe that? Perhaps Sigmund was right~|~translationMissing
you're just thieving little goblins!~|~translationMissing
Why would we want to steal silver? As you see we have much silver already in our mines!~|~translationMissing
Well, the Duke says he will attack you unless the silverware is returned.~|~translationMissing
The last thing we want is war! If we had anything of yours, we would return it at once. But we don't!~|~translationMissing
You steal a little key.~|~translationMissing
In the chest you find a set of H.A.M. robes!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund must be a member of the Humans Against Monsters cult!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the key~|~translationMissing
You don't have the key to open this chest.~|~translationMissing
You're a H.A.M. member, aren't you?~|~translationMissing
You're a H.A.M member, aren't you?~|~translationMissing
Well, so what if I am? It's not a crime.~|~translationMissing
Did you know Sigmund is a member of HAM?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I had suspected it. But however much I disapprove of the HAM movement it's not actually illegal. I'll keep an eye on him though.~|~translationMissing
You find the Lumbridge Silverware!~|~translationMissing
Actually I have found it! You put it in the H.A.M. cave!~|~translationMissing
I... I... You're lying! I don't know what you're talking about.~|~translationMissing
I found the missing silverware in the HAM cave!~|~translationMissing
Sigmund! Is this your doing?~|~translationMissing
Of...of course not! The goblins must have, um, dropped the silverware as they ran away.~|~translationMissing
Don't lie to me! I knew you were a HAM member but I didn't think you would stoop to this. You are dismissed from my service.~|~translationMissing
But don't you see it was for the best? For goblins to be living under our feet like this... ugh. It doesn't matter how civilized they are~|~translationMissing
all sub-human species must be wiped out!~|~translationMissing
That's enough! Get out of my castle now!~|~translationMissing
I see I was ill-advised. Unless there is an act of aggression by the cave goblins there is no need for war.~|~translationMissing
The Duke writes a document and signs it.~|~translationMissing
This peace treaty specifies the border between Lumbridge and the Cave Goblin realm. Please take it to the cave goblins and tell them I would like to meet with their leader to sign it.~|~translationMissing
You were taking the peace treaty to the cave goblins.~|~translationMissing
I have a peace treaty from the Duke of Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
A peace treaty? Then you will not invade?~|~translationMissing
No. As long as you stick to the terms of this treaty there will be no conflict. The Duke of Lumbridge wants to meet your ruler to sign it.~|~translationMissing
I will summon Ur-tag, our headman, at once.~|~translationMissing
Fade to black and a cutscene starts~|~translationMissing
~ The Signing of the Lumbridge-Dorgeshuun Treaty ~~|~translationMissing
Your grace, I present Ur-tag, headman of the Dorgeshuun.~|~translationMissing
Welcome, Ur-tag. I am sorry that your race came under suspicion.~|~translationMissing
I assure you that the warmongering element has been dealt with.~|~translationMissing
I apologize for the damage to your cellar. I will send workers to repair the hole.~|~translationMissing
No, let it stay. It can be a route of commerce between our lands.~|~translationMissing
[Player name], Lumbridge is in your debt. Please accept this ring as a token of my thanks.~|~translationMissing
It is enchanted to save you in your hour of need.~|~translationMissing
The Duke hands the player a Ring of Life.~|~translationMissing
I too thank you. Accept the freedom of the Dorgeshuun mines.~|~translationMissing
These are strange times. I never dreamed that I would see the surface, still less that I would be on friendly terms with its people.~|~translationMissing
The camera pans out to reveal Sigmund eavesdropping beyond the doors.~|~translationMissing
Prattle on, goblin.~|~translationMissing
Soon you will be destroyed!~|~translationMissing

Hello again, Bolren.~|~translationMissing
King Bolren~|~translationMissing
Hello there. It's good to see you again.~|~translationMissing
I see you have a new pet.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you've met Dumpling.~|~translationMissing
Dumpling? I suppose it looks a little bit like a dumpling...~|~translationMissing
An evil six-legged dumpling!~|~translationMissing
Hey! Dumpling isn't evil. She has cute ears and a little bobbly tail!~|~translationMissing
Start The Path of Glouphrie quest?~|~translationMissing
Look at it! It's clearly evil. It has six legs!~|~translationMissing
And those eyes... those black, black eyes... If you stare into them, you can see into its black soul!~|~translationMissing
Ahem, anyway, that's not how I know this creature is evil. I've seen one before, and I'm afraid I have some bad news.~|~translationMissing
I came across some creatures like Dumpling at the Gnome Stronghold. They're evil things created using dark magic.~|~translationMissing
If this is anything like the situation at the Gnome Stronghold, then Dumpling was sent by Glouphrie to wheedle itself into your affections and spy on you.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid so. The creature is shrouded by illusion magic to make it look like a cute pet, but in reality it's this horrible... black spiky thing.~|~translationMissing
It's watching you all the time, sending details of all your secret dealings back to Glouphrie.~|~translationMissing
You've been listening to too many gnomish children's stories! Glouphrie hasn't been seen since before I was King. He's almost certainly long-dead by now.~|~translationMissing
Well, what if I were to prove it to you? I unmasked the creatures at the Gnome Stronghold using a machine created by Oaknock the Engineer. Maybe I could do it again.~|~translationMissing
It's going to need to be very solid proof for me to just cast Dumpling aside. She's become my constant companion!~|~translationMissing
Oh it will be solid. I just need an anti-illusion device... I don't suppose you have one of those around here?~|~translationMissing
I don't think so. What does one look like?~|~translationMissing
A big machine made out of wood and crystal.~|~translationMissing
Crystal? As in elven crystal? I haven't seen any elven crystal around here since...~|~translationMissing
Since?~|~translationMissing
Since Yewnock came to visit!~|~translationMissing
Yewnock?~|~translationMissing
Oaknock's son, of course! This was a long time ago, before I was even King, but if anyone would have had a device made by Oaknock, it would have been his own son!~|~translationMissing
So perhaps there's a device nearby. When he was here, where did Yewnock spend a lot of his time?~|~translationMissing
He did a lot of work down in the caves. I think he liked how nice and quiet it was down there.~|~translationMissing
It sounds like I need to pay Golrie a visit. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Well... if you're sure.~|~translationMissing
Did you have a look down in the caves?~|~translationMissing
Not yet. I'll head down there now and see if Golrie can give me a hand.~|~translationMissing
Hello, Golrie. How's it going?~|~translationMissing
Golrie~|~translationMissing
Better now I'm on the right side of these bars.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Found anything interesting recently?~|~translationMissing
I need your help with a device.~|~translationMissing
A device?~|~translationMissing
That's right. One made using elven crystal.~|~translationMissing
Ah, well I've got plenty of elven stuff. It's all lying around here somewhere.~|~translationMissing
Why do you have so much? Are you some sort of collector?~|~translationMissing
Not me, my grandfather. At least, he used to be. I'm not sure whether he's still alive or not. He hasn't sent me any souvenirs for a while now.~|~translationMissing
Souvenirs?~|~translationMissing
That's right. He was a funny gnome, old gramps. He got into a bit of... trouble a while back and couldn't really stick around. He ended up travelling the world collecting elven artefacts after that.~|~translationMissing
It used to be a monthly occurence. A terrorbird would turn up with a big parcel and I'd throw it in with the other stuff in the storeroom. It's a bit of a mess now in there.~|~translationMissing
Storeroom? Could I take a look?~|~translationMissing
Oh, certainly. I should really sort through all of his things at some point. There's probably some quite cool stuff in there.~|~translationMissing
Have a look in the other chamber and you'll find a small tunnel into the storeroom.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I lost that pebble.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I use your key?~|~translationMissing
Did you check the storeroom? You can get to it through the small tunnel in the other chamber.~|~translationMissing
I'll take a look. Thanks.~|~translationMissing
Bolrie~|~translationMissing
When I became King of the Tree Gnome Village, I thought I was lucky, for I did so during a time of peace. However, it seemed that peace was not to last.~|~translationMissing
Human activity in the area was increasing, and conflict between our two races seemed inevitable.~|~translationMissing
Fearing the worst, I had my trusted advisor reach out to King Healthorg of the Gnome Stronghold, but his response left much to be desired...~|~translationMissing
King Bolrie is seen with his advisor, walking towards him.~|~translationMissing
Advisor~|~translationMissing
My King, we have received word from King Healthorg.~|~translationMissing
King Bolrie~|~translationMissing
Finally! How long before we can expect his support?~|~translationMissing
He will not be sending any support, my King. He does not wish to start a conflict with the humans.~|~translationMissing
What? But can't he see what will happen if we don't act now! The humans will destroy us!~|~translationMissing
I have conversed with the spirit trees, my King, and they are in full agreement. Without action, the humans will be our doom.~|~translationMissing
Healthorg has become a weak old fool! He's blind to our problems.~|~translationMissing
All may not be lost. I hear his illness is progressing. Soon, the Gnome Stronghold will need to pick a new ruler.~|~translationMissing
They'll almost certainly pick his son, but Argenthorg is just as bad as his father. If he becomes King, he will only appease the humans!~|~translationMissing
Then perhaps they need presenting with an alternate option.~|~translationMissing
Yes... perhaps they do.~|~translationMissing
A statue of King Healthorg is shown.~|~translationMissing
And so the reign of the most famous gnome king came to an end.~|~translationMissing
With Healthorg gone, voting on his replacement would soon begin. Many expected his son, Argenthorg, to be the only serious contender.~|~translationMissing
But my advisor and I had other ideas...~|~translationMissing
Posters are posted showing Bolrie and Argenthorg campaigning for the election.~|~translationMissing
Despite our best attempts, Argenthorg looked certain to win the election.~|~translationMissing
Healthorg was a great king far longer than he was a weak one. Everyone assumed his son would be as great as he was.~|~translationMissing
We needed to show them the truth. We needed to show them that Argenthorg was weak. My advisor said he knew how...~|~translationMissing
A saboteur appears and places illusions of human produce and poultry on the tables in the Grand Tree, in proximity of Argenthorg. The advisor and King Bolrie enter the room.~|~translationMissing
Argenthorg... this is human food!~|~translationMissing
So it's true! A gnome who loves humans more than his own kind!~|~translationMissing
Argenthorg~|~translationMissing
I don't understand! What is this?~|~translationMissing
The truth is out now, Argenthorg. You are not fit to be a king!~|~translationMissing
This is all a lie! I've been framed!~|~translationMissing
The evidence is right in front of us, Argenthorg.~|~translationMissing
Wait... I know what this is! Father warned me about this!~|~translationMissing
Guards! Seek out Yewnock at once. Tell him to switch the machine on!~|~translationMissing
The scene switches to Yewnock the Engineer, calibrating and activating his anti-illusion machine. The scene cuts back to the advisor and King Bolrie, where the advisor slowly transforms into Glouphrie the Untrusted.~|~translationMissing
Glouphrie!~|~translationMissing
No! I don't believe it. I trusted you!~|~translationMissing
You only have yourself to blame, Bolrie. I simply told you what you wanted to hear. Never forget that...~|~translationMissing
There ended my campaign to become the new king of the Gnome Stronghold. Argenthorg was crowned soon after and Glouphrie disappeared once more.~|~translationMissing
I don't know what the gnomes of the Tree Gnome Village will think once they hear what I've done, but it does not matter. They deserve a better ruler than I.~|~translationMissing
And so I am preparing to leave the lands of my people. Foul illusions cannot be allowed to shame us gnomes again.~|~translationMissing
The one who chooses to practise such dark arts will be punished. I will make it my life's purpose...~|~translationMissing
Well, it sadly seems you were right. Please get rid of the nasty creature. Then we can talk.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for dealing with that... thing. I apologise for not believing you before.~|~translationMissing
While I am glad the matter has been sorted, I must admit that this situation has me quite concerned. You said that there were many of these creatures posted all around the Gnome Stronghold?~|~translationMissing
That's right. There were six.~|~translationMissing
Why did Glouphrie send so many there, but only one here?~|~translationMissing
Maybe he thought it was more important to spy on the Gnome Stronghold and Narnode.~|~translationMissing
That's outrageous! The Gnome Stronghold is not six times more important than our village here! He should have sent at least four watchers, maybe five!~|~translationMissing
So you want more evil watchers?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes. I mean no, of course not. Still, Glouphrie has a lot to answer for! If I ever get my hands on him I'll... er... I'll give him a good talking to!~|~translationMissing
Right... Well, maybe we should start by trying to find him.~|~translationMissing
Yes, of course! Still, that won't be an easy feat. It is said that after Glouphrie was driven out of our lands, he founded the hidden city of Arposandra. To find him, we must first find Arposandra!~|~translationMissing
And nobody knows where Arposandra is. Not a great start.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Many a gnome has tried and failed to find the city. Some, like Longramble, are still out there searching for it.~|~translationMissing
Longramble?~|~translationMissing
Yes, one of my citizens. Longramble is a bit of an explorer. He's been out there searching for Arposandra for some time.~|~translationMissing
Did he offer any suggestion of where he thought it might be?~|~translationMissing
He said that he was sure Arposandra was somewhere between here and the edge of the world.~|~translationMissing
Okay... that doesn't really help.~|~translationMissing
No, I suppose not. Still, if you want to find Arposandra, finding Longramble might not be a bad place to start.~|~translationMissing
But how would I find him?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure, but I bet Aluft Gianne jnr. could help. His restaurant can supposedly deliver food to any gnome, no matter where they are.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like the best option then. We just have to hope Longramble didn't end up finding the edge of the world and falling off.~|~translationMissing
You'll find Aluft Gianne jnr. in his restaurant at the Grand Tree. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
Oh, and if you find Glouphrie, tell him... tell him... I'm very angry with him!~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Any luck finding Longramble?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure Aluft Gianne jnr. can help. You'll find him in his restaurant at the Grand Tree. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm ready to take an order now...~|~translationMissing
I need your help finding a certain gnome.~|~translationMissing
Gianne jnr.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that's sensitive information you know. Who is this gnome?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Longramble, the explorer.~|~translationMissing
Ah, well, that might be different. I have a long-standing order for Longramble. Problem is, no one has been able to reach him.~|~translationMissing
So you know where he is?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes! I have his coordinates, but I can't find them on my Doogle Maps. Two degrees, seven minutes south. Three degrees, seven minutes west.~|~translationMissing
Doogle Maps?~|~translationMissing
Of course! My maps are all on dried doogle leaves.~|~translationMissing
Right, I guess I'd better get hunting. Sounds like I'll be needing a sextant, watch and chart.~|~translationMissing
Oh, if you do find Longramble, I'd appreciate it if you could deliver his order to him. He's requested some tasty tangled toad's legs.~|~translationMissing
Could you remind me of Longramble's coordinates?~|~translationMissing
Two degrees, seven minutes south. Three degrees, seven minutes west.~|~translationMissing
If you do find Longramble, I'd appreciate it if you could deliver his order to him. He's requested some tasty tangled toad's legs.~|~translationMissing
If the player has tangled toad's legs in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You hand over the tangled toads' legs to the very grateful-looking gnome. He stuffs them straight into his mouth and hands you a mint cake in return.~|~translationMissing
(Player gives tangled toad's legs.)~|~translationMissing
(Player receives mint cake.)~|~translationMissing
Mr Longramble, I presume?~|~translationMissing
Longramble~|~translationMissing
Trouble speaking? You're not one of those gnomes like Hazelmere that only speaks in ancient gnomish, are you?~|~translationMissing
No... It's just... It's been so long! All this time with only myself for company!~|~translationMissing
Well, it looks like you have some new company now. I'm [player name], and I've been looking for you.~|~translationMissing
I'm hoping you've found something that I'm also looking for.~|~translationMissing
Do you mean the edge of the world? It's been my life's ambition to find it and be the first gnome to stare over its edge.~|~translationMissing
Edge? Are you sure there's an edge? I've heard it goes on forever.~|~translationMissing
Everything has an edge. Eventually I'll find it. I'll keep heading westwards until I get there.~|~translationMissing
If the world is spherical though, you'll never find the edge.~|~translationMissing
Spherical? Don't be silly! The world is clearly flat. If it was ball-shaped, we'd all roll off the side. Silly human.~|~translationMissing
Maybe the world is round, but there's some magical force that makes us stick to the ground.~|~translationMissing
Now you're just making fun of me. I don't think you realise the gravity of the situation!~|~translationMissing
Right... Anyway, that's not why I'm here. I thought you were looking for the hidden city of Arposandra?~|~translationMissing
That is true, but I'm only doing that as a detour from my journey to the edge of the world. I figured it would be on the way.~|~translationMissing
And have you had any luck?~|~translationMissing
I think so. There's a waste outlet nearby that I believe may be coming from the city of Arposandra!~|~translationMissing
What makes you think that?~|~translationMissing
Well, have a look for yourself. There's a huge swamp of nasty goo out west that definitely isn't natural. It's coming from that outlet.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't mean it's coming from Arposandra though.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, but there is one other thing. The outlet appears to be patrolled by a creature that suggests gnomish involvement... A giant tortoise!~|~translationMissing
Okay, that sounds a lot more promising.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! The thing is, there seems to be something wrong with it. It seems... unwell.~|~translationMissing
It has some large tentacles growing from underneath its shell.~|~translationMissing
Tentacles? That's more than unwell, that's... warped!~|~translationMissing
Well, whatever you call it, it's not normal. Maybe it's an illness caused by Glouphrie's magic.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I'd better have a look myself.~|~translationMissing
Go for it. The outlet isn't hard to find. It's just to the west.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Where did you say that outlet was?~|~translationMissing
It's just to the west of here. Shouldn't be too hard to find.~|~translationMissing
So alone... My brethren cannot hear me...~|~translationMissing
Er... hello... Was that you calling me?~|~translationMissing
Spirit Tree~|~translationMissing
The tree whisperer has come to my aid. Thank Guthix.~|~translationMissing
Do you have a name?~|~translationMissing
You may call me Incomitatus, for I am alone and friendless. You are not a small person of Guthix. How do you speak with me?~|~translationMissing
Er... I don't know. Can't anyone just speak to you?~|~translationMissing
Only those who have opened their minds to the spirits of the earth can talk with spirit trees. You surely must have been trained by a great friend to us, as this is a gift not easily come by.~|~translationMissing
Well, it's true that I have spoken to the odd tree in the past...~|~translationMissing
Oh, wait a minute, this reminds me of something. Hazelmere did something like this to me a while ago. You know, talking using the mind.~|~translationMissing
The one you call Hazelmere... he is a friend of trees. He would be able to help me.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could help in some way. What exactly is wrong with you?~|~translationMissing
I have lost my connection to the Anima Mundi. The earth has corrupted my roots and they find only black ichor. My xylem and phloem are tainted. I am alone.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I'm sure there's a way to fix this. What would Hazelmere do?~|~translationMissing
What? What do you want? You shouldn't disturb me like that. I was deep in contemplation. Looking into the future is not something you can do on a whim, you know!~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere?~|~translationMissing
Yes of course! You did call for me, didn't you? And what did I tell you about flapping your lips during a mind meld? Use your brain!~|~translationMissing
Right, sorry.~|~translationMissing
Now, this had best be important. I was in the middle of a dream, a vision of the future. There was something I was meant to see...~|~translationMissing
It's good to hear you're still as grumpy as always.~|~translationMissing
Hmph! How did you manage to perform a mind meld from so far away anyway? Such skills are far beyond a human. Unless...~|~translationMissing
Of course, a spirit tree. I sense this one to be rather unwell. What happened?~|~translationMissing
Alright, let me try to sense the problem.~|~translationMissing
The screen fades to black, and Incomitatus is seen rotating slowly anti-clockwise.~|~translationMissing
Right, all done. Ah, and it seems you haven't suffered any permanent damage. That's fortunate.~|~translationMissing
Fortunate? You didn't warn me of any risk before giving me that nightmare!~|~translationMissing
You have a strong spirit. I assumed you'd be alright. And, after all, it's the spirit tree that really matters. You'll only live for a handful of decades. The tree should live for centuries.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure I approve of your low regard for my welfare.~|~translationMissing
The welfare of the tree is our concern right now. Something has poisoned the soil, blocking the tree's connection with the Anima Mundi. This is worrying in itself.~|~translationMissing
Well, no ordinary poison could do this. Only by separating the Anima Mundi from its source...~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, you're confusing me.~|~translationMissing
I forget I'm dealing with a human. I'll spell it out nice and clearly for you. The Anima Mundi is created by all natural things. It is their soul, and a sort of natural energy.~|~translationMissing
It is powerful and dangerous, and only by the balance of Guthix does it remain in check. Creatures live, creatures die. The balance is maintained.~|~translationMissing
So how has this caused Incomitatus to become ill?~|~translationMissing
Powerful magics could be used to separate the Anima Mundi from its source. This would produce a great deal of power, power that could be used in an unbridled way.~|~translationMissing
However, doing so would unbalance the whole pattern of life. The ichor in the soil appears to be the unnatural waste product of such tinkerings.~|~translationMissing
There is a huge evil-smelling swamp of tar just to the west of here. Is that related?~|~translationMissing
Most likely, but to make enough of this ichor to create a swamp would take an enormous amount of work and would create a dizzying amount of energy.~|~translationMissing
It would be an abomination, to plunder the earth in such a massive way. Who would need to do this?~|~translationMissing
Glouphrie?~|~translationMissing
Hmph, maybe. Anyway, our immediate problem is to help our spirit brethren.~|~translationMissing
Is there some sort of antidote I could give to the tree?~|~translationMissing
If you had been paying attention, you'd remember that I said this is no normal poison. Some sort of spiritual cleansing will be needed in order to return the spirit tree's connection to the Anima Mundi.~|~translationMissing
I do not have the power to do this kind of thing. This will require elven magic. A pure note, created by elven crystal, would have a purifying effect on anything nearby.~|~translationMissing
Luckily, you seem to already be carrying the answer.~|~translationMissing
How do you know what I'm carrying?~|~translationMissing
Oh, mind meld. Of course.~|~translationMissing
Use your crystal chime to try and cleanse the tree. Let us hope this works.~|~translationMissing
Right, I'll give it a go.~|~translationMissing
I sense that you haven't yet managed to cleanse the tree? What is holding you up?~|~translationMissing
How am I meant to do it?~|~translationMissing
Just use your crystal chime.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays in which the player uses the chimes and Incomitatus is healed to perfect health.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, tree whisperer. I can feel the Anima Mundi once more.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, not a bad job I guess. Now be on your way, I have meditating to do.~|~translationMissing
A cutscene plays in which two Terrorbird Guards are guarding a door.~|~translationMissing
Terrorbird Guard 21~|~translationMissing
So, how did you get this ropey old job then, Seventy Two?~|~translationMissing
Terrorbird Guard 72~|~translationMissing
I think it's a punishment, Twenty One.~|~translationMissing
I fell asleep while guarding upstairs.~|~translationMissing
You fell asleep? I thought the masters made it impossible for us to fall asleep.~|~translationMissing
I dunno, maybe I'm defective. I blame the masters myself. Anyway, I got the choice, either take this job or go outside.~|~translationMissing
Outside?! I don't even want to think about it!~|~translationMissing
Still, at least you got to guard upstairs! Things are always happening up there. I've been down here since I was de-podded and nothing happens down here.~|~translationMissing
You'd have thought the masters would make it impossible for us to get bored as well.~|~translationMissing
You'd think so, but they always seem to be making a mess of the pods. After all, you've seen how many failures get dumped outside.~|~translationMissing
Wait! Did you hear something?~|~translationMissing
Calm down, nothing ever-~|~translationMissing
Terrorbird Guard 72 begins to panic.~|~translationMissing
There's someone outside! What do we do?~|~translationMissing
Terrorbird Guard 21 begins to panic.~|~translationMissing
Press the red button! Quickly!~|~translationMissing
They told us to never press the red button!~|~translationMissing
Unless it's an emergency! Press the red button. Now!~|~translationMissing
Don't panic!~|~translationMissing
I'm not panicking, you're panicking! Press the red button!~|~translationMissing
Terrorbird Guard 21 presses the alarm button.~|~translationMissing
This might be a problem...~|~translationMissing
The player turns around to see the room now filled with tar.~|~translationMissing
Yup, that's a problem!~|~translationMissing
The player walks toward the exit, and becomes stuck in the middle of the room.~|~translationMissing
Oh good. Now I'm stuck!~|~translationMissing
The gas jets in the room begin ejecting toxic gas.~|~translationMissing
Gas as well? Wonderful!~|~translationMissing
Feeling dizzy... I can't think straight...~|~translationMissing
This is it. This is the end.~|~translationMissing
Help! Someone, help me! I'm dying...~|~translationMissing
What are you doing, stupid human?~|~translationMissing
Are you Death? You remind me a lot of a gnome I knew when I was alive.~|~translationMissing
You're not dead yet, fool! Snap out of it!~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere appears in front of the player.~|~translationMissing
Pull yourself together! We haven't got much time.~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere looks toward his hand at a special seed pod.~|~translationMissing
I was saving this for a special occasion. I suppose saving your hide counts.~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere uses the seed pod and a large aura surrounds the player and him.~|~translationMissing
Wow, that's some trick!~|~translationMissing
Hazelmere looks toward his hand at the seed pod, seeing it wilt.~|~translationMissing
Megal!~|~translationMissing
It seems I have made my choice. So be it.~|~translationMissing
Nothing you need to worry about now. We need to get out of here.~|~translationMissing
The player and Hazelmere teleport out, arriving at his house.~|~translationMissing
Phew, that was a close one! Thanks for saving me.~|~translationMissing
Consider it a thank you for helping that spirit tree. You have shown a great empathy towards the Anima Mundi. Despite being a human, perhaps you could one day be a true spirit tree mage.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... you're properly talking to me, without using a mind meld. I thought you only spoke ancient gnomish?~|~translationMissing
Bah! I've always been able to speak your uncivilised tongue.~|~translationMissing
Normally I wouldn't lower myself to these rudimentary words, but given your recent near-death experience, I felt you would not have the energy for a mind meld.~|~translationMissing
That's unusually kind for you. Not going soft, are you?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps, but it seems I would be wise to ensure your safety. The future is not a place for old wizards like me.~|~translationMissing
My autumn is ending, and only winter remains. Soon, it will fall to individuals like you to protect the Anima Mundi.~|~translationMissing
The Anima Mundi granted me a glimpse into the future. I had one final choice to make, and I made it by saving you. We now walk a path that we cannot stray from, so listen closely...~|~translationMissing
Skilled brothers, numbering eight, will assemble to fight the Mahjarrat deceiver, and they be will[sic] heading northwards to confront him.~|~translationMissing
The time after this is... clouded to me, but I see you clearly, dressed in the evil garb of night, lightly decorated with ochre like burnished gold, and the rust colours of autumn leaves.~|~translationMissing
Though you dress in the colours of evil, you will not follow that path. You will remain true to Guthix.~|~translationMissing
Of the eight, only two shall return. One represents the path of the slayer and one the path of the warrior.~|~translationMissing
Things might have been different, but I have made my choice, and it is up to you to prove that I made the right one.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like you have been having some bad dreams, or you've been reading some terrible stories.~|~translationMissing
Dreams often reveal truths masked by the light of day, but I know the truth of what I have seen in my bones. I have seen my end.~|~translationMissing
But you can't die! You're a mighty wizard!~|~translationMissing
All I know is what the trees tell me. It will soon be time for me to pass the guardianship of the spirit trees to someone else. Maybe that person is you.~|~translationMissing
Guardianship of the spirit trees? I wouldn't even know where to begin with that!~|~translationMissing
I have faith that you will learn what you need. Anyway, enough moping about the future. You should be on your way.~|~translationMissing
But what about Glouphrie?~|~translationMissing
Considering you nearly died trying to find him, I suggest you leave that problem for another day. Preferably after a better way has been found into Arposandra.~|~translationMissing
Now, I'm sure you have more important matters to attend to than chatting to a cranky old gnome. Take these and be on your way.~|~translationMissing

6.2 Returning to Lady Piscarilius~|~translationMissing
Greetings. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I'm conducting important business here for the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I suppose I could use some assistance. However, you're not really the person I need for this task.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I suppose I could use some assistance. I'm here to investigate some unusual happenings in Port Piscarilius.~|~translationMissing
What are you investigating?~|~translationMissing
What's the Kourend Council?~|~translationMissing
Although it's called a kingdom, Great Kourend hasn't actually had a king for many years. These days Kourend is a republic and it is ruled by the Kourend Council.~|~translationMissing
The Kourend Council consists of four councillors who are elected by the people every four years. One of the councillors holds the position of head councillor and this rotates every year.~|~translationMissing
Well good luck with that.~|~translationMissing
Well there is something I could use some help with. However, you're not really the person I need for this task.~|~translationMissing
Well there is something I could use some help with. I'm here to investigate some unusual happenings in Port Piscarilius.~|~translationMissing
Port Piscarilius is home to various gangs. They're a nuisance, but up until now we haven't had much trouble in dealing with them.~|~translationMissing
So what's the problem?~|~translationMissing
A new gang calling themselves the Saviours of Kourend has recently formed. That's not surprising as gangs come and go all of the time, but this one is different.~|~translationMissing
The Saviours of Kourend have been absorbing many of the other gangs. Within a few weeks, they've already become the largest gang in Kourend and more join them each day.~|~translationMissing
The talk amongst the people is that it's all down to their leader, a mysterious figure known only as the Queen of Thieves.~|~translationMissing
Nice name. Why doesn't the ruler of Port Piscarilius do something about this?~|~translationMissing
Shauna Piscarilius is the ruler of Port Piscarilius, but she spends most of her time galavanting around in that boat of hers rather than looking after her home.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. So what do you need me for?~|~translationMissing
Well my original plan was to infiltrate the gang to get close to the queen and capture her. However, I've been unable to make any progress. Apparently, I don't look the part.~|~translationMissing
Yeah not sure what that's all about. You clearly fit right in here.~|~translationMissing
Quite right. They're quite insistent though, so someone else will need to give it a go. You look like you might be just the type they're after.~|~translationMissing
That you look poor.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, if you're up for the task you'll need to infiltrate the Saviours of Kourend, find the Queen of Thieves, apprehend her and then bring her to me.~|~translationMissing
So, do you think you can do it?~|~translationMissing
Start The Queen of Thieves quest?~|~translationMissing
Excellent. The Saviours of Kourend must have their headquarters somewhere nearby. You should ask around town and see if anyone knows where they are. Good luck.~|~translationMissing
Nah.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. I'll be here if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Very well. Until next time.~|~translationMissing
Hey there. I'm looking for the Saviours of Kourend. Do you know where I can find them?~|~translationMissing
Poor looking man/woman~|~translationMissing
Keep your voice down! You've no idea who might be listening!~|~translationMissing
Oh sorry. Do you know where I can find them though?~|~translationMissing
No I don't! I keep my distance from that lot!~|~translationMissing
However, word on the streets is that Robert O'Reilly has been working with them. Perhaps he could help you. He lives in the middle of town.~|~translationMissing
Great. Thanks for the help.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Robert O'Reilly?~|~translationMissing
He'll probably be at his home. You'll find it in the middle of town.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'm looking for the Saviours of Kourend and I was hoping you could help me.~|~translationMissing
Robert O'Reilly~|~translationMissing
Yeah I can help you, but not for free.~|~translationMissing
What's your price?~|~translationMissing
It's been too long since I've eaten some proper food. All we get around here is fish. Bring me a nice stew and I'll help you out.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't already have stew in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Where am I going to get some stew?~|~translationMissing
Buy some? Cook some? Doesn't matter to me.~|~translationMissing
Very well. I'll return when I have some stew.~|~translationMissing
If the player already have stew in their inventory~|~translationMissing
It just so happens I have some stew right here.~|~translationMissing
Well that's suspiciously convenient.~|~translationMissing
I know right, what are the chances?~|~translationMissing
You give Robert O'Reilly some stew.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. The Saviours of Kourend make their home in a place called the Warrens. You'll find it in the sewers beneath us.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for your help. I'll be on my way.~|~translationMissing
No information for you then. Come back if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Do you have my stew yet?~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have stew in their inventory~|~translationMissing
No stew, no information. Come back when you have some.~|~translationMissing
If the player has stew in their inventory~|~translationMissing
How goes things?~|~translationMissing
I haven't found the Saviours of Kourend yet.~|~translationMissing
Well you should look in the sewers beneath us. There you'll find the Warrens, where the Saviours make their home.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I'm looking for the Saviours of Kourend. Do you know where I could find them?~|~translationMissing
Devan Rutter~|~translationMissing
Right here is where you'll find them. What business do you have with the Saviours?~|~translationMissing
I was hoping I could join the gang.~|~translationMissing
Join the gang? Do you think this is a game?~|~translationMissing
We don't just let anyone join our gang. If you want in, you'll need to prove your worth.~|~translationMissing
And how can I do that?~|~translationMissing
Since our formation, many of the other gangs in Kourend have joined our cause. However, some still choose to resist.~|~translationMissing
Our largest rivals are the Vipers and our leader...~|~translationMissing
The Queen of Thieves?~|~translationMissing
Let me finish!~|~translationMissing
Our leader has had enough of the Vipers and wants to make an example of them.~|~translationMissing
We need to send a message to the Vipers to let them know that their days are done.~|~translationMissing
We'd like you to kill Conrad King, one of their senior members. The man has been a thorn in our side for far too long. Besides, his murderous ways make us look like paragons of virtue in comparison.~|~translationMissing
You want me to kill someone?~|~translationMissing
As in, kill them, kill them?~|~translationMissing
So like, kill them dead?~|~translationMissing
Is this going to be a problem?~|~translationMissing
Nope, sounds good to me.~|~translationMissing
Good. You'll find Conrad King south of the Piscarilius Foodhall. News travels fast around here so we'll know when the deed is done.~|~translationMissing
Great. I'll be back soon.~|~translationMissing
Conrad King is still alive so I don't know what you're doing here. Go get the job done. He can be found south of the Piscarilius Foodhall.~|~translationMissing
How would you like to kill him?~|~translationMissing
Brutally~|~translationMissing
You brutally murder Conrad King. You monster.~|~translationMissing
Conrad King~|~translationMissing
I'm coming Elizabeth!~|~translationMissing
Softly~|~translationMissing
You realise that you can't really kill someone softly. You brutally murdered him instead.~|~translationMissing
Word on the streets is that Conrad King has met his maker. The queen is impressed. You should head on in and speak to her.~|~translationMissing
So can I go in now?~|~translationMissing
Yes! Now get out of my sight!~|~translationMissing
The Queen of Thieves~|~translationMissing
So you're the one who killed Conrad King. Not bad, but you don't look like much to me.~|~translationMissing
You'd be surprised.~|~translationMissing
No I wouldn't. I've seen hundreds of fools like you and you're all the same. I doubt you'll be sticking around here very long.~|~translationMissing
And neither will you. On behalf of the Kourend Council, I'm bringing you in.~|~translationMissing
Wow.~|~translationMissing
You truly are a complete and utter idiot.~|~translationMissing
Allow me to enlighten you. While you may have been told that the Saviours of Kourend are evil, the truth is quite the opposite. Before we came along, Kourend was filled with violent gangs who cared little for their victims.~|~translationMissing
Let me guess, you're different.~|~translationMissing
Shut up and let me speak!~|~translationMissing
Yes the Saviours of Kourend are thieves, the Saviours of Kourend are murderers. However, we do not randomly pick our targets. Everything we do has a purpose.~|~translationMissing
The name isn't a joke. We're here to save Kourend. To save it from the corruption that has tainted this once great kingdom.~|~translationMissing
We do that by taking from those who would lord themselves over the people. We remove their power and give it back to those who keep this kingdom alive.~|~translationMissing
Yet you call yourself a queen. Bit ironic don't you think?~|~translationMissing
The irony isn't lost on me. In truth I didn't want to lead at all, but it fell to me because I'm the best at it. Being born a Piscarilius means that you have to be.~|~translationMissing
Hang on... you're part of the Piscarilius family?~|~translationMissing
I am the Piscarilius family. Of course Lady Shauna Piscarilius couldn't well take charge of a gang, so I took on a different name, one that the rich and degenerate are already starting to fear.~|~translationMissing
Okay, you've got my attention. But how do I know you're telling the truth?~|~translationMissing
You are clearly fairly new to Kourend, so you might not be fully aware of our current leadership situation. After the last King died, rulership should have passed on to his daughter. However, she was declared mad.~|~translationMissing
It was the King's closest advisors that made this declaration. They took over and became the Kourend Council. They've ruled the kingdom ever since.~|~translationMissing
Now, the councillors are supposedly voted for by the people. However, the seats have been held by the same four people since the start. Pretty suspicious don't you think?~|~translationMissing
That does sound odd.~|~translationMissing
Exactly. The Council is clearly corrupt, and we intend to bring that to light. Councillor Hughes is our first target. We have reason to believe that she may be in league with the Disciples of Yama.~|~translationMissing
Disciples of Yama?~|~translationMissing
A cult of Zamorakians who supposedly serve a demon called Yama.~|~translationMissing
They've been a problem for a while, but they haven't been deemed dangerous enough to be properly dealt with. Councillor Hughes' influence, no doubt.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, go to her home and find proof of her corruption. If you find it, you will know I'm telling the truth. If you don't... well don't pretend you care about breaking and entering anyway.~|~translationMissing
Fine, I'll give you benefit of the doubt. But if you're wrong, I'm coming straight back here to apprehend you.~|~translationMissing
I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Councillor Hughes' home is on the northern side of Kingstown. Even a fool like you should be able to find it. Don't worry, she's never in.~|~translationMissing
Once you have the evidence, give it to that Lawry fellow. Provided he's not as useless as you, he'll make sure that she's dealt with.~|~translationMissing
Now get lost.~|~translationMissing
Oh it's you. Are you going to actually let me finish what I'm saying this time or are you just going to walk off again.~|~translationMissing
I'll let you finish this time.~|~translationMissing
Good. In future you should try not to be so rude.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, you are clearly fairly new to Kourend, so you might not be fully aware of our current leadership situation. After the last King died, rulership should have passed on to his daughter. However, she was declared~|~translationMissing
mad.~|~translationMissing
Whatever you want I don't care. Come back to me when you've completed your task.~|~translationMissing
Very well. How goes things?~|~translationMissing
I haven't had any luck finding the Queen of Thieves. However, I've come across this letter which you might find interesting.~|~translationMissing
Tomas takes the letter.~|~translationMissing
Blimey! Forget the Queen of Thieves. If this letter is to be believed, Councillor Hughes is working with those vile Disciples of Yama. I must report this to the Council immediately.~|~translationMissing
Great! So can I have a reward?~|~translationMissing
You've done a great service to the people of Kourend. As I'm sure you know, there is no greater reward than the satisfaction of a job well done.~|~translationMissing
Now be on your way. I have a lot of work to do.~|~translationMissing
What do you know of the Disciples of Yama?~|~translationMissing
They're a group of deranged cultists that worship some sort of demon. They're not a big threat compared to the lizardmen, but they're still an enemy to Kourend.~|~translationMissing
And Councillor Hughes is helping them? That's not good.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. I must report this to the Council immediately.~|~translationMissing
So can I have a reward?~|~translationMissing
I hear Councillor Hughes has been arrested. Perhaps you're not totally useless after all.~|~translationMissing
You know, you're really not a nice person.~|~translationMissing
Oh give me a break. You think I care what you think?~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I guess this is the part where you expect a reward?~|~translationMissing
Well I wouldn't complain.~|~translationMissing
Fine. As much as I hate to admit it, you've done alright. The arrest of Councillor Hughes can only mean good things for Kourend and her people.~|~translationMissing
This is only the beginning though. There's much work to still be done. I may well call on your help again. Or maybe I won't, who knows. Now take these and go.~|~translationMissing

Father Aereck~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the church of holy Saradomin.~|~translationMissing
Who's Saradomin?~|~translationMissing
Surely you have heard of the god, Saradomin?~|~translationMissing
He who creates the forces of goodness and purity in this world? I cannot believe your ignorance!~|~translationMissing
This is the god with more followers than any other! ...At least in this part of the world.~|~translationMissing
He who created this world along with his brothers Guthix and Zamorak?~|~translationMissing
Oh, THAT Saradomin...~|~translationMissing
There... is only one Saradomin...~|~translationMissing
Yeah... I, uh, thought you said something else.~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry. I'm not from this world.~|~translationMissing
That's... strange.~|~translationMissing
I thought things not from this world were all... You know. Slime and tentacles.~|~translationMissing
You don't understand. This is an online game!~|~translationMissing
I... beg your pardon?~|~translationMissing
I am - do you like my disguise?~|~translationMissing
Aargh! Avaunt foul creature from another dimension! Avaunt! Begone in the name of Saradomin!~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok, I was only joking...~|~translationMissing
Nice place you've got here.~|~translationMissing
It is, isn't it? It was built over 230 years ago.~|~translationMissing
That's lucky, I need someone to do a quest for me.~|~translationMissing
Start The Restless Ghost quest?~|~translationMissing
Ok, let me help then.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. The problem is, there is a ghost in the church graveyard. I would like you to get rid of it.~|~translationMissing
I believe he is currently living as a hermit in Lumbridge swamp. He has a little shack in the south-west of the swamps.~|~translationMissing
My name is Father Aereck by the way. Pleased to meet you.~|~translationMissing
Likewise.~|~translationMissing
Take care travelling through the swamps, I have heard they can be quite dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't have time right now.~|~translationMissing
Oh well. If you do have some spare time on your hands, come back and talk to me.~|~translationMissing
Have you got rid of the ghost yet?~|~translationMissing
I can't find Father Urhney at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Well, you can get to the swamp he lives in by going south through the cemetery. You'll have to go right into the far western depths of the swamp, near the coastline. That is where his house is.~|~translationMissing
Father Urhney~|~translationMissing
Go away! I'm meditating!~|~translationMissing
Well, that's friendly.~|~translationMissing
I SAID go AWAY.~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay... sheesh, what a grouch.~|~translationMissing
Father Aereck sent me to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I'd better talk to you then. What problems has he got himself into this time?~|~translationMissing
He's got a ghost haunting his graveyard.~|~translationMissing
Oh, the silly fool.~|~translationMissing
I leave town for just five months, and ALREADY he can't manage.~|~translationMissing
Father Urhney hands you an amulet.~|~translationMissing
It is an Amulet of Ghostspeak.~|~translationMissing
So called, because when you wear it you can speak to ghosts. A lot of ghosts are doomed to be ghosts because they have left some important task uncompleted.~|~translationMissing
Maybe if you know what this task is, you can get rid of the ghost. I'm not making any guarantees mind you, but it is the best I can do right now.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. I'll give it a try!~|~translationMissing
You mean he gets himself into lots of problems?~|~translationMissing
Yeah. For example, when we were trainee priests he kept on getting stuck up bell ropes. Anyway. I don't have time for chitchat. What's his problem THIS time?~|~translationMissing
I've come to repossess your house.~|~translationMissing
Under what grounds???~|~translationMissing
Repeated failure on mortgage repayments.~|~translationMissing
What? But... I don't have a mortgage! I built this house myself!~|~translationMissing
Sorry. I must have got the wrong address. All the houses look the same around here.~|~translationMissing
What? What houses? What ARE you talking about?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I just wanted this house...~|~translationMissing
Oh.. go away and stop wasting my time!~|~translationMissing
I had a talk with Father Urhney. He has given me this funny amulet to talk to the ghost with.~|~translationMissing
I always wondered what that amulet was... Well, I hope it's useful. Tell me when you get rid of the ghost!~|~translationMissing
I've lost the Amulet of Ghostspeak.~|~translationMissing
If they player currently has it in their inventory~|~translationMissing
What are you talking about? I can see you've got it with you!~|~translationMissing
If the amulet if stored in a bank, Death's Office, Item Retrieval Service~|~translationMissing
You come here wasting my time... Has it even occurred to you that you've got it stored somewhere? Now GO AWAY!~|~translationMissing
Father Urhney signs.~|~translationMissing
How careless can you get? Those things aren't easy to come by you know! Now clear some space in your inventory and I'll give you another one.~|~translationMissing
How careless can you get? Those things aren't easy to come by you know! It's a good job I've got a spare.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives ghostspeak amulet.)~|~translationMissing
Be more careful this time.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll try to be.~|~translationMissing
Hello ghost, how are you?~|~translationMissing
Restless ghost~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't speak ghost.~|~translationMissing
Woo woo?~|~translationMissing
Nope, still don't understand you.~|~translationMissing
WOOOOOOOOO!~|~translationMissing
Ooh, THAT'S interesting.~|~translationMissing
Woo wooo. Woooooooooooooooooo!~|~translationMissing
Did he really?~|~translationMissing
Woo.~|~translationMissing
My brother had EXACTLY the same problem.~|~translationMissing
Woo Wooooo! Wooooo Woo woo woo!~|~translationMissing
You'll have to give me the recipe some time...~|~translationMissing
Wooooooo woo woooooooo.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.~|~translationMissing
Wooo woo?~|~translationMissing
Well, if you INSIST.~|~translationMissing
Wooooooooo!~|~translationMissing
Ah well, better be off now...~|~translationMissing
Goodbye. Thanks for the chat.~|~translationMissing
Wooo wooo?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, that's what I thought.~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Missing dialogue, some potentially jumbled in with above options. edit)~|~translationMissing
Any hints where I can find some treasure?~|~translationMissing
Wooooooo woo! Wooooo woo wooooo woowoowoowoo~|~translationMissing
Woo wooo. Wooooo woo woo? Woooooooooooooooooo!~|~translationMissing
Thank you. You've been very helpful.~|~translationMissing
Wooooooo.~|~translationMissing
Not very good actually.~|~translationMissing
What's the problem then?~|~translationMissing
Did you just understand what I said???~|~translationMissing
Yep, now tell me what the problem is.~|~translationMissing
WOW! This is INCREDIBLE! I didn't expect anyone to ever understand me again!~|~translationMissing
Ok, Ok, I can understand you!~|~translationMissing
Well, to be honest... I'm not sure.~|~translationMissing
I've been told a certain task may need to be completed so you can rest in peace.~|~translationMissing
I should think it is probably because a warlock has come along and stolen my skull. If you look inside my coffin there, you'll find my corpse without a head on it.~|~translationMissing
Do you know where this warlock might be now?~|~translationMissing
I think it was one of the warlocks who lives in the big tower by the sea south-west from here.~|~translationMissing
Ok. I will try and get the skull back for you, then you can rest in peace.~|~translationMissing
Ooh, thank you. That would be such a great relief! It is so dull being a ghost...~|~translationMissing
No, you sound like you're speaking nonsense to me.~|~translationMissing
Oh that's a pity. You got my hopes up there.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, it is a pity. Sorry about that.~|~translationMissing
Hang on a second... you CAN understand me!~|~translationMissing
No I can't.~|~translationMissing
Great. The first person I can speak to in ages...and they're a moron.~|~translationMissing
Yep, clever aren't I?~|~translationMissing
I'm impressed. You must be very powerful. I don't suppose you can stop me being a ghost?~|~translationMissing
Yes, ok. Do you know WHY you're a ghost?~|~translationMissing
Nope. I just know I can't do much of anything like this!~|~translationMissing
No, you're scary!~|~translationMissing
Great. The first person I can speak to in ages...and they're an idiot.~|~translationMissing
Wow, this amulet works!~|~translationMissing
Oh! It's your amulet that's doing it! I did wonder. I don't suppose you can help me? I don't like being a ghost.~|~translationMissing
Yes, ok. Do you know why you're a ghost?~|~translationMissing
How are you doing finding my skull?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I can't find it at the moment.~|~translationMissing
Ah well. Keep on looking. I'm pretty sure it's somewhere in the tower south-west from here. There's a lot of levels to the tower, though. I suppose it might take a little while to find.~|~translationMissing
I've found out that the ghost's corpse has lost its skull. If I can find the skull, the ghost should leave.~|~translationMissing
That WOULD explain it. Hmmmmm. Well, I haven't seen any skulls.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think a warlock has stolen it.~|~translationMissing
I hate warlocks. Ah well, good luck!~|~translationMissing
I've finally found the ghost's skull!~|~translationMissing
Great! Put it in the ghost's coffin and see what happens!~|~translationMissing
It's the skull of the ghost that is haunting Lumbridge graveyard. Maybe I should return this back to the ghost's coffin.~|~translationMissing
I have found it!~|~translationMissing
Hurrah! Now I can stop being a ghost! You just need to put it in my coffin there, then I'll be free!~|~translationMissing
I can't give it to him. It goes right through him.~|~translationMissing
If you just put it in my coffin that should do the trick...~|~translationMissing
Release! Thank you stranger...~|~translationMissing

Boo hoo! Oh dear, my only daughter....~|~translationMissing
What's the matter?~|~translationMissing
Oh dear... my daughter, Ana, has gone missing in the desert. I fear that she is lost, or perhaps... *sob* even worse.~|~translationMissing
When did she go into the desert?~|~translationMissing
*Sob* she went in there just a few days ago, *Sob* she said she would be back yesterday.~|~translationMissing
*Sob* And she's not...~|~translationMissing
Start The Tourist Trap quest?~|~translationMissing
I'll find her for you!~|~translationMissing
Oh thank you! You've made me a very happy mother, I just hope it's not too late!~|~translationMissing
Do you have any ideas on where she may have gone?~|~translationMissing
I did go looking for her myself and I came across some footprints just a little way south. I'm worried that they lead to the desert mining camp!~|~translationMissing
Oh... Well I hope you find her.~|~translationMissing
Cheer up, it might never happen.~|~translationMissing
It may already have happened you thoughtless oaf! My daughter, Ana, has gone missing in the desert. I fear that she is lost, or perhaps... *sobs* even worse.~|~translationMissing
Please bring my daughter back to me. She is most likely list in the Desert somewhere. I miss her so much... Wahhhhh! *Sob*~|~translationMissing
Do you know where Ana went?~|~translationMissing
I did look for her myself and a little way south. I came across some footprints which may be hers. I'm worried that she may have been caught by some guards and taken to work in that terrible desert mine to the south.~|~translationMissing
Is there anywhere around here that she would go?~|~translationMissing
I think she may have just gone a little way into the desert. It's unlike her to go too far away. She is an adventurous girl, but she knows how I worry. She wouldn't go too far.~|~translationMissing
Where do you think I should start my search?~|~translationMissing
I think I saw some of her footprints to the south, you could start there. Hopefully she'll just be over a few sand dunes, but you never know. She may have been taken to that awful desert mining camp or captured by~|~translationMissing
brigands!~|~translationMissing
This looks like some disturbed sand. Footsteps seem to be heading off towards the South.~|~translationMissing
You search the footsteps more closely. You can see that there are five sets of footprints. One set of footprints seems lighter than the others. The four other footsteps were made by heavier people with boots.~|~translationMissing
You remember that Irena mentioned something about Ana wearing a red scarf before she left for the desert.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, what do you want?~|~translationMissing
It's none of your business now get lost.~|~translationMissing

Don't try to fool me, you don't have five gold coins! Before you try to bribe someone, make sure you have the money effendi!~|~translationMissing
Guards!! Guards!~|~translationMissing
Let's see how good you are with Desert Survival techniques.~|~translationMissing
You're bundled into the back of a cart and blindfolded...~|~translationMissing
Sometime later you wake up in the desert.~|~translationMissing
If the player has any filled waterskins~|~translationMissing
You won't be needing that water anymore!~|~translationMissing
The guards move off leaving you stranded in the desert.~|~translationMissing
Well, it certainly will help... -- The guard takes the five gold coins. -- Now then, what did you want to know?~|~translationMissing
It's just a mining camp. Prisoners are sent here from Al-Kharid. They serve out their sentence by mining. Most prisoners will end their days here, surrounded by desert.~|~translationMissing
So you could almost say that they got their ... 'Just Desserts'~|~translationMissing
You could say that... -- There is an awkward pause --~|~translationMissing
But it wouldn't be very funny.~|~translationMissing
When they talk about 'the silence of the desert', this must be what they mean.~|~translationMissing
Can I take a look around the place?~|~translationMissing
Not really. The Captain won't let you in the compound. He's the only one who has the key to the gate. And if you talk to him, he'll probably just order us to kill you. Unless...~|~translationMissing
Does the Captain order you to kill a lot of people?~|~translationMissing
Unless what?~|~translationMissing
Unless he has a use for you. He's been trying to track down someone called 'Al Zaba Bhasim'. You could offer to catch him and that might put you in his good books?~|~translationMissing
Where would I find this Al Zaba Bhasim?~|~translationMissing
Well, he could be anywhere. He's a nomadic desert dweller. However, they say that he's frequently to be found to the west in the hospitality of the tenti's.~|~translationMissing
The Tenti's, who are they?~|~translationMissing
Well, we're not really sure what their proper name is. But they live in tents so we call them the 'Tenti's'.~|~translationMissing
Is Al Zaba Bhasim very tough?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm not sure, but by all accounts, he is a slippery fellow. The Captain has been trying to capture him for years. A bit of a waste of time if you ask me. Anyway, I have to get going, I do have work to do.~|~translationMissing
What are you guarding?~|~translationMissing
Well, if you have to know, we're making sure that no prisoners get out. -- The guard gives you a disapproving look. -- And to make sure that unauthorised people don't get in.~|~translationMissing
-- The guard looks around nervously. -- You'd better go soon before the Captain orders us to kill you.~|~translationMissing
-- The guard snorts. -- *Snort* Just about anyone who talks to him.~|~translationMissing
Unless he has a use for you, he'll probably just order us to kill you. And it's such a horrible job cleaning up the mess afterwards.~|~translationMissing
Not to mention the senseless waste of human life.~|~translationMissing
Huh? Them's your words, not mine.~|~translationMissing
It doesn't sound as if you respect your Captain much.~|~translationMissing
-- The guard looks around conspiratorially. --~|~translationMissing
Well, to be honest. We think he's not exactly as brave as he makes out. But we have to follow his orders. If someone called him a coward, or managed to trick him into a one-on-one duel many of us bet that he'd be~|~translationMissing
beaten.~|~translationMissing
And how could I trick him into a one-on-one duel?~|~translationMissing
Like all cowards, he likes to be made to feel important. If anyone insults him outright, he just gets us to do his dirty work. However, if he thinks he's better than you, if you compliment him, he may feel that he can defeat~|~translationMissing
you. And if he initiated a duel, all the men agreed that they wouldn't intervene. We think he'd be slaughtered in double quick time.~|~translationMissing
Can I have a bet on that?~|~translationMissing
If the player already placed a bet~|~translationMissing
Sorry, we've already taken your bet, wouldn't want any cheating now. Anyway, I have to get back to work. See ya around...~|~translationMissing
Well, if you think you stand a chance, sure. But remember, if he gives us an order, we have to obey.~|~translationMissing
I'll bet 5 gold that I win.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have enough gold~|~translationMissing
Huh! It looks like you're betting with money you don't have.~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll take that bet.~|~translationMissing
You hand over 5 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
Ok, if you win, you'll get 6 gold back. Anyway, I have to get going, I do have work to do. -- The guard walks off. --~|~translationMissing
I'll bet 10 gold that I win.~|~translationMissing
You hand over 10 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
Ok, if you win, you'll get 12 gold back. Anyway, I have to get going, I do have work to do. -- The guard walks off. --~|~translationMissing
I'll bet 15 gold that I win.~|~translationMissing
You hand over 15 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
Ok, if you win, you'll get 19 gold back. Anyway, I have to get going, I do have work to do. -- The guard walks off. --~|~translationMissing
I'll bet 20 gold that I win.~|~translationMissing
You hand over 20 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
Ok, if you win, you'll get 30 gold back. Anyway, I have to get going, I do have work to do. -- The guard walks off. --~|~translationMissing
Yeah, whatever!~|~translationMissing
Get lost before I chop off your head!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps these five gold coins will sweeten your mood?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps five gold coins will sweeten your mood?~|~translationMissing
Well, it certainly will help!~|~translationMissing
-- The guard takes the five gold coins. --~|~translationMissing
Now then, what did you want to know?~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for a woman called Ana, have you seen her?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well, we get a lot of people in here. But not many women though... Saw one come in last week....~|~translationMissing
But I don't know if it's the woman you're looking for?~|~translationMissing
No, now get lost!~|~translationMissing
Perhaps five gold coins will help you remember?~|~translationMissing
You watch the Mercenary Captain for some time. He has a large metal key attached to his belt. You notice that he usually gets his men to do his dirty work.~|~translationMissing
This gate needs a key in order to be opened.~|~translationMissing
You see what looks like a mining compound. There seems to be people mining rocks. They look as if they're chained to the rocks and they're being watched over by the guards. It's not a very happy place.~|~translationMissing
You notice that people are thoroughly searched as they enter and leave the compound and people wielding weapons or wearing armour are treated quite severly.~|~translationMissing
This mercenary looks very fierce. Are you sure you want to attack him?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I can take him on!~|~translationMissing
(The player is hit 4 times before they are transported into the desert.)~|~translationMissing
Er, no thanks, I've had second thoughts about it.~|~translationMissing
You decide not to fight the Mercenary.~|~translationMissing
This mercenary Captain looks very fierce. Are you sure you want to attack him?~|~translationMissing
Mercenary Captain~|~translationMissing
Destroy this low life desert rat guards!~|~translationMissing
Guards! Attack that Desert Jackal!~|~translationMissing
Kill that intruder guards!~|~translationMissing
Men! Kill this filthy vermin.~|~translationMissing
Kill this madman guards!~|~translationMissing
(A guard attacks you 4 times before you're transported into the desert.)~|~translationMissing
You decide not to fight the Mercenary Captain.~|~translationMissing
You approach the Mercenary Captain.~|~translationMissing
Wow! A real captain!~|~translationMissing
Be off effendi, you are not wanted around here.~|~translationMissing
That's rude, I ought to teach you some manners.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes! How might you do that? You seem little more than a gutter dweller. How could you teach me manners?~|~translationMissing
With my right fist and a good deal of force.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, ready your weapon then! I'm sure you won't mind if my men join in? Har, har, har! Guards kill this gutter dwelling slime.~|~translationMissing
(Continues with Guards eviction dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
Err, sorry. I thought I was talking to someone else.~|~translationMissing
Well, Effendi, you do need to be careful of what you say to people. Or they may take it the wrong way. Thankfully, I'm very understanding. I'll just let my guards deal with you.~|~translationMissing
Guards, teach this desert weed some manners.~|~translationMissing
I'd love to work for a tough guy like you!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, oh yes, what can you do?~|~translationMissing
I can mine!~|~translationMissing
Ha, ha, ha! You come to a mining camp and offer us your mining skills! Thanks effendi, but we have all the miners we'll ever need.~|~translationMissing
Now be off with you, before we reduce you to a bloody mess on the sand.~|~translationMissing
Can't I do something for a strong Captain like you?~|~translationMissing
You don't scare me!~|~translationMissing
The Captain ponders a moment and then looks at your critically.~|~translationMissing
You could bring me the head of Al Zaba Bhasim.~|~translationMissing
He is the leader of the notorius desert bandits, they plague us daily. You should find them west of here. You should have no problem in finishing them all of. Do this for me and maybe I will consider helping you.~|~translationMissing
Good... run along then. You stand around flapping your tongue chatting like an insane camel.~|~translationMissing
Sorry Sir, I don't think I can do that.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well yes. I did consider you might not be right for the job. Be off with you then before I turn my men loose on you.~|~translationMissing
It's a funny captain who can't fight his own battles!~|~translationMissing
The men around you fall silent and the Captain silently fumes. All eyes turn to the Captain...~|~translationMissing
Very well, if you're challenging me, let's get on with it!~|~translationMissing
The guards gather around to watch the fight.~|~translationMissing
(The Mercenary Captain attacks.)~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll be moving along then.~|~translationMissing
Effendi, I think you'll find that is the wisest decision you have made today.~|~translationMissing
How dare you talk to me like that! Explain your business quickly... or my guards will slay you where you stand.~|~translationMissing
Some guards close in around you.~|~translationMissing
I'm lost, can you help me?~|~translationMissing
The captain smiles broadly and with a sickening voice says...~|~translationMissing
We are not a charity effendi. Be off with you before I have your head removed from your body.~|~translationMissing
Well, perhaps I can try a little harder. Guards, kill this infidel.~|~translationMissing
Effendi...~|~translationMissing
For just one second, imagine that it's none of your business!~|~translationMissing
Also imagine having your limbs pulled from your body one at a time.~|~translationMissing
Now, what was the question again?~|~translationMissing
Do you have sand in your ears? I said. 'What are you guarding?'~|~translationMissing
Why... you ignorant, rude and eternally damned infidel,  Guards, kill this infidel!~|~translationMissing
Hey ugly!~|~translationMissing
I will not tolerate such insults.. Guards, kill [him/her].~|~translationMissing
The captain marches away in disgust leaving his guards to tackle you~|~translationMissing
If this is the first time being evicted by the guards~|~translationMissing
Prepare to die effendi!~|~translationMissing
A guard approaches you and pretends to start hitting you.~|~translationMissing
Take that you infidel!~|~translationMissing
The guard leans closer to you and says in a low voice.~|~translationMissing
We're sick of having to kill every lunatic that comes along and insults the captain, it makes such a mess. Thankfully, he's a bit decrepit so he doesn't notice so please, buzz off and don't come here again.~|~translationMissing
If this is the second time being evicted by the guards~|~translationMissing
The guard approaches you again and gives you a sharp kick.~|~translationMissing
If this is the third time being evicted by the guards~|~translationMissing
The guard leans close and whispers~|~translationMissing
Are you mad effendi? This is your last chance! Leave now and never come back or I'll introduce you to my friend.~|~translationMissing
The guard half draws his fearsome looking scimitar.~|~translationMissing
And we'll be pleased to clean the mess up after you've been dispatched.~|~translationMissing
If this is the fourth or greater time being evicted by the guards~|~translationMissing
An angry guard approaches you and whips out his sword.~|~translationMissing
Okay, that does it!~|~translationMissing
You're in serious trouble now!~|~translationMissing
Okay men, we need to teach this person a lesson~|~translationMissing
about desert survival.~|~translationMissing
The guards grab you and rough you up a bit.~|~translationMissing
You're grabbed and manhandled onto a cart.~|~translationMissing
Sometimes later you're dumped in the middle of the desert.~|~translationMissing
The guards throw your water away.~|~translationMissing
Al Shabim~|~translationMissing
Hello Effendi!~|~translationMissing
I am Al Shabim, greetings on behalf of the Bedabin nomads.~|~translationMissing
I am looking for Al Zaba Bhasim.~|~translationMissing
Huh! You have been talking to the guards at the mining camp. Or worse, that cowardly mercenary captain. Al Zaba Bhasim does not exist, he is a figment of their imagination!~|~translationMissing
Go back and tell this captain that if he wants to find this man he should search for him personally. See how much of his own time he would like to waste.~|~translationMissing
I've already explained that he doesn't exist. Now, can we move on?~|~translationMissing
I've some information for you about Al Zaba Bhasim~|~translationMissing
Oh yes and what might that be?~|~translationMissing
Al Zaba Bhasim is a figment of your diseased imagination. Go look for him yourself and waste your own time if you think he still exists.~|~translationMissing
Why, I've never been so insulted in all my days. Prepare to defend yourself wretch, I'll run you through myself!~|~translationMissing
If the player already had the key in the bank~|~translationMissing
You kill the captain!~|~translationMissing
After killing the captain, you remember that you stored a mining gate key in your bank.~|~translationMissing
The mercenary captain drops a metal key on the floor, you try to add it to your inventory, but it won't fit in. You drop the key on the floor.~|~translationMissing
The mercenary captain drops a metal key on the floor. You quickly grab the key and add it to your inventory.~|~translationMissing
Hey, I've come to collect my bet!~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess congratulations are in order.~|~translationMissing
And we'll only charge the paltry sum of... erm...~|~translationMissing
The guards starts to do some mental calculations. You can see his brow furrow and he starts to sweat profusely.~|~translationMissing
If the player bet 5 coins~|~translationMissing
Five gold for cleaning up the mess. You have won 1 Gold piece! Well done..! Ha, ha, ha ha! -- The guards walk off chuckling to themselves. --~|~translationMissing
If the player bet 10 coins~|~translationMissing
10 gold for cleaning up the mess. You have won 2 Gold pieces! Well done..! Ha, ha, ha ha! -- The guards walk off chuckling to themselves. --~|~translationMissing
If the player bet 15 coins~|~translationMissing
15 gold for cleaning up the mess. You have won 4 Gold pieces! Well done..! Ha, ha, ha ha! -- The guards walk off chuckling to themselves. --~|~translationMissing
If the player bet 20 coins~|~translationMissing
20 gold for cleaning up the mess. You have won 10 Gold pieces! Well done..! Ha, ha, ha, ha! -- The guards walk off chuckling to themselves. --~|~translationMissing
Move along now, we've had enough of your sort!~|~translationMissing
Move along now... we've had enough of your sort!~|~translationMissing
The guards search you thoroughly as you go through the gates.~|~translationMissing
Hey - you with the weapon!~|~translationMissing
You're not allowed in here!~|~translationMissing
Quick men, get her!!~|~translationMissing
Quick, men, get her!!~|~translationMissing
(Continues with Getting jailed dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
Hey, they're interesting clothes!~|~translationMissing
You're no slave.~|~translationMissing
What are you doing in here?~|~translationMissing
The guards search you!~|~translationMissing
If the metal key is in the inventory and the guards find it~|~translationMissing
The guards find the main gate key and remove it!~|~translationMissing
If the cell door key is in the inventory and the guards find it~|~translationMissing
The guards find the cell door key and remove it!~|~translationMissing
You are roughed up by the guards and manhandled into a cell.~|~translationMissing
Into the cell you go! I hope this teaches you a lesson.~|~translationMissing
The door seems to be pretty locked.~|~translationMissing
You bend the bars back.~|~translationMissing
You prepare to squeeze through the bars.~|~translationMissing
You scrape your hands and knees as you climb up.~|~translationMissing
Mine cart driver~|~translationMissing
Don't trouble me, can't you see I'm busy?~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing slave clothes~|~translationMissing
Male slave~|~translationMissing
You look like a new 'recruit'. How long have you been here?~|~translationMissing
I've just arrived.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, it looks like it as well. It's a shame that I won't be around long enough to get to know you. I'm making a break for it today. I have a plan to get out of here! It's amazing in its sophistication.~|~translationMissing
What are those big wooden doors in the corner of the compound?~|~translationMissing
They lead to an underground mine, but you really don't want to go down there.~|~translationMissing
I've only seen slaves and guards go down there, I never see the slaves come back up. At least up here you have a nice view and a bit of sun. -- The slave smiles at you and goes back to his work. --~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, that sounds interesting.~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is actually. I have all the details figured out except for one.~|~translationMissing
What's that then?~|~translationMissing
-- The slave rattles the chains on his arms loudly. -- These bracelets, I can't seem to get them off. If I could get them off, I'd be able to climb my way out of here.~|~translationMissing
I can try to undo them for you.~|~translationMissing
Really, that would be great... -- The slave looks at you strangely. -- Hang on a minute... I suppose you want something for doing this?~|~translationMissing
The last time I did a trade in this place, I nearly lost the shirt from my back!~|~translationMissing
It's funny you should say that...~|~translationMissing
It's funny you should say that actually.~|~translationMissing
-- The slave looks at you blankly. --~|~translationMissing
Yeah, go on!~|~translationMissing
If I can get the chains off, you have to give me something, okay?~|~translationMissing
Sure, what do you want?~|~translationMissing
I want your clothes!~|~translationMissing
Blimey!~|~translationMissing
I can dress like a slave and gain access to the mine area to scout it out.~|~translationMissing
You're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid. But what would I wear if you take my clothes? Get me some nice desert clothes and I'll think about it?~|~translationMissing
That sounds awful.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, bunch of no hopers, tried to rob me blind. But I guess that's what you get when you deal with convicts.~|~translationMissing
That's ridiculous, you're talking rubbish.~|~translationMissing
No, it's true, I can make a break for it If I can just get these bracelets off.~|~translationMissing
Thanks... same to you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's a shame.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's a shame...~|~translationMissing
Still, 'worse things happen at sea right?'~|~translationMissing
You've obviously never worked as a slave~|~translationMissing
...in a mining camp...~|~translationMissing
...in the middle of the desert.~|~translationMissing
Well I suppose I'd better be getting on my way now...~|~translationMissing
-- The slave nods in agreement and goes back to work. --~|~translationMissing
Oh, I've been here ages.~|~translationMissing
That's funny, I haven't seen you around here before. You're clothes look too clean for you to have been here ages.~|~translationMissing
Okay, you caught me out.~|~translationMissing
Ah ha! I knew it! A new recruit then? It's a shame that I won't be around long enough to get to know you. I'm making a break for it today.~|~translationMissing
I have a plan to get out of here! It's amazing in its sophistication.~|~translationMissing
The guards allow me to clean my clothes.~|~translationMissing
Oh, a special relationship with the guards heh? How very nice of them. Maybe you could persuade them to let me out of here?~|~translationMissing
Hello again, do you want to try and unlock my chains? I'd really appreciate it!~|~translationMissing
Unlock Prisoner's Chains?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, okay, let's give it a go.~|~translationMissing
You use some nearby bits of wood and wire to try and pick the lock.~|~translationMissing
You fail!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I'll give it another go.~|~translationMissing
I'll try something different instead.~|~translationMissing
Are you givin' in already?~|~translationMissing
I just want to try something else.~|~translationMissing
Okay, if you want to try again, let me know.~|~translationMissing
You hear a satisfying 'click' as you tumble the lock mechanism.~|~translationMissing
Great! You did it! Do you want to trade clothes now?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll trade.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the desert robe, desert shirt, and desert boots~|~translationMissing
I need a desert robe, a desert shirt and desert boots if you want these clothes off me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the desert robe and desert shirt~|~translationMissing
I need a desert robe and a desert shirt if you want these clothes off me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the desert robe and desert boots~|~translationMissing
I need a desert robe and desert boots if you want these clothes off me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the desert shirt and desert boots~|~translationMissing
I need a desert shirt and desert boots if you want these clothes off me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the desert robe~|~translationMissing
I need a desert robe if you want these clothes off me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the desert boots~|~translationMissing
I need desert boots if you want these clothes off me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the desert shirt~|~translationMissing
I need a desert shirt if you want these clothes off me.~|~translationMissing
Great! You have the Desert Clothes! -- The slave starts undressing right in front of you -- Okay, here's the clothes, I won't need them anymore.~|~translationMissing
The slave gives you his dirty, flea infested robe.~|~translationMissing
The slave gives you his muddy, sweat soaked shirt.~|~translationMissing
The slave gives you a smelly pair of decomposing boots.~|~translationMissing
Escaping slave~|~translationMissing
Right, I'm off! Good luck!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, good luck to you too!~|~translationMissing
Okay, fair enough, let me know if you change your mind though.~|~translationMissing
I need to do some other things first.~|~translationMissing
Okay, fair enough. Let me know when you want to give it another go.~|~translationMissing
Do you still want to try and undo the locks for me?~|~translationMissing
Not much to do here but mine all day long.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the Desert Clothes yet?~|~translationMissing
Oh bother, I was caught by the guards again... Listen, if you can get me some Desert Clothes, I'll trade you for my slaves clothes again.. Do you want to trade?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the slave clothes~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the slave clothes~|~translationMissing
(The escaping slave turns into the male slave and continues as above.~|~translationMissing
A nearby guard spots you!~|~translationMissing
Oh oh!~|~translationMissing
Oi, what are you two doing?~|~translationMissing
You watch the doors for some time. You notice that only slaves seem to go down there. You might be able to sneak down if you pass as a slave.~|~translationMissing
The doors open with some effort!~|~translationMissing
The guard looks as if he's been down here a while.~|~translationMissing
Er nothing really.~|~translationMissing
Okay... so move along and get on with your work.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to mine in a different area.~|~translationMissing
Oh, you want to work in another area of the mine eh? --The guard seems pleased with his rhetorical question.-- Well, I can understand that! A change is as good as a rest they say.~|~translationMissing
Huh, fat chance of a rest for me.~|~translationMissing
The guard cuffs you around head.[sic]~|~translationMissing
You miserable whelp! Get back to work!~|~translationMissing
Yes sir, you're quite right sir.~|~translationMissing
Of course I'm right. And what goes around comes around as they say. And it's been absolutely ages since I've had anything different to eat.~|~translationMissing
What I wouldn't give for some whole, fresh, ripe and juicy pineapple for a change. And those Tenti's have the best pineapple in this entire area.~|~translationMissing
The guard winks at you.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you get my meaning...~|~translationMissing
How am I going to get some pineapples around here?~|~translationMissing
Well, that's not my problem is it? Also, I know that you slaves trade your items down here. I'm sure that if you're resourceful enough, you'll come up with the goods.~|~translationMissing
Now, get along and do some work, before we're both in for it. And remember, I prefer my pineapples whole, not chopped up with all the juice gone.~|~translationMissing
Yes sir, we understand each other perfectly.~|~translationMissing
Okay, good then. And remember, I prefer my pineapples whole, not chopped up with all the juice gone.~|~translationMissing
The guard moves back to his post and winks at you knowingly.~|~translationMissing
What are the Tenti's?~|~translationMissing
Well! You don't come from around here do you? The Tenti's are the nomadic people west of here. They live in tents, so we call them the Tenti's. They have great pineapples! I'm sure you get my meaning?~|~translationMissing
I am Al Shabim, greetings on behalf of the Bedabin nomads. Now... what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I am looking for a pineapple.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, well that is interesting. Our sweet pineapples are renowned throughout the whole of Kharid?! And I'll give you one if you do me a favour?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes?~|~translationMissing
Captain Siad at the mining camp is holding some secret information. It is very important to us and we would like you to get it for us. It gives details of an interesting, yet ancient weapon.~|~translationMissing
We would gladly share this information with you. All you have to do is gain access to his private room upstairs. We have a key for the chest that contains this information. Are you interested in our deal?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm interested.~|~translationMissing
That's great Effendi!~|~translationMissing
Al Shabim gives you a key.~|~translationMissing
Here is a copy of the key that should give you access to the chest.~|~translationMissing
Bring us back the plans inside the chest, they should be sealed. All haste to you Effendi!~|~translationMissing
Very well Effendi!~|~translationMissing
You notice several books on the subject of sailing.~|~translationMissing
The captain looks up from his work as you address him.~|~translationMissing
Captain Siad~|~translationMissing
I wanted to have a chat?~|~translationMissing
You don't belong in here, get out!~|~translationMissing
But I just need two minutes of your time?~|~translationMissing
Well, okay, but very quickly. I am a very busy person you know!~|~translationMissing
Well, er... erm, I err....~|~translationMissing
Come on, spit it out! Right that's it! Guards!~|~translationMissing
Hey, you there!~|~translationMissing
You're in some serious trouble now!~|~translationMissing
Oh my, a dragon just flew straight past your window!~|~translationMissing
If Captain Siad is successfully distracted~|~translationMissing
The captain seems distracted with what you just said. The captain looks out of the window for the dragon.~|~translationMissing
Really! Where? I don't see any dragons young [man/lady]? Now, please get out of my office, I have work to do.~|~translationMissing
The Captain goes back to his work.~|~translationMissing
Prepare to die!~|~translationMissing
All the slaves have broken free!~|~translationMissing
Fire! Fire!~|~translationMissing
You seem to have a lot of books!~|~translationMissing
Yes, I do. Now please get to the point?~|~translationMissing
How long have you been interested in books?~|~translationMissing
Long enough to know when someone is stalling!~|~translationMissing
Please state your business or get out!~|~translationMissing
I could get you some books!~|~translationMissing
Oh, really!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, not interested!~|~translationMissing
(If the player has seen the sailing book~|~translationMissing
) So, you're interested in sailing?~|~translationMissing
So, you're interested in sailing?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes actually... It's been a passion of mine for some years...~|~translationMissing
I could tell by the cut of your jib.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes? Really?~|~translationMissing
-- The Captain looks flattered. --~|~translationMissing
Well, I was quite a catch in my day you know!~|~translationMissing
The Captain starts rambling on about his days as a salty sea dog. He looks quite distracted...~|~translationMissing
Not much sailing to be done around here though?~|~translationMissing
Well of course there isn't, we're surrounded by desert. Now, why are you here exactly?~|~translationMissing
What's it got to do with you?~|~translationMissing
This happens to be my office. Now explain yourself before I run you through!~|~translationMissing
(If the player has talked to Al Shabim about the plans~|~translationMissing
) I'm here to take your plans, hand them over now or I'll kill you!~|~translationMissing
I'm here to take your plans, hand them over now or I'll kill you!~|~translationMissing
Guards! Guards!~|~translationMissing
The guard downstairs said you were lonely.~|~translationMissing
Well, I most certainly am not lonely!~|~translationMissing
I'm an incredibly busy man you know! Now, get to the point, what do you want?~|~translationMissing
I need to service your chest.~|~translationMissing
You need to what?~|~translationMissing
I need to service your chest?~|~translationMissing
There's nothing wrong with the chest, it's fine, now get out!~|~translationMissing
I'll teach you a lesson!~|~translationMissing
Don't talk rubbish, the warning siren isn't sounding. Now state your business before I have you thrown out.~|~translationMissing
The captain seems distracted with what you just said. The captain looks out of the window to see if there is a fire.~|~translationMissing
Where's the fire? I don't see any fire? Stop messing me around and state your business!~|~translationMissing
It's down in the lower mines, sound the alarm!~|~translationMissing
You go and sound the alarm, I can't see anything wrong with the mine. Have you seen the fire yourself?~|~translationMissing
Yes actually!~|~translationMissing
Well, why didn't you raise the alarm?~|~translationMissing
I don't know where the alarm is.~|~translationMissing
That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard. Who are you? Where do you come from? It doesn't matter... Guards! Show this person out!~|~translationMissing
I was so concerned for your safety that I rushed to save you.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's very good of you. But as you can see, I am very fine and well thanks! Now, please leave so that I can get back to my work.~|~translationMissing
The Captain goes back to his desk.~|~translationMissing
Er, no, one of the slaves told me.~|~translationMissing
Well... you can't believe them, they're all a bunch of convicts. Anyway, it doesn't look as if there is a fire down there. So I'm going to get on with my work. Please remove yourself from my office.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, you're right, they must have put it out!~|~translationMissing
Good, now perhaps you can leave me in peace? After all I do have some work to do.~|~translationMissing
Er, yes okay then.~|~translationMissing
Good! Please remove yourself from my office.~|~translationMissing
You search the captains desk while he's not looking..~|~translationMissing
If the player already has all the keys~|~translationMissing
...but you find nothing of interest.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the cell door key~|~translationMissing
You find a cell door key.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the metal key~|~translationMissing
You find the key to the main gate.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the wrought iron key~|~translationMissing
You find the key to the main gate.[sic]~|~translationMissing
If Captain Siad is not distracted~|~translationMissing
The captain spots you before you manage to open the chest...~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the bedabin key~|~translationMissing
This chest needs a key to unlock it.~|~translationMissing
If Captain Siad is distracted~|~translationMissing
While the Captain's distracted, you quickly unlock the chest with the Bedabins' copy of the key. You take out the plans.~|~translationMissing
Aha! I see you have the plans. This is great! However, these plans do indeed look very technical. My people have further need of your skills.~|~translationMissing
If you can help us to manufacture this item, we will share its secret with you. Does this deal interest you effendi?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm very interested.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the bronze bar, feathers, and hammer~|~translationMissing
Great, we need the following items~|~translationMissing
a bar of pure bronze, 10 feathers and a hammer. Bring them to me and we'll continue to make the item.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the bronze bar and feathers~|~translationMissing
a bar of pure bronze and 10 feathers. Bring them to me and we'll continue to make the item.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the feathers and hammer~|~translationMissing
Great, I can see that you have a bar of bronze. Now we just need some feathers and a hammer before we can continue.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the bronze bar and hammer~|~translationMissing
Great, I can see that you have some feathers. Now we just need a bar of bronze and a hammer before we can continue.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the feathers~|~translationMissing
Great, I can see that you have a bar of bronze. Now we just need some feathers before we can continue.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the bronze bar~|~translationMissing
Great, I can see that you have some feathers. Now we just need a bar of bronze before we can continue.~|~translationMissing
If the player is missing the hammer~|~translationMissing
Great, I can see that you have some feathers and a bar of Bronze, but you just need a hammer now.~|~translationMissing
Great, I can see that you have some feathers, a bar of Bronze and a hammer. Are you still willing to help make the weapon?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm kind of curious.~|~translationMissing
Okay Effendi, you need to follow the plans. You will need some special tools for this... There is an anvil in the other tent. You have my permission to use it, but show the plans to the guard.~|~translationMissing
You have the plans and all the items needed. You should be able to complete the item on your own. Please bring me the item when it is finished.~|~translationMissing
As you wish Effendi!~|~translationMissing
Come back if you change your mind!~|~translationMissing
Bedabin Nomad Guard~|~translationMissing
Sorry, but you can't use the tent without permission. Orders of Al Shabim.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, this is a private tent, no one is allowed in. Orders of Al Shabim...~|~translationMissing
Al Shabim said I could enter, here are the plans!~|~translationMissing
Okay go ahead.~|~translationMissing
You walk into the tent.~|~translationMissing
You walk back out of the tent.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to follow the technical plans??~|~translationMissing
Follow the technical plans?~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'd like to try.~|~translationMissing
You begin experimenting in forging the weapon...~|~translationMissing
You follow the plans carefully, and after some careful work, you finally manage to forge a sharp, pointed... dart tip.~|~translationMissing
You study the technical plans even more... You need to attach feathers to the tip to complete the weapon.~|~translationMissing
No, not just yet.~|~translationMissing
You try to attach feathers to the bronze dart tip.~|~translationMissing
Following the plans is tricky, but you persevere.~|~translationMissing
You successfully attach the feathers to the dart tip.~|~translationMissing
You show Al Shabim the prototype dart.~|~translationMissing
This is truly fantastic Effendi!~|~translationMissing
We will take the technical plans for the weapon as well.~|~translationMissing
You hand over the technical plans for the weapon.~|~translationMissing
We are forever grateful for this gift. My advisors have discovered some secrets which we will share with you.~|~translationMissing
Al Shabim's advisors show you some advanced techniques for making the new weapon.~|~translationMissing
Please accept this selection of six bronze throwing darts as a token of our appreciation.~|~translationMissing
You receive six bronnze throwing darts from Al Shabim.~|~translationMissing
I'll take that key off your hands as well effendi! Many thanks!~|~translationMissing
*** Dart Construction *** Congratulations! You can now construct darts.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and here is your pineapple!~|~translationMissing
You receive a tasty looking pineapple from Al Shabim~|~translationMissing
Many thanks with your help previously Effendi!~|~translationMissing
Here is another pineapple, try not to lose this one.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Goodbye!~|~translationMissing
Oh great!~|~translationMissing
The guard rolls his eyes in glee and takes a bite of the pineapple. His face turns from pleasure to pain as he spits the mouthful of pineapple out.~|~translationMissing
Yeuch! That's awful! That's not Tenti pineapple! It's got no juice! Get me some Tenti pineapple if you know what's good for you. A whole one so I can see that it's good!~|~translationMissing
Hey... I have something for you!~|~translationMissing
You show the Tenti pineapple to the guard.~|~translationMissing
Great! Just what I've been looking for! Mmmmmmm... Delicious!! This is soo nice! Mmmmm, *SLURP* Yummmm... Oh yes, this is great.~|~translationMissing
So, can I go through now please?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, of course... a deal's a deal!~|~translationMissing
That pineapple was just delicious, many thanks. I don't suppose you could get me another? -- The guard looks at you pleadingly.~|~translationMissing
You must be joking! The last one I gave you cost me double shifts working copper ore! You should be grateful you got one at all.~|~translationMissing
Alright, alright, I was only asking!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, whaddya want... get out of here!~|~translationMissing
The guards search you thoroughly as you go through the gates.[sic]~|~translationMissing
You walk into the darkness of the cavern...~|~translationMissing
... and emerge in a different part of this huge underground complex.~|~translationMissing
You search the full barrel... It's full of rocks.~|~translationMissing
This looks like a full mining barrel. Slaves use this to load up the rocks and stones that they're mining. This barrel is full of coal.~|~translationMissing
This looks like an empty mining barrel. Slaves use this to load up the rocks and stones that they're mining.~|~translationMissing
If the player is holding Ana in a barrel~|~translationMissing
You cannot carry another barrel while you're carrying Ana.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a barrel~|~translationMissing
You can only manage one of these at a time.~|~translationMissing
This barrel is quite big, but you may be able to carry one. Would you like to take one?~|~translationMissing
Take an empty barrel?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, cool!~|~translationMissing
You take the barrel, it's not that heavy, just awkward.~|~translationMissing
Move along now...~|~translationMissing
This guard looks as if he's been in the sun for a while.~|~translationMissing
Yes, what do you want?~|~translationMissing
Nothing thanks - sorry for disturbing you.~|~translationMissing
Well... I guess that's okay, get on your way though.~|~translationMissing
Your head on a stick.~|~translationMissing
Why you ungrateful whelp.. I'll teach you some manners.~|~translationMissing
(Continues with getting jailed dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
This looks like a lift of some sort. You see barrels of rocks being placed on the lift and they're hauled up to the surface.~|~translationMissing
Hey there, what do you want?~|~translationMissing
What is this thing?~|~translationMissing
It is quite clearly a lift. Any fool can see that it's used to transport rock to the surface.~|~translationMissing
Can I use this?~|~translationMissing
Of course not, you'd be doing me out of a job. Anyway, you haven't got any barrels that need to go to the surface.~|~translationMissing
Now, move along and get some work done before you get a good beating.~|~translationMissing
Oh, want a fight do you!~|~translationMissing
This cart is being unloaded into this section of the mine. Before being sent back to another section for another load.~|~translationMissing
You search the mine cart...~|~translationMissing
There may be just enough space to squeeze yourself into the cart. Would you like to try?~|~translationMissing
Squeeze into the cart?~|~translationMissing
Ana (in a Barrel)~|~translationMissing
There isn't enough space for both you and this barrel in the cart.~|~translationMissing
You fail to fit yourself into the cart in time before it starts its journey.~|~translationMissing
If the player bangs their head~|~translationMissing
You bang your head on the cart as you try to jump in.~|~translationMissing
If the player falls off~|~translationMissing
You jump onto the edge of the cart, but fall off.~|~translationMissing
You appear in a large open room with what looks like lots of miners working away. This is a very rough looking area, the miners look like they're on their last legs.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, it looks pretty dangerous.~|~translationMissing
You decide not to get into the dangerous looking mine cart.~|~translationMissing
This mine cart is being loaded up with new rocks and stone. It gets sent to a different section of the mine for unloading.~|~translationMissing
You appear back in the barrel loading room. A nearby slave looks surprised to see you popping out of the cart.~|~translationMissing
You search the gates... yep, they're locked.~|~translationMissing
A nearby guard looks you over. He doesn't seem too impressed.~|~translationMissing
It looks as if this is where very difficult prisoners are sent as a punishment.~|~translationMissing
The gate seems to be locked.~|~translationMissing
The nearby guard doesn't want to let you in.~|~translationMissing
Hey, move away from the gate. There's nothing interesting for you here.~|~translationMissing
Hey, move away from the gate. If you wanna get out you're gonna have to mine for it. You're gonna have to bring me 15 loads of rocks in one go!~|~translationMissing
And then I'll let you out. You can go back to work with the other slaves then!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I have all your rocks here, let me out now. -- The guard unlocks the gate. --~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay, come on out.~|~translationMissing
Okay, you've got all the rocks, you can go now, but keep your nose clean in future.~|~translationMissing
Ana~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I don't think I've seen you before.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm new here!~|~translationMissing
I thought so you know! How do you like the hospitality down here? Not exactly Al Kharid town style is it? Well, I guess I'd better get back to work.~|~translationMissing
Don't want to get into trouble with the guards again.~|~translationMissing
Do you get into trouble with guards often?~|~translationMissing
No, not really, because I'm usually working very hard. Come to think of it, I'd better get back to work.~|~translationMissing
Do you enjoy it down here?~|~translationMissing
Of course not! I just don't have much choice about it a[sic] the moment.~|~translationMissing
I want to try and get you out of here.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any ideas about how we can get out of here?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, not really, I would have tried them already if I did. The guards seem to live in the compound. How did you get in there anyway?~|~translationMissing
I managed to sneak past the guards.~|~translationMissing
Huh, these guards are rubbish, it was easy to sneak past them!~|~translationMissing
Okay, see ya!~|~translationMissing
Goodbye and good luck!~|~translationMissing
I want to try and get you out of here!~|~translationMissing
Wow! You're brave. How do you propose we do that? In case you hadn't noticed, this place is quite well guarded.~|~translationMissing
We could try to sneak out.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound very likely. How did you get in here anyway? Did you deliberately hand yourself over to the guards? Ha, ha ha ha! Sorry, just kidding.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, impressive, but can you so easily sneak out again? How did you manage to get through the gate?~|~translationMissing
I have a key.~|~translationMissing
I heard that! So you used a key did you?!~|~translationMissing
If the player is holding the key~|~translationMissing
Right, we'll have that key off you!~|~translationMissing
It's a trade secret!~|~translationMissing
Oh, right, well, I guess you know what you're doing. Anyway, I have to get back to work. The guards will come along soon and give us some trouble else.~|~translationMissing
I heard that! So you managed to sneak in did you!~|~translationMissing
Have you got any suggestions?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, let me think...~|~translationMissing
No, sorry...~|~translationMissing
The only thing that gets out of here is the rock that we mine.~|~translationMissing
Not even the dead get a decent funeral. Bodies are just thrown down disused mine holes. It's very disrespectful...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll check around for another way to try and get out.~|~translationMissing
How does the rock get out?~|~translationMissing
Well, we mine it in this section, then someone scoops it into a barrel. The barrels are loaded onto a mine cart. Then they're deposited near the surface lift.~|~translationMissing
I have no idea where they go from there. But that's not going to help us, is it?~|~translationMissing
Maybe? I'll come back to you when I have a plan.~|~translationMissing
Okay, well, I'm not going anywhere! -- Ana nods at a nearby guard!-- Unless he feels generous enough to let me go! -- The guard ignores the comment. --~|~translationMissing
Oh well, I'd better get back to work, you take care!~|~translationMissing
Where would I get one of those barrels from?~|~translationMissing
Well, you would get one from around by the lift area. But why would you want one of those?~|~translationMissing
Er no reason! Just wondering.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, just don't get any funny ideas... I am not going to get into one of those barrels! Okay, have you got that?~|~translationMissing
Okay, yep, I've got that.~|~translationMissing
Good, just make sure you keep it in mind. Anyway, I have to get back to work. The guards will come along soon and give us some trouble else.~|~translationMissing
Well, we'll see, it might be the only way.~|~translationMissing
No, there has to be a better way! Anyway, I have to get back to work. The guards will come along soon and give us some trouble else.~|~translationMissing
I could try to sneak you out if you were in a barrel!~|~translationMissing
There is no way you are getting me into a barrel. No WAY! DO you understand?~|~translationMissing
What's your name.~|~translationMissing
My name? Oh, how sweet, my name is Ana. I come from Al-Kharid though we've only recently moved there. I was born, and did most of my growing up, in Varrock. I thought the desert might be interesting.~|~translationMissing
What a surprise I got!~|~translationMissing
What kind of surprise did you get?~|~translationMissing
Well, I was just touring the desert looking for the nomad tribe to the West. And I was set upon by these armoured men.~|~translationMissing
I think that the guards think I am an escaped prisoner. They didn't understand that I was exploring the desert as an adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to go back to Al-Kharid?~|~translationMissing
Sure, I miss my Mum, her name is Irena and she is probably waiting for me. How do you propose we get out of here though?~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you've noticed the many square jawed guards around here. You look like you can handle yourself, but I have my doubts that you can take them all on!~|~translationMissing
Hello there, how's it going? Do you have a plan to get out of here yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, sorry, what's your name again?~|~translationMissing
My name? Oh, how sweet, my name is Ana. I come from Al Kharid though we've only recently moved there. I was born, and did most of my growing up, in Varrock. I thought the desert might be interesting.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm working on it, have you got any suggestions?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, have you been in any more trouble with the guards?~|~translationMissing
No, not not so far. I've been working very hard. Not like some people I know -- She cocks a smirk at you. --~|~translationMissing
Hey, what do you think you're doing?~|~translationMissing
-- You manage to squeeze Ana into the barrel, -- -- despite her many complaints. -- I djont fit in dis bawwel... Wet me out!!~|~translationMissing
Shush... It's for your own good!~|~translationMissing
You drop the barrel on the floor, Ana gets out.~|~translationMissing
Ana's outburst attracts the guards, they come running over.~|~translationMissing
Hey! What's going on here then?~|~translationMissing
The guards drag Ana away and then throw you into a cell.~|~translationMissing
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Leave me alone and let me get on with my work. Else we'll both be in trouble. Oh no, NOT AGAIN!~|~translationMissing
-- Ana looks pretty angry, she starts shouting at you. -- Get me out of here! Do you hear me! Get me OUT OF HERE I say!~|~translationMissing
You carefully place Ana in the barrel into the mine cart. Soon the cart moves out of sight and then it returns.~|~translationMissing
You can see plenty of barrels, but not the one with Ana in it.~|~translationMissing
You search the barrels and find Ana.~|~translationMissing
Let me out!~|~translationMissing
You're carrying so many items that you cannot manage Ana as well.~|~translationMissing
You pick up Ana in a Barrel.~|~translationMissing
You dare not put the barrel back in the mine cart. The guards might see you.~|~translationMissing
The guard notices the barrel (with Ana in it) that you're carrying.~|~translationMissing
Hey, that Barrel looks heavy, do you need a hand?~|~translationMissing
The guard comes over and helps you. He takes one end of the barrel.~|~translationMissing
Blimey! This is heavy!~|~translationMissing
Why you cheeky....!~|~translationMissing
~ The guard looks around, surprised at Ana's outburst. ~ What was that?~|~translationMissing
Oh, it was nothing.~|~translationMissing
I could have sworn I heard something!~|~translationMissing
Yes you did you ignoramus.~|~translationMissing
What was that you said?~|~translationMissing
I said you were very gregarious!~|~translationMissing
You creep!~|~translationMissing
Oh, right, how very nice of you to say so.  -- The guard seems flattered. --~|~translationMissing
Anyway, let's get this barrel up to the surface, plenty more work for you to do!~|~translationMissing
The guard places the barrel carefully on the lift platform.~|~translationMissing
Oh, there's no one operating the lift up top, hope this barrel isn't urgent? You'd better get back to work!~|~translationMissing
Oh, nothing.~|~translationMissing
I heard you say something, now spit it out!~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I can manage.~|~translationMissing
Ok, fair enough, I was only offering.~|~translationMissing
Hey, you'd better go and operate that lift yourself if you want that big heavy barrel to go anywhere.~|~translationMissing
Ana is in a barrel on the lift underground, she's not here!~|~translationMissing
Hey, where d'ya think you're going with that Barrel?~|~translationMissing
A guard comes over and takes the barrel off you.~|~translationMissing
Cor! This barrel is really heavy! Have you been mining lead?~|~translationMissing
Har, har har!~|~translationMissing
Ana-in-barrel~|~translationMissing
How rude! Why I ought to teach you a lesson.~|~translationMissing
What was that!~|~translationMissing
The guard kicks the barrel open!~|~translationMissing
How dare you say that I'm as heavy as lead?~|~translationMissing
This looks like a winch, it probably brings rocks up from underground.~|~translationMissing
You try to operate the winch.~|~translationMissing
You see a barrel coming to the surface. Before too long you haul it onto the side. The barrel seems quite heavy and you hear a muffled sound coming from inside.~|~translationMissing
Ana (in-a-barrel),~|~translationMissing
Get me OUT OF HERE![sic]~|~translationMissing
You operate the winch but nothing significant seems to happen.~|~translationMissing
This looks like an interesting mining barrel.~|~translationMissing
You search the barrel and find Ana.~|~translationMissing
Let me out of here, I feel sick!~|~translationMissing
Hey! Where d'ya think you're going with that barrel?~|~translationMissing
You should know that they go out on the cart!~|~translationMissing
I'd better check this out.~|~translationMissing
Blimey - it's a jail break!  Guards! Guards! Apprehend them!~|~translationMissing
They're making a break for it!~|~translationMissing
I could have told you that we wouldn't get away with it! Now look at the mess you've caused.~|~translationMissing
The guards grab Ana and drag her away.~|~translationMissing
Hey, watch it with the hands buster.~|~translationMissing
These are the up market slaves clothes doncha know!~|~translationMissing
A sturdy looking cart for carrying barrels of rocks out of the mining camp.~|~translationMissing
The cart driver seems to be busy inspecting the cart for defects.~|~translationMissing
There should be enough space for Ana (in the barrel) to go on here.~|~translationMissing
You place Ana (In the barrel) carefully on the cart. This was the last barrel to go on the cart, but the cart driver doesn't seem to be in any rush to get going. And the desert heat will soon get to Ana.~|~translationMissing
You can see the barrel with Ana in it on the cart already.~|~translationMissing
The cart driver seems to be festidiously cleaning his cart. It doesn't look as if he wants to be disturbed.~|~translationMissing
Can't you see I'm busy? Now get out of here!~|~translationMissing
Oh, okay, sorry.~|~translationMissing
Look just leave me alone!~|~translationMissing
The cart driver goes back to his work.~|~translationMissing
Nice cart.~|~translationMissing
Pssst...~|~translationMissing
The cart driver looks around at you and tries to weigh you up.~|~translationMissing
He tuts to himself and starts checking the wheels.~|~translationMissing
Tut?!~|~translationMissing
The cart driver chuckles to himself.~|~translationMissing
I wonder if you could help me?~|~translationMissing
Sorry friend, I'm busy, go bug the guards, I'm sure they'll give ya the time of day.~|~translationMissing
He, he, he, ha!~|~translationMissing
Can you get me the heck out of here please?~|~translationMissing
No way, and if you bug me again, I'm gonna call the guards.~|~translationMissing
One wagon wheel says to the other, 'I'll see you around'.~|~translationMissing
-- The cart driver smirks a little. --~|~translationMissing
He starts checking the steering on the cart.~|~translationMissing
'One good turn deserves another'~|~translationMissing
'One good turn deserves another.'~|~translationMissing
The cart driver smiles a bit and then turns to you.~|~translationMissing
Are you trying to get me fired?~|~translationMissing
It certainly sounds like it, now leave me alone. If you bug me again, I'm gonna call the guards.~|~translationMissing
And why would you want to do a crazy thing like that for? I ought to teach you a lesson! Guards! Guards!~|~translationMissing
Fired... no, shot perhaps!~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha! You're funny! -- The cart driver checks that guards aren't watching. -- What're you in fer?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm not supposed to be here at all actually.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, interesting... let me guess. You're completely innocent... like all the other inmates in here. Ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
The Cart driver goes back to his work.~|~translationMissing
I'm in for murder, so you'd better get me out of here!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well, I wonder what the guards are gonna say about that! Guards! Guards!~|~translationMissing
In for a penny in for a pound.~|~translationMissing
The cart driver laughs at your pun...~|~translationMissing
Ha ha ha, oh stop it!~|~translationMissing
The cart driver seems much happier now.~|~translationMissing
What can I do for you anyway?~|~translationMissing
Can you smuggle me out on your cart?~|~translationMissing
The cart driver points at a nearby guard.~|~translationMissing
Ask that man over there if it's okay and I'll consider it! Ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
The cart driver goes back to his work, laughing to himself.~|~translationMissing
Can you smuggle my friend Ana out on your cart?~|~translationMissing
Can you smuggle my friend out on your cart?~|~translationMissing
As long as your friend is a barrel full of rocks. I don't think it would be a problem at all! Ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
Well, you see, it's like this...~|~translationMissing
Prison riot in ten minutes, get your cart out of here!~|~translationMissing
The cart driver seems visibly shaken...~|~translationMissing
Oh, right..yes... yess, okay...~|~translationMissing
The cart driver quickly starts preparing the cart.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, you too!~|~translationMissing
The cart sets off at a hectic pace. The guards at the gate get suspiscious and search the cart. They find Ana in the Barrel and take her back into the mine.[sic]~|~translationMissing
You can't leave me here, I'll get killed!~|~translationMissing
Oh, right... Okay, you'd better jump in the cart then! Quickly!~|~translationMissing
There's ten gold in it for you if you leave now - no questions asked.~|~translationMissing
There's ten gold in it for you if you leave now no questions asked.~|~translationMissing
If you're going to bribe me, at least make it worth my while. Now, let's say 100 Gold pieces should we? Ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
A hundred it is!~|~translationMissing
A hundred it is.~|~translationMissing
You little cheat, trying to trick me! I'll show you! Guards! Guards!~|~translationMissing
You quickly slope away and hide from the guards.~|~translationMissing
Okay, get in the back of the cart then!~|~translationMissing
Forget it!~|~translationMissing
Okay, fair enough! But don't bother me anymore.~|~translationMissing
I'm quite capable thanks... Now get lost before I call the guards.~|~translationMissing
I could help, I know a lot about carts.~|~translationMissing
Are you saying I don't know anything about carts?~|~translationMissing
Why you cheeky little.... -- The cart driver seems mortally offended -- -- his temper explodes as he calls the guards.-- Guards! Guards!~|~translationMissing
The cart driver completely ignores you.~|~translationMissing
Psssst...~|~translationMissing
The driver completely ignores you.~|~translationMissing
Psssssst...~|~translationMissing
Pssssssssttt!!!~|~translationMissing
beloow~|~translationMissing
The cart driver turns around quickly to face you.~|~translationMissing
What! Can't you see I'm busy?~|~translationMissing
Shhshhh!~|~translationMissing
Shush yourself!~|~translationMissing
The cart driver is busy loading the cart up ...~|~translationMissing
What're you doing carrying that big barrel around? Put it in the back of the cart like all the others!~|~translationMissing
Hurry up, get in the cart or I'll go without you!~|~translationMissing
There is space on the cart for you get on, would you like to try?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'll get on.~|~translationMissing
You decide to climb on the cart.~|~translationMissing
As soon as you get on the cart, it starts to move. Before too long you are past the gates. You jump off the cart taking Ana with you.~|~translationMissing
No, I've got other plans.~|~translationMissing
You decide not to get onto the cart.~|~translationMissing
Attract mine cart drivers attention.~|~translationMissing
I should find Ana before attempting to escape again. She must have been caught by the guards.~|~translationMissing
Hey, great you've found Ana!~|~translationMissing
-- You show Irena the barrel with Ana in it. -- Hey great, there's my Mum!~|~translationMissing
Great! Thanks for getting me out of that mine! And that barrel wasn't too bad anyway! Pop by again sometime, I'm sure we'll have a barrel of laughs!~|~translationMissing
Oh! I nearly forgot! Here's a key I found in the tunnels. It might be of some use to you, not sure what it opens. Sorry, but I have to go now.~|~translationMissing
Ana gives you a wrought iron key...~|~translationMissing
Ana spots Irena and waves...~|~translationMissing
Hi Ana!~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much for returning my daughter to me. I'm really very grateful... I would like to reward you for your bravery and daring.~|~translationMissing
I can offer you increased knowledge in two of the following areas.~|~translationMissing
Fletching.~|~translationMissing
Agility.~|~translationMissing
Smithing.~|~translationMissing
Thieving~|~translationMissing
Okay, now choose your second skill.~|~translationMissing
Okay, that's all the skills I can teach you!~|~translationMissing
Thanks for returning Anna to me, I think she has something else to say to you though!~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much for returning my daughter to me. I'm really very grateful... I would like to reward you for your bravery and daring. I can offer you increased knowledge in two of the following areas.~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much for returning my daughter to me. I'm really very grateful... I would like to reward you for your bravery and daring. I can offer you increased knowledge in one of the following areas.~|~translationMissing
Thanks so much for returning my daughter to me. I expect that she will go on another trip soon though. She is the adventurous type... a bit like yourself really! Okay, see you around then!~|~translationMissing

Er...Hello, Your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Have you come for a particular reason? I am a busy Queen, you know. I had to attend the opening of a new orphanage this morning.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I...~|~translationMissing
And this afternoon I shall be receiving the Embassador of Karamja and accompanying him on his week-long tour of Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
Er, I...~|~translationMissing
Then this evening we shall be putting on a grand ball! All of the kingdom's nobility will be present!~|~translationMissing
If I m...[sic]~|~translationMissing
Oh, who am I kidding...nothing ever happens here. I always wanted to be a princess when I was a girl. If I'd been told it would be like this, I wouldn't have bothered.~|~translationMissing
Your Majesty!~|~translationMissing
Yes? Did you want something?~|~translationMissing
...actually, no.~|~translationMissing
My name is [Fremennik name], will you not let me through?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid the King won't give an audience to anyone except a worthy hero.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Heroes' quest~|~translationMissing
If you become a member of the Heroes' Guild, he will definitely grant you an audience.~|~translationMissing
Then you may pass.~|~translationMissing
Welcome back, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
Good day, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
Greetings, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
The King needs someone to take over the rule of the Kingdom. If I were you, I should consider the position.~|~translationMissing
Who are you? Who seeks audience with the King of this fair land of Miscellania?~|~translationMissing
I am known in these lands as [Fremennik name], Your Majesty. I come in search of a quest.~|~translationMissing
Ah, it pleases me to see such enthusiasm!~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, I was a little too daring, and attempted to brave the icelands, where I finally met my match.~|~translationMissing
I survived, barely, but I was cursed for the rest of my life to stay in this form. Which leaves me incapable of performing my duties as ruler.~|~translationMissing
This is why I am looking for an exceptional soul to be regent of this fair kingdom of Miscellania.~|~translationMissing
Start the Throne of Miscellania quest?~|~translationMissing
If I may be so bold, Your Majesty, I think Miscellania would rest in capable hands with me.~|~translationMissing
Hahaha! You are bold, [Fremennik name], but then I have yet to see a good ruler who was not.~|~translationMissing
Now may be an opportune time to make amends. If you manage to negotiate peace with them, then you will truly have shown your skill as a diplomat.~|~translationMissing
Then do not stray far, Your Majesty, for I shall soon return.~|~translationMissing
Wait! There is one more matter to discuss... a mere formality, of course.~|~translationMissing
By Miscellanious tradition, one may not become regent of the kingdom unless in the trust of the royal family.~|~translationMissing
This includes that of the future king or queen. It is yet too early for me to decide which of my children should inherit the throne.~|~translationMissing
Until then, gaining the trust of one of them should suffice. Who knows? Your choice might help me make a decision later.~|~translationMissing
So tell me! Which of my children will you attempt to gain the trust of?~|~translationMissing
I want to earn Prince Brand's approval.~|~translationMissing
I would like to choose Prince Brand.~|~translationMissing
And you say this is a mere formality, Your Majesty?~|~translationMissing
I want to earn Princess Astrid's approval.~|~translationMissing
I would like to choose Princess Astrid.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I must decline, Your Majesty. The call of adventure is too strong for me to accept a sedentary life.~|~translationMissing
I can assure you that I managed to heed that same call, and ruling this land was no hindrance to me. However, I understand your decision. Fare thee well!~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you talked to Queen Sigrid of Etceteria?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, Your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
(If the player is gaining the approval of Princess Astrid~|~translationMissing
) I want to earn Prince Brand's approval instead.~|~translationMissing
I want to earn Prince Brand's approval instead.~|~translationMissing
Earn Prince Brand's approval instead?~|~translationMissing
Yes, Your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. Good luck!~|~translationMissing
No, I changed my mind.~|~translationMissing
As you wish. I will keep this conversation between us.~|~translationMissing
(If the player is gaining the approval of Prince Brand~|~translationMissing
) I want to earn Princess Astrid's approval instead.~|~translationMissing
I want to earn Princess Astrid's approval instead.~|~translationMissing
Earn Princess Astrid's approval instead?~|~translationMissing
Is that so? I can let them both know, but you may find that the Prince has taken the news rather coldly. A broken trust is difficult to mend.~|~translationMissing
Is that so? I can let them both know, but you may find that the Princess has taken the news rather coldly. A broken trust is difficult to mend.~|~translationMissing
Negotiating peace with Etceteria, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
How do I make peace with Etceteria?~|~translationMissing
You should go talk to Queen Sigrid of Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
How am I supposed to gain the trust of the Prince?~|~translationMissing
I think you may find that talking to him would be a good way to start.~|~translationMissing
A ring may be an appropriate gift to formalise your friendship[sic]~|~translationMissing
Is there anything else you can tell me?~|~translationMissing
What would you like to know, [Sir/Madam]?~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about the King?~|~translationMissing
King Vargas was once a brave and noble adventurer, well-loved by his subjects. Unfortunately, he was cursed while seeking a quest in the icelands to the north, and is now unable to reign.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about the Prince?~|~translationMissing
He has no interest in ruling the kingdom, and seems to spend his time daydreaming or composing quite awful poems, and sagas of totally mundane events.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about the Princess?~|~translationMissing
Princess Astrid thinks she'd be perfectly capable of ruling the kingdom, but her father doesn't trust her enough by herself.~|~translationMissing
Especially since she devotes herself to the - as the King sees it - cowardly skill of archery rather than the noble skill of melee combat...~|~translationMissing
She is fond of jewellery, and of course she collects bows. She is also quite the conversationalist.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not gained the trust of Princess Astrid~|~translationMissing
Many have tried to capture her attention, but she has yet to be impressed by any of them.~|~translationMissing
If the player has gained the trust of Princess Astrid~|~translationMissing
Many have tried to capture her attention, but you are the first to succeed.~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about Queen Sigrid?~|~translationMissing
Queen Sigrid is quite envious of King Vargas, since he has the larger kingdom.~|~translationMissing
The King and she have never seen eye-to-eye, but I think if you approach her you may find her quite reasonable.~|~translationMissing
No thank you, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
Bow, wave, or goblin bow~|~translationMissing
Angry, cry, or panic~|~translationMissing
What's wrong, [Sir/Madam]?~|~translationMissing
Cheer~|~translationMissing
If you want to cheer someone on, [Sir/Madam], I suggest you find my brother.~|~translationMissing
Beckon~|~translationMissing
I'm staying right here.~|~translationMissing
Laugh~|~translationMissing
What's so funny, [Sir/Madam]?~|~translationMissing
Jump for joy, raspberry, salute, or hypermobile drinker~|~translationMissing
Dance, jig, spin, headbang, or goblin salute~|~translationMissing
You dance well, [Sir/Madam]?~|~translationMissing
Blow kiss~|~translationMissing
Sorry, [Sir/Madam], but I'm not interested.~|~translationMissing
Clap~|~translationMissing
If you want to applaud someone, [Sir/Madam], I suggest you find my brother.~|~translationMissing
I couldn't possibly accept this.~|~translationMissing
As I'm sure you are aware, your father the King is seeking someone to rule the Kingdom in his stead. I have put myself forward, but in order for me to become ruler...~|~translationMissing
...you have to earn my approval?~|~translationMissing
Yes, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
Ahahahaha!~|~translationMissing
Come now, what interest would I have in a crass adventurer like yourself? What would you know of the poetry that flows through my veins like an avalanche through a peaceful mountain village?~|~translationMissing
I think you may find I know good poetry when I see it, Your Royal Highness...~|~translationMissing
(If the player hasn't answered this branch correctly yet~|~translationMissing
I composed a poem, would you like to hear it?~|~translationMissing
Of course, I'd love to.~|~translationMissing
I got up This morning, And had an egg For breakfast~|~translationMissing
(The first three dialogue options are ordered randomly, and the fourth option is picked randomly from below.)~|~translationMissing
No, that's the whole poem.~|~translationMissing
Oh. I see.~|~translationMissing
Be still, my heart.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you liked it.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't even rhyme!~|~translationMissing
Quiet! What would you know about poetry?~|~translationMissing
[Random option]~|~translationMissing
I am surprised you do not have hordes of admirers vying to be your significant other, Your Highness.~|~translationMissing
And why do you think that might be, [Sir/Madam]?~|~translationMissing
No-one's ever heard of you.~|~translationMissing
I am insulted, [Sir/Madam]!~|~translationMissing
They don't understand your poetry as I do.~|~translationMissing
Mmm, a very good answer, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
They're all already married.~|~translationMissing
Hm, no, I don't think that's the right reason.~|~translationMissing
So, you practice the harp? I see you have one over there.~|~translationMissing
You should listen to your father.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry you feel that way.~|~translationMissing
You will be the greatest bard!~|~translationMissing
I'm so glad you agree!~|~translationMissing
You're an awful bard.~|~translationMissing
(One of the following dialogue options is shown randomly as the fourth option in the above dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
Beards? Dangerous, flammable and make you look mad!~|~translationMissing
Care to sign my petition for pet frogs?~|~translationMissing
Cattle prod? Weapon of choice I reckon.~|~translationMissing
Don't threaten me with a dead fish!~|~translationMissing
He is clearly 1 cup short of a full service.~|~translationMissing
I'm a little teapot, short and stout...~|~translationMissing
I'm rubber you're glue.........!~|~translationMissing
Lies!!! It's all lies!!!~|~translationMissing
Look over there! A King Black Dragon!~|~translationMissing
Lumbridge? No, I wouldn't be seen dead there.~|~translationMissing
Nah, that Kalphite was weedier than your garden.~|~translationMissing
Selling ring of poverty 30 mil!~|~translationMissing
Sneaky sneaky stick da chompy.~|~translationMissing
What level do you need to cook cats?~|~translationMissing
Are these for me? Really?~|~translationMissing
Of course, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
Thank you! They're lovely!~|~translationMissing
No, I was just showing you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, all right.~|~translationMissing
You've already given me some, but thank you.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. It's nice to be appreciated.~|~translationMissing
Jump for joy, raspberry, salute, glass box, climb rope, lean, glass wall, or hypermobile drinker~|~translationMissing
You are silly!~|~translationMissing
Dance, jig, spin, headbang, zombie dance, or goblin salute~|~translationMissing
You dance well, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
Let's not get ahead of ourselves now, [Sir/Madam]!~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
You have perhaps more poetry in your soul than I first thought, [Sir/Madam]...~|~translationMissing
I'm flattered to hear you say so, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
Oh, but I realise you have not yet told me your name!~|~translationMissing
My name is [Fremennik name], Your Highness.~|~translationMissing
Then I shall I call you [Fremennik name], [Sir/Madam], and you shall call me Prince.~|~translationMissing
Very well, Prince.~|~translationMissing
What's wrong, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
What's so funny, [Fremennik name]?~|~translationMissing
You dance well, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Let's not get ahead of ourselves now, [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
So, why did you decide to become a bard?~|~translationMissing
Poetry and music have always fascinated me. I am drawn to them like a moth to an overenthusiastic mage who has set himself on fire.~|~translationMissing
(The first three dialogue options are ordered randomly, and the fourth option is picked randomly from above.)~|~translationMissing
How poetic.~|~translationMissing
Why thank you. Sometimes I amaze even myself.~|~translationMissing
That's a strange metaphor...~|~translationMissing
It is a simile, but what do you know of poetry?~|~translationMissing
Wait, are you the moth or the mage?~|~translationMissing
The moth!~|~translationMissing
I composed a saga, would you like to hear it?~|~translationMissing
I don't know if I have time for a whole saga...~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, it's quite short. Here we go!~|~translationMissing
Once upon a time there was a Prince, And Brand was his name, He always had a song in his heart, And a rhyme in his head,~|~translationMissing
And he became the world's greatest bard, And delighted one and all, With his songs and sagas, And Brand was his name!~|~translationMissing
How inspiring!~|~translationMissing
Thank you! I thought I would compose something for future generations, to tell them my story.~|~translationMissing
I think my ears are bleeding.~|~translationMissing
If you don't appreciate my singing, you are free to leave!~|~translationMissing
That's not a saga!~|~translationMissing
It's a short one, I'll admit...~|~translationMissing
What would you do if you became ruler of Miscellania?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I would never concern myself with such trivial matters as those involved in ruling a Kingdom. My interests lie solely in the arts.~|~translationMissing
A much nobler pursuit, to be sure.~|~translationMissing
I am glad you agree.~|~translationMissing
If only you were any good at them...~|~translationMissing
I am insulted, [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
You're just afraid of responsibility.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you are right...~|~translationMissing
Good day, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Good day, my Prince.~|~translationMissing
No thank you, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Is this for me? Really?~|~translationMissing
Of course, Prince.~|~translationMissing
Thank you! It's lovely!~|~translationMissing
You've already given me one, but thank you.~|~translationMissing
I must admit I am growing quite fond of you, [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Could it be, my Prince, that you would consider trusting a crass adventurer such as myself to run your kingdom?~|~translationMissing
No thank you, darling.~|~translationMissing
I wrote a song about you. Would you like to hear it?~|~translationMissing
I'd love to!~|~translationMissing
Your hair is like a waterfall Or perhaps a bramble bush Your eyes are like an ocean on which I want to sail the ship of our connection!~|~translationMissing
Eyes...ship...sail...what?~|~translationMissing
Was it really that hard to understand?~|~translationMissing
That was awful!~|~translationMissing
Fine! See if I write you any more songs!~|~translationMissing
That was lovely. I'm touched!~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you liked it, my [darling/dear].~|~translationMissing
Tell me, have you ever composed any poems yourself?~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't presume to have the skill...~|~translationMissing
You're right, it takes great skill and inspiration to be a great poet such as myself.~|~translationMissing
Not really, but it can't be that hard.~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to understand poetry at all...~|~translationMissing
There once was a man from Varrock...~|~translationMissing
Don't lower the art of poetry with such bawdy rhymes!~|~translationMissing
What do you think of your sister?~|~translationMissing
We don't always see eye-to-eye, but she understands my art better than our father.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad to hear it.~|~translationMissing
Of course, she couldn't understand as well as you do, my [darling/dear].~|~translationMissing
What art is that?~|~translationMissing
Music and poetry. Surely you haven't forgotten already?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry you think so.~|~translationMissing
Hello, [darling/dear][sic]~|~translationMissing
Hello, my Prince.~|~translationMissing
What's wrong, [darling/dear]?~|~translationMissing
What's so funny, [darling/dear]?~|~translationMissing
You dance well, [darling/dear].~|~translationMissing
You flatter me, my [darling/dear].~|~translationMissing
Thank you, [darling/dear].~|~translationMissing
Yes, a gift fit for my prince!~|~translationMissing
Would you like to ask Prince Brand to marry you?~|~translationMissing
What a beautiful gift! I think you'd make a great Thane running our realm. Can you inform my father that you have earned my trust?~|~translationMissing
You give Prince Brand the ring.~|~translationMissing
How fares the kingdom?~|~translationMissing
All is well...~|~translationMissing
All is well, my Prince[sic]~|~translationMissing
Prince Brand, will you marry me?~|~translationMissing
Oh, my [darling/dear], you've made me the happiest person alive.~|~translationMissing
Is that a yes?~|~translationMissing
Yes! We'll have to put off the actual ceremony until we can find a priest, but you can tell my father I have agreed to marry you.~|~translationMissing
No, my dear, I was just showing you.~|~translationMissing
You've already given me one, remember?~|~translationMissing
How are you doing, [darling/dear]? Have you convinced my father yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, dear~|~translationMissing
Not yet, my dear.~|~translationMissing
I'm having second thoughts about the wedding.~|~translationMissing
I'm having second thoughts about the wedding. This marriage would change things, with an increase in responsibilities and duties you were keen to avoid.~|~translationMissing
While I want to support the kingdom, I don't want that to end up impacting your life negatively. Maybe it's too soon to make this kind of decision.~|~translationMissing
You're right, I am not interested in more responsibilities. I would have less time for poetry! Is that your final decision?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I think it's for the best.~|~translationMissing
Well, I think you'll make a great Thane for our kingdom.~|~translationMissing
Maybe not.~|~translationMissing
Maybe not. It is hard, for I am so very fond of you. Let's leave it as it is for now and see what the future holds.~|~translationMissing
Agreed.~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- All emotes should be confirmed post diversity update edit)~|~translationMissing
Cheer or clap~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Need post-diversity update - historical dialogue included here edit)~|~translationMissing
...you have to marry somebody in the royal family, namely me?~|~translationMissing
You realise, I hope, that I have many suitors.~|~translationMissing
I take it you are not especially fond of any of them?~|~translationMissing
So, you practice archery? I see you have a bow mounted on your wall.~|~translationMissing
Archers are all cowards!~|~translationMissing
I am insulted, Sir!~|~translationMissing
Archery is a noble art!~|~translationMissing
So, tell me about all these other suitors you have.~|~translationMissing
They never cease to bother me. They swarm around me like flies, all hoping to win my heart.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I should use them for target practice!~|~translationMissing
I don't know why they bother...~|~translationMissing
I don't know why YOU bother.~|~translationMissing
I was only joking.~|~translationMissing
I can hold them still for you if you like.~|~translationMissing
How do you know I wouldn't hit you as well?~|~translationMissing
I have confidence in your skills, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
What do you think of Advisor Ghrim?~|~translationMissing
He's a bit scary sometimes, but he's always so nice to me! When I was young, I called him Uncle Ghrim.~|~translationMissing
I think he's far too grumpy.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure he'd lighten up if you were nicer.~|~translationMissing
He's been very helpful.~|~translationMissing
Yes, my father made a wise decision when he chose him to be his advisor.~|~translationMissing
No wonder you turned out like this...~|~translationMissing
I'm insulted, Sir!~|~translationMissing
Impressive. I like someone who knows how to dance.~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Needs to be confirmed post diversity update edit)~|~translationMissing
You are perhaps a more interesting man than I first took you for, Sir...~|~translationMissing
Then may I call you [Fremennik name], Sir?~|~translationMissing
If I may call you Astrid, Your Royal Highness.~|~translationMissing
You may call me 'Princess'.~|~translationMissing
Very well, Princess.~|~translationMissing
If you want to cheer someone on, [Fremennik name], I suggest you find my brother.~|~translationMissing
If you want to applaud someone, [Fremennik name], I suggest you find my brother.~|~translationMissing
What would you do if you ruled this Kingdom?~|~translationMissing
Very little. It's not as if there's much to it... I might try to set up trade with other islands.~|~translationMissing
That's not very enterprising.~|~translationMissing
Fine. You try to do better!~|~translationMissing
That sounds like a good idea.~|~translationMissing
What a silly idea!~|~translationMissing
What a silly idea! As if anyone would be interested!~|~translationMissing
Watch it, or you won't get the chance to do better.~|~translationMissing
So what's the history of these islands?~|~translationMissing
Well, nothing very exciting ever happened until my father declared war on Etceteria...~|~translationMissing
Why did he do that?~|~translationMissing
Queen Sigrid of Etceteria insulted him.~|~translationMissing
It's not that funny.~|~translationMissing
Well excuse me, Princess!~|~translationMissing
He probably deserved it.~|~translationMissing
I'm insulted, [Fremennik name]!~|~translationMissing
He realised that neither of us have an army.~|~translationMissing
So why are you so interested in archery?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure. Even when I was little, archery always fascinated me.~|~translationMissing
I'm quite fond of it myself.~|~translationMissing
It's good to know someone who shares my interests.~|~translationMissing
You should stick to knitting.~|~translationMissing
I'll knit you a lovely jumper, shall I? It'll keep you warm when I have you exiled to the icelands.~|~translationMissing
You should try swordfighting instead.~|~translationMissing
That's not really the kind of thing I'm interested in.~|~translationMissing
Good day, Princess.~|~translationMissing
Of course, Princess.~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Confirm this section post diversity update edit)~|~translationMissing
My, could it be that I have succeeded where so many before me have failed, and finally melted the heart of the fair Princess?~|~translationMissing
No thank you, dear.~|~translationMissing
So, my dear, what do you think of Miscellania?~|~translationMissing
It's a lovely little country.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you like it.~|~translationMissing
It's boring.~|~translationMissing
Then perhaps you shouldn't be thinking of becoming its ruler.~|~translationMissing
Well, I've seen better...~|~translationMissing
I'm quite fond of it myself...~|~translationMissing
What do you think of your brother?~|~translationMissing
We don't always get along, but I'm sure he's a nice guy at heart.~|~translationMissing
And what a great bard he makes!~|~translationMissing
Haha! Oh yes, quite the bard, he is.~|~translationMissing
I have heard better drains!~|~translationMissing
You don't sound like a nightingale yourself!~|~translationMissing
I really don't like him.~|~translationMissing
That's not a nice thing to say.~|~translationMissing
Do you go out into battle often?~|~translationMissing
Not often, no. I sometimes go hunting...~|~translationMissing
And you call yourself an archer?~|~translationMissing
I take what chance for practice I can get.~|~translationMissing
Hunting the mighty rabbits outside the castle?~|~translationMissing
Hunting the mighty rabbits outside the castle? Slaying the foul fowl that terrorises the town?~|~translationMissing
That's not funny.~|~translationMissing
I suppose you don't have much opportunity to.~|~translationMissing
Exactly! Perhaps you could take me with you sometime, dear.~|~translationMissing
What's wrong, dear?~|~translationMissing
If you want to cheer someone on, dear, I suggest you find my brother.~|~translationMissing
What's so funny, dear?~|~translationMissing
That's very sweet, darling.~|~translationMissing
If you want to applaud someone, dear, I suggest you find my brother.~|~translationMissing
Hello, darling.~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Need to confirm this section post diversity update edit)~|~translationMissing
Yes, a gift fit for my princess!~|~translationMissing
Would you like to ask Princess Astrid to marry you?~|~translationMissing
You give Princess Astrid the ring.~|~translationMissing
All is well, Princess.~|~translationMissing
Princess Astrid, will you marry me?~|~translationMissing
Oh, my darling, you've made me the happiest person alive.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing, darling? Have you convinced my father yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, darling~|~translationMissing
Not yet, my darling.~|~translationMissing
I'm having second thoughts about the wedding. This marriage would change things, with an increase in responsibilities and duties that would overshadow the activities you like.~|~translationMissing
While I want to support you and the kingdom, I don't want that to end up impacting your life negatively. Maybe it's too soon to make this kind of decision.~|~translationMissing
My darling, that is very thoughtful of you and you make a convincing point. Are you... absolutely sure?~|~translationMissing
I think you'll make a great Thane for our kingdom.~|~translationMissing
Maybe not. It it hard, for I am so very fond of you. Let's leave it as it is for now and see what the future holds.~|~translationMissing
(If the player gained the trust of Prince Brand~|~translationMissing
) I think Princess Astrid would make the best heir.~|~translationMissing
I think Princess Astrid would make the best heir.~|~translationMissing
Is that your honest opinion after having spent time with my son? The Prince might receive the news rather coldly. A broken trust is difficult to mend.~|~translationMissing
Recommend Princess Astrid for heir?~|~translationMissing
As you wish. I will pay heed to your recommendation.~|~translationMissing
(If the player gained the trust of Princess Astrid~|~translationMissing
) I think Prince Brand would make the best heir.~|~translationMissing
I think Prince Brand would make the best heir.~|~translationMissing
Is that your honest opinion after having spent time with my daughter? The Princess might receive the news rather coldly. A broken trust is difficult to mend.~|~translationMissing
Recommend Prince Brand for heir?~|~translationMissing
If I m...~|~translationMissing
I have been sent by King Vargas to negotiate a treaty of peace between your two great nations.~|~translationMissing
Great nations? Don't make me laugh. Still, peace sounds like a nice idea. He will, of course, have to recognise Etceteria officially as a sovereign nation.~|~translationMissing
This isn't already the case?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. Last time we met I called him a pompous old fool for thinking he was still worth anything as an adventurer.~|~translationMissing
He promptly declared war, claiming the land of Etceteria belonged to Miscellania.~|~translationMissing
When he realised neither of us had an army, he was ever so angry!~|~translationMissing
What happened then?~|~translationMissing
He set off for the icelands to prove me wrong and, well, I expect you saw what happened to him.~|~translationMissing
I shall go ask him to officially recognise Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Have you talked to Vargas yet?~|~translationMissing
I have, Your Majesty. She says she will agree to peace as long as Miscellania recognises Etceteria as a sovereign nation.~|~translationMissing
Hmph! You can tell her I'll officially recognise her country as soon as she changes the Etceterian national anthem.~|~translationMissing
Why is that, Your Majesty?~|~translationMissing
It's insulting! The title alone, ''You're Stupid, We're the Best'', should be enough to give you an idea!~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I can convince her there are better anthems.~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you convinced Sigrid yet?~|~translationMissing
I have, Your Majesty. He says he will recognise the country when you change your anthem.~|~translationMissing
What? But it's a great anthem, I composed it myself! Listen!~|~translationMissing
''You're stupid, we're the best, Etceteria beats the rest! and Queen Sigrid is very pretty, King Vargas is a fool, hey, nonny-nonny!''~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid he insisted, Your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Well, it can't be helped I suppose...~|~translationMissing
You'll have to find a bard to write a new one though. And there isn't a bard to be had for love nor money in Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
I'll see what I can do, Your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Have you found a new anthem yet?~|~translationMissing
You should find someone to compose a new anthem for Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
I need someone to compose a new anthem for Etceteria.~|~translationMissing
You've come to the right bard! I'll write one for you immediately!~|~translationMissing
You can take your time, really...~|~translationMissing
No problem, I'm already done! Here, listen!~|~translationMissing
'Etceteria, Etceteria, Oh what a great country it is, Etceteria, Etceteria, So I wrote a song about it.'~|~translationMissing
'It's somewhere in the sea, And it looks very nice, If it weren't for your ancestors, It wouldn't be there at all,'~|~translationMissing
'And when things aren't going too well, We sing this lovely song, And then we'll all feel so much better, It won't take very long.'~|~translationMissing
Here's a copy, you can keep it!~|~translationMissing
...that's lovely, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Don't mention it, dear[ friend].~|~translationMissing
I lost my copy of the *ahem* theme you composed...~|~translationMissing
Fear not! I made many, many more!~|~translationMissing
Yes, Your Majesty, but I'm afraid it isn't very good.~|~translationMissing
Let's see now...~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, no, this simply won't do. Find a better one.~|~translationMissing
I got Prince Brand to compose a new Etceterian anthem for me, but it's awful!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear. Well, that is only to be expected. May I see it, please?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, yes...allow me to make a few adjustments.~|~translationMissing
There you go, [Sir/Madam]. Are there any other matters in which I may be of assistance?~|~translationMissing
You should get another copy of the anthem.~|~translationMissing
You should show the anthem to Queen Sigrid.~|~translationMissing
I lost the corrected anthem you gave me.~|~translationMissing
Do you have another copy of the prince's anthem for me to correct?~|~translationMissing
If the player has another bad anthem~|~translationMissing
Yes, here it is.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have another bad anthem~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't have one.~|~translationMissing
If you bring me another, I can correct it. Are there any other matters in which I may be of assistance?~|~translationMissing
'Etceteria, Etceteria, Of our country we are proud! Etceteria, Etceteria, Let all sing its name out loud!'~|~translationMissing
'Rising high above the water, The jewel of the North! Our mothers and our fathers, To build this land came forth!'~|~translationMissing
'And in the times of darkness, Sing praises of our land! And in our hearts we can be sure, Our victory is at hand!'~|~translationMissing
Why, this is quite good! I'm surprised!~|~translationMissing
Here is a treaty declaring what we've mutually agreed to. I've already signed, so all it needs is King Vargas' signature and it'll be official.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Has Vargas signed the treaty yet?~|~translationMissing
If the player still has the treaty~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the treaty~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I lost it, Your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
How silly of you. I'll make you another.~|~translationMissing
You should show the treaty to the King.~|~translationMissing
I have here a treaty awaiting your signature.~|~translationMissing
I doubt I will be able to hold an ordinary pen well enough to sign the treaty. You will have to find a pen large enough for me to hold.~|~translationMissing
How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you found me a pen yet?~|~translationMissing
You should find a way to make the nib and body for a very large pen.~|~translationMissing
Derrik~|~translationMissing
Good day, [Sir/Madam]. Can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can I use your anvil?~|~translationMissing
I have a slightly strange request...~|~translationMissing
The King needs to sign a treaty, but is unable to because he lacks a pen large enough for him to hold. Could you make me a nib of the right size?~|~translationMissing
Hm... I may be able to manage that. What sort of size?~|~translationMissing
About the size of a helm should do it.~|~translationMissing
All right, but I'll need an iron bar to make it from.~|~translationMissing
I don't have one with me.~|~translationMissing
Well, come back when you have one.~|~translationMissing
Good. Just a minute...~|~translationMissing
Here you go! One giant pen nib!~|~translationMissing
You place the nib on the end of the log to make a crude pen.~|~translationMissing
Here it is, Your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Excellent! And now, with a flourish, I sign the end of the rivalry between our two proud kingdoms!~|~translationMissing
Now, how's it going with my [son/daughter], will they accept you as regent?~|~translationMissing
[She/He] will, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing
Excellent, excellent.~|~translationMissing
(Continues with dialogue below.)~|~translationMissing
Ghrim tells me that the population is not yet very supportive of the idea of having you as ruler. You should try to gain their support.~|~translationMissing
If the player has killed a citizen of Miscellania~|~translationMissing
I should tell you right away that killing the people of this Kingdom will not make you popular with anyone.~|~translationMissing
Gaining the support of the population, [Sir/Madam].~|~translationMissing
Currently, [number]% of the population supports you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 75%~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than 75%~|~translationMissing
You will need 75% of the population in your support in order to become Regent.~|~translationMissing
How do I gain the support of the population?~|~translationMissing
King Vargas would often go and help out his subjects in their daily tasks, when he was still able to do so, and they loved him dearly for it.~|~translationMissing
Ghrim tells me that the population would be glad to have you as a ruler.~|~translationMissing
I see no reason to delay your regency any further. Ghrim, please proceed with the ceremony.~|~translationMissing
Yes, Your Majesty, I will proceed at once. Ahem...~|~translationMissing
We are gathered here today to witness the rise of a new hero to the regency of the Kingdom of Miscellania, to continue the work of our great King Vargas who is unfortunately now no longer able to rule.~|~translationMissing
By the powers invested in me by the Miscellaneous Constitution, I declare thee, [Fremennik name], to be the new Regent of this fair kingdom.~|~translationMissing
May you bring success and prosperity to Miscellania and to all of its people.~|~translationMissing
...is that all?~|~translationMissing
That is all. I wish you luck as Regent. Speak to Ghrim if you require assistance.~|~translationMissing
Good day, Princess Astrid.~|~translationMissing
Discuss relationship~|~translationMissing
Have you found a priest for our marriage yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, [darling/dear]. I don't think there is one to be had on these islands for love nor money...~|~translationMissing
Good day, Prince Brand.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, darling. I don't think there is one to be had on these islands for love nor money...~|~translationMissing
If the player has agreed to marry~|~translationMissing
If the player has not agreed to marry~|~translationMissing
Greetings, Thane [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
How is the Kingdom faring?~|~translationMissing
Your subjects are worried about the possibility of war, but they are still happy to work for you.~|~translationMissing
Your current approval rating is 75%. I'm afraid your subjects have not yet collected anything.~|~translationMissing
This is how your subjects are distributing their effort.~|~translationMissing
(Managing Miscellania interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
(Continues with Royal Trouble dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
How do I manage the kingdom?~|~translationMissing
Your loyal subjects work hard to collect resources for you. Every day they bring what they have collected to the castle. The resources which they collect are coal from the rocks to the north, maple logs from the trees~|~translationMissing
distributed to them. A maximum of 50k is paid to your subjects and the coffers can store up to 5 million gp. Another thing which affects the amounts of resources collected is your approval rating. The more your~|~translationMissing
subjects love you, the more they will be motivated to work hard. King Vargas would often go and help out his subjects in their daily tasks, when he was still able to do so, and they loved him dearly for it. Finally, you~|~translationMissing
Have you got a copy of my book? It explains everything in more detail.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't...~|~translationMissing
Here, you can have this one, I have plenty spare.~|~translationMissing
Dealing with all the little troubles that come up from time to time, Thane [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Your Majesty...~|~translationMissing
Vargas, you irritating fool. 'Warmongering harpy', indeed!~|~translationMissing
Oh, I apologise. I was merely thinking out loud.~|~translationMissing
How is your kingdom faring?~|~translationMissing
It could be better. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy.~|~translationMissing
Very well, your Majesty.~|~translationMissing

Hi. Interesting building you have here.~|~translationMissing
What's it for?~|~translationMissing
Effigy~|~translationMissing
You like it? It's simply fabulous, isn't it? A real marvel of modern design made just for my fellow alchemists and I!~|~translationMissing
I see some builders over there. So I assume it's not yet finished.~|~translationMissing
What a keen eye this chap has! But imagine this~|~translationMissing
a gargantuan cylinder of expert design, incorporating an inventive inner spiral walkway to multiple planes of wondrous inhabitance!~|~translationMissing
So, it's a tower.~|~translationMissing
Oh, no, no, no, no.~|~translationMissing
It's going to have a use that will change this world!~|~translationMissing
Or at least it would if we could ever get it finished.~|~translationMissing
See those builders?~|~translationMissing
They don't seem to be building much.~|~translationMissing
They've gone on strike for some petty reason about the tower being too weird. I really can't understand those men.~|~translationMissing
Shame.~|~translationMissing
Hey! Maybe you could talk to them?~|~translationMissing
You look like a sturdy chap.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you could finish the work?~|~translationMissing
Come on! This is the chance of a lifetime!~|~translationMissing
Start the Tower of Life quest?~|~translationMissing
Sure, why not.~|~translationMissing
That's fantastic! Oh, I'm so pleased.~|~translationMissing
Calm down. I'm not making any promises.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I have a good feeling about this.~|~translationMissing
Right.~|~translationMissing
Go have a word with Bonafido the head builder. See if you can't get him off his backside to do some work. Oh, and I'm Effigy by the way.~|~translationMissing
Nice to meet you Effigy, I'm [player name]. Hold on and I'll see what I can do!~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Making History~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute.~|~translationMissing
Don't I recognise you from somewhere?~|~translationMissing
Erm, do you?~|~translationMissing
Do you know the outpost north of Ardougne?~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes, it's now a small museum. Jorral's looking after it. He's really making history with that place.~|~translationMissing
Well, the King was going to make that into an alchemy lab for us, but some fool ruined our plans!~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes. Shame. Got to go. Bye.~|~translationMissing
Hey, wait up!~|~translationMissing
Best I go sort out this tower. Bye.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, feeling a bit ill today.~|~translationMissing
A bit ill?~|~translationMissing
That's a weak excuse for a very feeble personality.~|~translationMissing
Guess what!~|~translationMissing
I'm a fully-fledged builder!~|~translationMissing
Marvellous! So you can bring this tower to life!~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure about that, but I'll take a look and see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Oh, what a wondrous person you are!~|~translationMissing
I'm a builder!~|~translationMissing
'Transmute' The Alchemist~|~translationMissing
I question why you are so pleased about this.~|~translationMissing
Well, I think it's a positive step in my career as a courageous adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Hi. Sorry, but why do they call you 'Currency'?~|~translationMissing
'Currency' The Alchemist~|~translationMissing
That's down to my interest in all things of monetary value.~|~translationMissing
You must be pretty rich then.~|~translationMissing
I wish. And I was, up until recently.~|~translationMissing
This tower. Set me back a fair few million.~|~translationMissing
I'll bet! It pleases you, then, to know that I have just become a builder and have been granted permission to go mess around inside.~|~translationMissing
This is not a good day for me.~|~translationMissing
Are you Bonafido by any chance?~|~translationMissing
Bonafido~|~translationMissing
That I am, mate.~|~translationMissing
How can I be of assistance?~|~translationMissing
Well, I've just spoken to Effigy about this tower. He tells me he hired you to work but you're on strike. Something about an extended tea break?~|~translationMissing
Extended cup o' char? E's got it all wrong, mate. We know those alchemi-whatsits are up ta somefin' weird in building this tower, wot wiv all the machinery, and until we get some answers we're not movin a muscle.~|~translationMissing
Well, he wanted me to do something about it.~|~translationMissing
Is there no way I can convince you to continue?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, mate.~|~translationMissing
Well, can I at least have a look inside the tower?~|~translationMissing
Only builders are allowed in there, like. You don't look like much ov a builder to me.~|~translationMissing
Okay. Come to me kitted out like a builder - hard hat, some boots, scruffy trousers and shirt - and I'll let ya try out ta be one ov us.~|~translationMissing
Count me in!~|~translationMissing
Say, that's a nice helmet.~|~translationMissing
'Black-eye'~|~translationMissing
Why, thanks.~|~translationMissing
I was just wondering if you might be able to help me out with one?~|~translationMissing
Always glad to help a budding builder.~|~translationMissing
But first, prove your Construction knowledge by answering some questions.~|~translationMissing
How many nails does it take to make a rocking chair?~|~translationMissing
One?~|~translationMissing
One? How do you suppose to use a single nail?~|~translationMissing
Five?~|~translationMissing
Nope. Keep guessing!~|~translationMissing
Three?~|~translationMissing
Bingo! Okay, now what takes 3 planks, 3 cloths and 3 nails to make, and helps remove light from a room?~|~translationMissing
Torn curtains~|~translationMissing
Torn curtains?~|~translationMissing
Nice one. Last question~|~translationMissing
I like fish and I want to put some in my garden, but I need a special water feature. What materials would I require?~|~translationMissing
8 clay pieces and 3 limestone bricks~|~translationMissing
8 clay pieces and 3 limestone bricks?~|~translationMissing
Oh, and you were so close!~|~translationMissing
10 clay pieces~|~translationMissing
10 clay pieces?~|~translationMissing
Greener pastures?~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Hard hat.)~|~translationMissing
Try the beckon emote while wearing an item of builders' clothing!~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute! Is there blood on this helmet?~|~translationMissing
Erm, no, that's just, erm, paint. Yes, paint! That's what it is!~|~translationMissing
Oh, okay. Thanks. Bye.~|~translationMissing
Ha, gullible fool.~|~translationMissing
10 limestone bricks~|~translationMissing
10 limestone bricks?~|~translationMissing
Guess again, mate.~|~translationMissing
A brown rug~|~translationMissing
A brown rug?~|~translationMissing
Of course, because that's what everyone needs - a rug up at their window.~|~translationMissing
Opulent curtains~|~translationMissing
Opulent curtains?~|~translationMissing
Those curtains are not going to be in any way opulent, matey.~|~translationMissing
Why, thanks. Some would say as nice as the one you're wearing!~|~translationMissing
Hi, I'm looking to get some kit to look like one of you guys.~|~translationMissing
Anything you might be able to help me out with?~|~translationMissing
'The Guns'~|~translationMissing
Well... Urmph! Ye can 'ave me shirt...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Has it been cleaned? I don't want some sweaty hand-me-down.~|~translationMissing
What? Huhmf! It ain't ever been...uurrgg...worn.~|~translationMissing
Well, that sounds good. Can I have it then?~|~translationMissing
Can't...hurrr...see why not. This is firsty work doh. Could do wiv a beer.~|~translationMissing
If player doesn't have a beer~|~translationMissing
Sure. What's your 'usual'?~|~translationMissing
I'm a simple...umph...man. I like the bar in Yanille and their cheap beer...~|~translationMissing
Simple, cheap beer. No problem.~|~translationMissing
Well, today's your lucky day!~|~translationMissing
Ahhh! Smashin...urrghh...deal!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Builder's shirt.)~|~translationMissing
What do you do when you're not lifting logs above your head?~|~translationMissing
In my free time?~|~translationMissing
All sorts. I like...hummff...a good kebab and a cold beer down...urrghh...the pub. And for those quiet evenings...hurrr...~|~translationMissing
A bit of needlepoint is always welcome.~|~translationMissing
I can honestly say you're a very original guy.~|~translationMissing
Why, hello there!~|~translationMissing
'Gummy'~|~translationMissing
Clothing.~|~translationMissing
Nope. Need mine.~|~translationMissing
Ah, come on. You know you want to give me free stuff.~|~translationMissing
Stop bothering me, can't you see I'm busy!~|~translationMissing
Yes, VERY busy I'm sure.~|~translationMissing
Okay, okay.~|~translationMissing
The other day I was drying my clothes on a line down by the shore. A storm hit and some of my clothing went missing.~|~translationMissing
Likely story. Sure you weren't skinny dipping?~|~translationMissing
Just go look and leave me be! Search around the tower and you may find them.~|~translationMissing
You search the plant...~|~translationMissing
If the plant has the trousers~|~translationMissing
Aha! You find some trousers!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Builder's trousers.)~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the trousers~|~translationMissing
Nope, nothing here.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I was just wondering... I don't suppose you have any spare clothing you could lend me?~|~translationMissing
'No fingers~|~translationMissing
' I do have many boots.~|~translationMissing
Ah, thanks.~|~translationMissing
' But there's no way I'm giving any to you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, but why? I could pay you!~|~translationMissing
' Nope. Only real builders can wear builders' boots, and you're not even close.~|~translationMissing
'No fingers'~|~translationMissing
Don't suppose you've seen any boots around here? Size nine, steel toed, brown leather...~|~translationMissing
Nope, not at all. I'd best be going. Have a nice day. Bye!~|~translationMissing
You attempt to pick the man's pocket.~|~translationMissing
You pick the man's pocket...and find some boots!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Builder's boots.)~|~translationMissing
Hey, Bonafido.~|~translationMissing
Well, if it ain't the wannabe builder!~|~translationMissing
If not wearing the full outfit~|~translationMissing
What clothes do I need?~|~translationMissing
Ya don't seem to be able ta remember anyfin'... Dearie me.~|~translationMissing
Come back to me wearin' a hard hat, some scruffy trousers, a good top and some hard boots. Yow shud fand some around 'ere.~|~translationMissing
Like a builder frew and frew! Good job - now it's time to test your skills.~|~translationMissing
Okay, what do you want me to build?~|~translationMissing
Build?~|~translationMissing
Build? Hahaha, don't be a plonka!~|~translationMissing
It's not building skills that makes a true builder, you have to have the right mental attitude, yeah?~|~translationMissing
You've plenty of work to do, but you need a drink fast - what do you go for?~|~translationMissing
Orange juice~|~translationMissing
Orange juice.~|~translationMissing
What are you? A healthy builder? Of course, not juice!~|~translationMissing
Tea~|~translationMissing
Tea.~|~translationMissing
Bingo! Ain't nufin' betta.~|~translationMissing
Now, let's hear you whistle!~|~translationMissing
Do a little dance and whistle as loud as you can~|~translationMissing
Player performs the "dance" emote~|~translationMissing
You do a little dance and whistle as loud as you can.~|~translationMissing
What on Gielinor are you doing? Get out of my sight.~|~translationMissing
Whistle a pretty tune~|~translationMissing
You whistle a tune.~|~translationMissing
Player performs the "cheer" emote~|~translationMissing
You know, you have quite a talent there.~|~translationMissing
Why thank you. Do you think I have what it takes to become a famous whistler?~|~translationMissing
Whistle for attention~|~translationMissing
(Player performs "Beckon (enhanced)" emote)~|~translationMissing
You whistle for attention.~|~translationMissing
Wahey! Nice one. Next question.~|~translationMissing
What's a good sign that you need to replace your trousers?~|~translationMissing
Your legs are getting a bit cold~|~translationMissing
Your legs are getting a bit cold?~|~translationMissing
Exactamondo! Glad to see you are thinking like a builder.~|~translationMissing
I am?~|~translationMissing
Yes, obviously if your legs are cold, you lost your trousers altogether!~|~translationMissing
That's just what I was thinking.~|~translationMissing
Now the last question - what do you do if you cut your finger?~|~translationMissing
Cry~|~translationMissing
Cry.~|~translationMissing
When was the last time you saw a builder cry?~|~translationMissing
Carry on, it'll fix itself~|~translationMissing
Carry on, it'll fix itself.~|~translationMissing
Yep, that's the one!~|~translationMissing
Suppose it could get infected then, but that'll just impress the lads all the more.~|~translationMissing
Exactly, you're gettin the hang of this quickly!~|~translationMissing
Cosmic! I canna see no reason why ya can't go in t'tower now. But be careful, there be some precarious situations in there.~|~translationMissing
So, what's left to build?~|~translationMissing
Well, there's a pipe system, a pressure machine and a strange cage up at the top that needs finishing off. The alchemists couldn't explain what they were for.~|~translationMissing
Fetch a plaster and ointment~|~translationMissing
Fetch a plaster and ointment.~|~translationMissing
Look, [player name], let me give you a bit of advice. If you want to look weak, that's the best way to go.~|~translationMissing
They're ripped and full of holes~|~translationMissing
They're ripped and full of holes.~|~translationMissing
No, no, no. That's the only way they should be!~|~translationMissing
The colour is starting to fade~|~translationMissing
The colour is starting to fade?~|~translationMissing
Oh no, you're really not getting the hang of this are you?~|~translationMissing
Bottle of wine~|~translationMissing
Bottle of wine.~|~translationMissing
Ooh, get Mr Fancy Pants here and his posh wine! You're no builder.~|~translationMissing
Hi again Bonafido.~|~translationMissing
Hi, 'Kelsew the Builder'! Been into the tower yet?~|~translationMissing
Not yet, I'll go when I'm ready. I'm taking my time, may have a quick cup of tea first.~|~translationMissing
Hahaha.~|~translationMissing
Wow, this place looks special. Best I look around for something to fix.~|~translationMissing
Heya, Bona. I had a look at the building. There's some complex machinery in there! Going to cost someone.~|~translationMissing
Yep, told ya so. Any idea what those alchemists are up ta?~|~translationMissing
Well, I agree now they're up to something. The question is what...? I don't think we're going to find out much from the alchmists, though.~|~translationMissing
I shall see if I can't fix it up and see for myself what is going on. Should be able to get a good reward from them. But don't worry, I'll make sure your efforts don't go unpaid.~|~translationMissing
You're a star among builders, that ya are!~|~translationMissing
Hello again, Effigy. I've had a nose around the tower. There's a lot of work to do!~|~translationMissing
I know, I know. But think of how fantastical it will be when it is finished!~|~translationMissing
Why fantastical? What are all those pipes and machines in there? What are you trying to do?~|~translationMissing
Fantastic weather we're having today!~|~translationMissing
But what are the-~|~translationMissing
The sun is shining... The birds are singing...~|~translationMissing
Hey! Answer my question!~|~translationMissing
Hehe. Just fix the tower. You'll soon see.~|~translationMissing
You'd best pay me well for this.~|~translationMissing
I must say, the inside of the tower is really something to behold.~|~translationMissing
Why, thanks. You'll find various pieces of machinery to fix in there. You can no doubt find the materials in there, too.~|~translationMissing
Hi, Currency. Got any spare cash?~|~translationMissing
No, do you?~|~translationMissing
Afraid not. You?~|~translationMissing
I'm going to stop before this gets violent.~|~translationMissing
Failing to find materials~|~translationMissing
You didn't find anything that time.~|~translationMissing
(Player performs the "No" emote)~|~translationMissing
You found something!~|~translationMissing
(Player performs the "Yes" emote)~|~translationMissing
The machine appears unfinished. You're going to need some materials~|~translationMissing
4 coloured balls, 3 pieces of metal sheeting and 4 valve wheels.~|~translationMissing
If missing materials~|~translationMissing
You need [materials] to fix the machine.~|~translationMissing
Construct it?~|~translationMissing
(The player builds the machine.)~|~translationMissing
You built the machine! It still needs calibrating, though.~|~translationMissing
The pressure seems to be affected by holes in the pipes. Perhaps you can block them up with the balls.~|~translationMissing
(Pressure machine interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
(When blocking the leaks) Pipe [1-4]~|~translationMissing
The leak is blocked!~|~translationMissing
After filling all 4 pipes with water~|~translationMissing
The machine is working!~|~translationMissing
If this was the last part of the tower to fix~|~translationMissing
The tower should be in working order now! Best go and tell Effigy!~|~translationMissing
6 rivets, 4 metal pipes and 5 metal rings.~|~translationMissing
(Pipe machine interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
After connecting the pipes~|~translationMissing
The cage appears unfinished. You're going to need some materials~|~translationMissing
5 metal bars and 4 bottles of binding fluid.~|~translationMissing
(The player builds the cage.)~|~translationMissing
You built the cage!~|~translationMissing
Some of the bars need to be completed - you need to get the sizes correct, though.~|~translationMissing
(Cage interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
(Fixing any part of the cage) You fix the part of the cage!~|~translationMissing
After fully fixing the cage~|~translationMissing
It's complete!~|~translationMissing
The cage is complete!~|~translationMissing
I've fixed all the machinery.~|~translationMissing
Hurrah! Splendiferous!~|~translationMissing
Now listen, what does it all do? Why are you-~|~translationMissing
Hey, guys! It's finished!~|~translationMissing
At last! Our work is complete!~|~translationMissing
I can almost taste the riches!~|~translationMissing
To the top of the tower, fellow alchemists!~|~translationMissing
Wait! What about-~|~translationMissing
Why does nobody listen? Best if I follow them, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
I'm really getting annoyed with those alchemists.~|~translationMissing
Well, I completed the tower and I still have no idea what it does, and then as soon as I tell Effigy of my hard work, he doesn't say one word of thanks and legs it off into the tower!~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll be a rabbit in da eyes of a fox! Best ya chase after 'im then and get us our dosh! Don't you do a runner, now!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I'm not about to let Effigy get away with treating us builders like this!~|~translationMissing
What on Gielinor is...~|~translationMissing
It is time, my friends! The culmination of our work is complete!~|~translationMissing
Long time indeed!~|~translationMissing
Many hours we have worked!~|~translationMissing
A great many years of planning and preparation has brought us here, my fellow alchemists. Now we have... The Tower of Life! We can already create gold, we can already transform matter from one thing to~|~translationMissing
another, and now we have the ability to create life itself! We owe much to the power of Guthix, for without the life essence he left below ground, we would never have been able to bring this tower alive!~|~translationMissing
They're insane!~|~translationMissing
It begins! The first day of creation!~|~translationMissing
Marvellous!~|~translationMissing
How is this possible?~|~translationMissing
It's alive!~|~translationMissing
We did it. A Homunculus!~|~translationMissing
Homunculus~|~translationMissing
Nwwooo! Whyyy? Where meee? Glarrraaa.~|~translationMissing
It can talk! A real success.~|~translationMissing
Where me? Skin burn...arrgh...eyes hurt...let me go!~|~translationMissing
Excellent, it can feel! It's self-aware. This is really a great day.~|~translationMissing
Whyeee cage? Argh...please help me! Graaahhh!~|~translationMissing
This is terrible, you must do something!~|~translationMissing
I don't want a reward, just let it go. Can't you see it's in pain?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's just an experiment in alchemy.~|~translationMissing
The creature must be grateful for his creation.~|~translationMissing
You create hurt. Not fair, let me free!~|~translationMissing
Silence, creature!~|~translationMissing
Yes, be still and quit your moaning.~|~translationMissing
No, mean, nasty peoples.~|~translationMissing
Shut up, you pathetic being.~|~translationMissing
Arghh! Let me go!~|~translationMissing
Don't make us hurt you.~|~translationMissing
Stop this! Let it go!~|~translationMissing
So horrible beings. Daarrrr!~|~translationMissing
It's getting angry.~|~translationMissing
You should know your place, adventurer. This is no concern of yours now.~|~translationMissing
You should be satisfied and leave. Then we can begin our experiments.~|~translationMissing
Not wise.~|~translationMissing
Arghhh!~|~translationMissing
Get out of the tower before it's too late!~|~translationMissing
Run away!~|~translationMissing
Flee for your lives!~|~translationMissing
They've run away. I must go confront those alchemists downstairs.~|~translationMissing
You won't BELIEVE what I just saw!~|~translationMissing
What? What?~|~translationMissing
That tower is... a tower of life! I just witnessed with my very own eyes the creation of an homunculus!~|~translationMissing
A homanque-what?~|~translationMissing
Homunculus! They have found a way of creating life itself, but the creature they have made is not a happy being.~|~translationMissing
And our money?~|~translationMissing
Are you listening at all? This creature is very dangerous, it needs to be stopped! And fast!~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you've got the money sorted.~|~translationMissing
I can't believe what you guys have done.~|~translationMissing
Marvellous.~|~translationMissing
No. Scary!~|~translationMissing
That too.~|~translationMissing
That is one very sad creature.~|~translationMissing
Why am I suddenly glad that you're not responsible for sorting out this mess?~|~translationMissing
Effigy!~|~translationMissing
I know, I know. This is a truly dangerous creation, of all proportions.~|~translationMissing
I hope you learn from this.~|~translationMissing
I will, I will. Next time we'll use a stronger cage.~|~translationMissing
A bad joke.~|~translationMissing
I'll just ignore that. So, what about that Homunculus up there? You can't just leave it.~|~translationMissing
Maybe you could go have a talk with it?~|~translationMissing
Why me? You created it!~|~translationMissing
Pleeeaaase.~|~translationMissing
Pretty please with a cherry on top?~|~translationMissing
I'll make sure you're compensated. You won't be forgotten for this!~|~translationMissing
Why do I get the feeling I'm doomed to go face that creature on my own?~|~translationMissing
Good on you! I knew you would help us!~|~translationMissing
Oh well. They do say that experience teaches fools.~|~translationMissing
Hi, Effigy.~|~translationMissing
Have you spoken to our wondrously fabulous creation yet?~|~translationMissing
I haven't spoken to it at all. Give me a chance. And please stop your overuse of adjectives.~|~translationMissing
What a hideously, unforgiveable and insensitive combination of dialogue to supply to a friend!~|~translationMissing
I swear you'll get a knuckle sandwich sometime soon if you don't shut up.~|~translationMissing
Charming.~|~translationMissing
I'm off to talk to the Homunculus.~|~translationMissing
Rather you than me. Can't say you look like you'll make it out alive.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for the support. How about saying something encouraging.~|~translationMissing
I don't know. How about 'You can do it!' or 'That Homunculus is in for a surprise'.~|~translationMissing
So, you want me to lie?~|~translationMissing
Forget it.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm going to go chat with the Homunculus.~|~translationMissing
Very good.~|~translationMissing
Could you do us a favour?~|~translationMissing
Could you ask it a question?~|~translationMissing
Does it have any spare cash?~|~translationMissing
Let me think how I can phrase this...~|~translationMissing
Leeet mwwe free. Argyyghh.~|~translationMissing
It's okay, I'm here to help you.~|~translationMissing
Lieees. Grahhh~|~translationMissing
No, honest. I helped the alchemists, but I had no idea what their plans involved.~|~translationMissing
Arggh, so alchemist create me now I trapped for experiements. But still I confused.~|~translationMissing
About what?~|~translationMissing
Me see logic, feeeel magic. A mix of the two.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. A creature created of logic and magic.~|~translationMissing
Don't fear. I shall fix your mind!~|~translationMissing
No so sure it is easy to do. No one canna 'elp. Arghhh.~|~translationMissing
Watch me.~|~translationMissing
You must now make sense of the Homunculus's mind. Force him to either follow the line of logic or the line of magic.~|~translationMissing
You tell me that you're confused, so ask me some questions!~|~translationMissing
Ah, please...~|~translationMissing
Choosing any one of the three options will give three new options in the same order and change the Homunculus' sanity meter. They will eventually loop.~|~translationMissing
First set~|~translationMissing
How can I make fire appear at my fingertips?~|~translationMissing
Get some logs and a tinderbox.~|~translationMissing
With the aid of 5 fire runes.~|~translationMissing
That's impossible! No one can do that!~|~translationMissing
Second set~|~translationMissing
How do dragons breathe fire?~|~translationMissing
Not too sure, I've never seen it happen.~|~translationMissing
With the help of the magical dragonstones!~|~translationMissing
By ignition of gas in their belly as they exhale.~|~translationMissing
Fourth set~|~translationMissing
What do people do, day-in, day-out?~|~translationMissing
Runecraft, enchant jewellery, perform alchemy.~|~translationMissing
Eat, sleep, nothing that exciting.~|~translationMissing
Fletching, Crafting, Smithing.~|~translationMissing
Fifth set~|~translationMissing
What could I do with unwanted bones?~|~translationMissing
Bury them.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to think you wouldn't be carrying bones around.~|~translationMissing
Turn them into bananas or peaches!~|~translationMissing
Sixth set~|~translationMissing
What's the best way to travel?~|~translationMissing
I'm not really much of a traveller, sorry.~|~translationMissing
Run, run as fast as you can.~|~translationMissing
Depends where you are headed, but teleport spells are a safe bet.~|~translationMissing
Seventh set~|~translationMissing
I hear people whisper of potions...~|~translationMissing
Yes, you can make magic potions to boost your skills.~|~translationMissing
People mix together ingredients in vials. The nutrients will help you.~|~translationMissing
Yes, liquid-filled vials. Big deal.~|~translationMissing
Eighth set~|~translationMissing
How are runes created?~|~translationMissing
By harnessing the power of the gods!~|~translationMissing
Never seen one personally.~|~translationMissing
Take some essence to an altar and use a talisman.~|~translationMissing
Ninth set~|~translationMissing
Can people move things with the power of the mind?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps. I've never seen it myself, though.~|~translationMissing
Yep, you can use the Telekinetic Grab spell.~|~translationMissing
Sure. Use your brain to tell someone to move it!~|~translationMissing
Tenth set~|~translationMissing
How can I possibly exist?~|~translationMissing
Through the power of alchemy.~|~translationMissing
It's beyond me!~|~translationMissing
It's a simple case of combining materials.~|~translationMissing
Eleventh set~|~translationMissing
Explain those flashing sparks that scared the alchemists.~|~translationMissing
You have special powers - no surprise seeing how you were created.~|~translationMissing
Coincidence - there is a lot of loose metal around.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, they were cool! Nice one.~|~translationMissing
Twelfth set~|~translationMissing
I want to learn more - what should I study?~|~translationMissing
Try some Mining followed by Smithing.~|~translationMissing
How about Magic and Runecrafting?~|~translationMissing
Thirteenth set~|~translationMissing
If I can reach out far enough I can grab the sun.~|~translationMissing
Don't be silly! You'd get burnt!~|~translationMissing
Can't see why not, anything is possible.~|~translationMissing
Well the sun is not actually there, it's where it used to be!~|~translationMissing
Fourteenth set~|~translationMissing
Am I a creature of magic or a creature of logic?~|~translationMissing
Everything has a reason, even if you don't know what it is.~|~translationMissing
Probably a bit of both.~|~translationMissing
Your very existense speaks of mystical forces.~|~translationMissing
Fifteenth set~|~translationMissing
Which do you believe in?~|~translationMissing
Magic.~|~translationMissing
I'm too laid back to really care, mate.~|~translationMissing
Logic.~|~translationMissing
When the Homunculus' mind is fixed~|~translationMissing
That it! Make sense now, thank you!~|~translationMissing
I decided to root for magic.~|~translationMissing
No does matter which you chose. Me needed organise my thoughts. I see there is truth in both.~|~translationMissing
Now we go scare alchemies - they have been wrong to do this! Although I have life, they mustn't go about this again.~|~translationMissing
Sounds like a good plan. Can you get out of that cage?~|~translationMissing
Easy. You run down and I watching from here. I surprise right moment.~|~translationMissing
It's me again, Homunculus.~|~translationMissing
Do you remember?~|~translationMissing
Stranger... nooo, help meee.~|~translationMissing
Stay calm, let's do this.~|~translationMissing
Better. You been mine angel. I now have the understanding I need.~|~translationMissing
Please, alchemists you speak, me appear to surprise.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure I understand, but okay, I will go have a word with them.~|~translationMissing
Hi, Bonafido.~|~translationMissing
Hi. How's the tower?~|~translationMissing
Finished, really.~|~translationMissing
Looks like we're out of a job then.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. There are frequently new buildings required around Gielinor. I'm sure your services will be called upon again.~|~translationMissing
Well, I've sat down and had a good chat with the Homunculus.~|~translationMissing
You'll soon find out!~|~translationMissing
The Homunculus is a bit better off now.~|~translationMissing
Excellent. So we can go back in.~|~translationMissing
Effigy, I need a word with you.~|~translationMissing
You've killed it?~|~translationMissing
Not quite...~|~translationMissing
Boo.~|~translationMissing
Oh no, look!~|~translationMissing
Arrghhh! Have mercy!~|~translationMissing
You set it free. Oh, please don't hurt me!~|~translationMissing
Me not hurt. Now tell. What you plans? What you do with me?~|~translationMissing
Please, we just wanted to experiment. We wanted to create life. There's a dungeon under the tower. Long ago we found a strange source of energy that we believe was left behind by the great Guthix. He used to~|~translationMissing
create life with such ease. We realised we should be able to use this powerful substance, but we needed to bring together our magic along with the logical construction of the builders. It seemed through our experiments that~|~translationMissing
even magic needs a certain level of rules and laws to work.~|~translationMissing
Bad play with. Naughty men. Go! Go, never return!~|~translationMissing
Right away, right away!~|~translationMissing
Me look dungeon, [player name]. Please meet there.~|~translationMissing
This place is bizarre!~|~translationMissing
Me do know. Pleased you rescue.~|~translationMissing
My pleasure. So what is this place?~|~translationMissing
They use essence of Guthix power. Create tower pump this from ground. Make me with godly power. Dangerous.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, but you're okay now. You have this place to reside in.~|~translationMissing
Thrank you. For reward you speak me, I makes monsters.~|~translationMissing

8 Return of the orb~|~translationMissing
Well hello stranger. My name's Bolren, I'm the king of the tree gnomes.~|~translationMissing
I'm surprised you made it in, maybe I made the maze too easy.~|~translationMissing
Maybe.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I have more serious concerns at the moment. Very serious.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you asked.~|~translationMissing
The truth is my people are in grave danger. We have always been protected by the Spirit Tree. No creature of dark can harm us while its three orbs are in place.~|~translationMissing
We are not a violent race, but we fight when we must. Many gnomes have fallen battling the dark forces of Khazard to the North.~|~translationMissing
We became desperate, so we took one orb of protection to the battlefield. It was a foolish move.~|~translationMissing
Khazard troops seized the orb. Now we are completely defenceless.~|~translationMissing
You would be a huge benefit on the battlefield. If you would go there and try to retrieve the orb, my people and I will be forever grateful.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry but I won't be involved.~|~translationMissing
Ok then, travel safe.~|~translationMissing
I would be glad to help.~|~translationMissing
Thank you. The battlefield is to the north of the maze. Commander Montai will inform you of their current situation.~|~translationMissing
That is if he's still alive.~|~translationMissing
My assistant shall guide you out. Good luck friend, try your best to return the orb~|~translationMissing
Elkoy guides you out of the maze.~|~translationMissing
Elkoy~|~translationMissing
We're out of the maze now. Please hurry, we must have the orb if we are to survive.~|~translationMissing
I'll leave you to it then.~|~translationMissing
Ok, take care.~|~translationMissing
Commander Montai~|~translationMissing
Hello traveller, are you here to help or just to watch?~|~translationMissing
I've been sent by King Bolren to retrieve the orb of protection.~|~translationMissing
Excellent we need all the help we can get.~|~translationMissing
I'm commander Montai. The orb is in the Khazard stronghold to the north, but until we weaken their defences we can't get close.~|~translationMissing
Firstly we need to strengthen our own defences. We desperately need wood to make more battlements, once the battlements are gone it's all over. Six loads of normal logs should do it.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I no longer want to be involved.~|~translationMissing
Sorry I no longer want to be involved.~|~translationMissing
That's a shame, we could have done with your help.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll gather some wood.~|~translationMissing
Please be as quick as you can, I don't know how much longer we can hold out.~|~translationMissing
Hello again, we're still desperate for wood soldier.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 6 logs in their inventory~|~translationMissing
If the player has 6 logs in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I have some here. (You give six loads of logs to the commander.)~|~translationMissing
That's excellent, now we can make more defensive battlements.? Give me a moment to organise the troops and then come speak to me. I'll inform you of our next phase of attack.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing Montai?~|~translationMissing
We're hanging in there soldier. For the next phase of our attack we need to breach their stronghold.~|~translationMissing
The ballista can break through the stronghold wall, and then we can advance and seize back the orb.~|~translationMissing
From this distance we can't get an accurate enough shot.? We need the correct coordinates of the stronghold for a direct hit.? I've sent out three tracker gnomes to gather them.~|~translationMissing
Have they returned?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, and we're running out of time. I need you to go into the heart of the battlefield, find the trackers, and bring back the coordinates.~|~translationMissing
Do you think you can do it?~|~translationMissing
No, I've had enough of your battle.~|~translationMissing
I understand, this isn't your fight.~|~translationMissing
I'll try my best.~|~translationMissing
Thank you, you're braver than most.~|~translationMissing
I don't know how long I will be able to hold out. Once you have the coordinates come back and fire the ballista right into those monsters.~|~translationMissing
If you can retrieve the orb and bring safety back to my people, none of the blood spilled on this field will be in vain.~|~translationMissing
Do you know the coordinates of the Khazard stronghold?~|~translationMissing
Tracker gnome 1~|~translationMissing
I managed to get one, although it wasn't easy.~|~translationMissing
Well done.~|~translationMissing
The other two tracker gnomes should have the other coordinates if they're still alive.~|~translationMissing
OK, take care.~|~translationMissing
Tracker gnome 2~|~translationMissing
They caught me spying on the stronghold. They beat and tortured me.~|~translationMissing
But I didn't crack. I told them nothing. They can't break me!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry little man.~|~translationMissing
Don't be. I have the position of the stronghold!~|~translationMissing
Now leave before they find you and all is lost.~|~translationMissing
Hang in there.~|~translationMissing
Go!~|~translationMissing
Tracker gnome 3~|~translationMissing
OK? Who's OK? Not me! Hee hee!~|~translationMissing
You can't see me, no one can. Monsters, demons, they're all around me!~|~translationMissing
They're dancing, all of them, hee hee.~|~translationMissing
Do you have the coordinate for the Khazard stronghold?~|~translationMissing
Who holds the stronghold?~|~translationMissing
My legs and your legs, ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
You're mad.~|~translationMissing
Dance with me, and Khazard's men are beat.~|~translationMissing
I'll pray for you little man.~|~translationMissing
All day we pray in the hay, hee hee.~|~translationMissing
Hello warrior. We need the coordinates for a direct hit from the ballista. Once you have a direct hit you will be able to enter the stronghold and retrieve the orb.~|~translationMissing
That tracker gnome was a bit vague about the x coordinate! What could it be?~|~translationMissing
0001~|~translationMissing
0002~|~translationMissing
0003~|~translationMissing
0004~|~translationMissing
You enter the height and y coordinates you got from the tracker gnomes.~|~translationMissing
If the player chooses the wrong coordinate~|~translationMissing
The huge spear completely misses the Khazard stronghold!~|~translationMissing
Evidently that wasn't the right x coordinate.~|~translationMissing
If the player chooses the correct coordinate~|~translationMissing
The huge spear flies through the air and screams down directly into the Khazard stronghold. A deafening crash echoes over the battlefield as the front entrance is reduced to rubble.~|~translationMissing
The Khazard stronghold has already been breached.~|~translationMissing
I've breached the stronghold.~|~translationMissing
I saw, that was a beautiful sight. The Khazard troops didn't know what hit them.~|~translationMissing
Now is the time to retrieve the orb. It's all in your hands. I'll be praying for you.~|~translationMissing
The wall has been reduced to rubble. It should be possible to climb over the remains...~|~translationMissing
Khazard commander~|~translationMissing
Don't even think of taking the orb!~|~translationMissing
You search the chest. Inside you find gnomes' stolen orb of protection.~|~translationMissing
Oi! You! Get out of there.~|~translationMissing
I have the orb of protection.~|~translationMissing
Incredible, for a human you really are something.~|~translationMissing
Thanks... I think!~|~translationMissing
I'll stay here with my troops and try and hold Khazard's men back. You return the orb to the gnome village. Go as quick as you can, the village is still unprotected.~|~translationMissing
Hello Elkoy.~|~translationMissing
You're back! And the orb?~|~translationMissing
You're our saviour. Please return it to the village and we are all saved. Would you like me to show you the way to the village?~|~translationMissing
Elkoy guides you through the maze.~|~translationMissing
Here we are. Take the orb to King Bolren, I'm sure he'll be pleased to see you.~|~translationMissing
No thanks Elkoy.~|~translationMissing
Please, we must have the orb if we are to survive.~|~translationMissing
I have the orb.~|~translationMissing
Oh my... The misery, the horror!~|~translationMissing
King Bolren, are you OK?~|~translationMissing
Thank you traveller, but it's too late. We're all doomed.~|~translationMissing
They came in the night. I don't know how many, but enough.~|~translationMissing
Khazard troops. They slaughtered anyone who got in their way. Women, children, my wife.~|~translationMissing
They took the other orbs, now we are defenceless.~|~translationMissing
Where did they take them?~|~translationMissing
They headed north of the stronghold. A warlord carries the orbs.~|~translationMissing
I will find the warlord and bring back the orbs.~|~translationMissing
You are brave, but this task will be tough even for you. I wish you the best of luck. Once again you are our only hope.~|~translationMissing
I will safeguard this orb and pray for your safe return. My assistant will guide you out.~|~translationMissing
Good luck friend.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry but I can't help~|~translationMissing
I understand, this isn't your battle.~|~translationMissing
You there, stop!~|~translationMissing
Khazard warlord~|~translationMissing
Go back to your pesky little green friends.~|~translationMissing
I've come for the orbs.~|~translationMissing
You're out of your depth traveller. These orbs are part of a much larger picture.~|~translationMissing
They're stolen goods, now give them here!~|~translationMissing
Ha, you really think you stand a chance? I'll crush you.~|~translationMissing
Bah, enough of you!~|~translationMissing
As the warlord falls to the ground, a ghostly vapour floats upwards from his battle-worn armour. Out of sight you hear a shrill scream in the still air. You spot the orbs of protection among his remains.~|~translationMissing
You truly are a hero.~|~translationMissing
You saved us by returning the orbs of protection. I'm humbled and wish you well.~|~translationMissing
Would you like me to show you the way to the village?~|~translationMissing
Here we are. Feel free to have a look around.~|~translationMissing
Ok then, take care.~|~translationMissing
Bolren, I have returned.~|~translationMissing
You made it back! Do you have the orbs?~|~translationMissing
I have them here.~|~translationMissing
Hooray, you're amazing. I didn't think it was possible but you've saved us.~|~translationMissing
Once the orbs are replaced we will be safe once more. We must begin the ceremony immediately.~|~translationMissing
What does the ceremony involve?~|~translationMissing
The spirit tree has looked over us for centuries. Now we must pay our respects.~|~translationMissing
The orbs appear above the spirit tree, while the local gnomes alternate paying their respects.~|~translationMissing
[Northern Local Gnomes]~|~translationMissing
Su tana.~|~translationMissing
[Southern Local Gnomes]~|~translationMissing
En tania.~|~translationMissing
The orbs of protection come to rest gently in the branches of the ancient spirit tree.~|~translationMissing
Now at last my people are safe once more. We can live in peace again.~|~translationMissing
I'm pleased I could help.~|~translationMissing
You are modest brave traveller.~|~translationMissing
Please, for your efforts take this amulet. It's made from the same sacred stone as the orbs of protection. It will help keep you safe on your journeys.~|~translationMissing
Thank you King Bolren.~|~translationMissing
The tree has many other powers, some of which I cannot reveal. As a friend of the gnome people, I can now allow you to use the tree's magic to teleport to other trees grown from related seeds.~|~translationMissing

Kangai Mau~|~translationMissing
Hello. I Kangai Mau of the Rantuki tribe.~|~translationMissing
And what are you doing in Brimhaven?~|~translationMissing
I looking for someone brave to go on important mission for me. Someone skilled in thievery and sneaking about. I am told I can find such people in Brimhaven.~|~translationMissing
Tell me of this mission.~|~translationMissing
I need someone to go on a mission to the city of Ardougne. There you will find the house of Lord Handelmort. In his house he has our tribal totem.~|~translationMissing
We need it back.~|~translationMissing
Why does he have it?~|~translationMissing
Lord Handelmort is an Ardougnese explorer which means he think he have the right to come to my tribal home, steal our stuff and put in his private museum.~|~translationMissing
Start The Tribal Totem quest?~|~translationMissing
Ok, I will get it back.~|~translationMissing
Best of luck with that adventurer.~|~translationMissing
How can I find Handelmort's house? Ardougne is a big place...~|~translationMissing
I don't know Ardougne. You tell me.~|~translationMissing
Let's hope I find some help soon.~|~translationMissing
I'm in search of adventure!~|~translationMissing
Adventure is something I may be able to give.~|~translationMissing
Who are the Rantuki tribe?~|~translationMissing
A proud and noble tribe of Karamja. But now we are few, as men come from across sea, steal our land, and settle on our hunting grounds.~|~translationMissing
This door is securely locked.~|~translationMissing
Horacio~|~translationMissing
It's a fine day to be out in the garden isn't it?~|~translationMissing
Yes, it's very nice.~|~translationMissing
Days like these make me glad to be alive!~|~translationMissing
So... who are you?~|~translationMissing
My name is Horacio Dobson. I'm the gardener to Lord Handelmort. Take a look around this beautiful garden, all of this is my handiwork.~|~translationMissing
So... do you garden round the back too?~|~translationMissing
That I do!~|~translationMissing
Doesn't all of the security around the house get in your way then?~|~translationMissing
Ah, I'm used to all that. I have my keys, the guard dogs know me, and I know the combination to the door lock. It's rather easy, it's his middle name.~|~translationMissing
Whose middle name?~|~translationMissing
Hum. I probably shouldn't have said that. Forget I mentioned it.~|~translationMissing
Trying to muscle in on my job eh? I'm more than happy to do this all by myself!~|~translationMissing
GPDT employee~|~translationMissing
Welcome to GPDT!~|~translationMissing
Senior Patents Clerk, Chamber of Invention, The Wizards' Tower, Misthalin. The crate is securely fastened shut and ready for delivery.~|~translationMissing
There is a label on this crate. It says~|~translationMissing
Lord Handelmort, Handelmort Mansion, Ardougne You carefully peel it off and take it.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Address label.)~|~translationMissing
You can see the gluey outline from where you peeled the address label off.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. My name is Cromperty. I am a Wizard, and an inventor.~|~translationMissing
So what have you invented?~|~translationMissing
Ah! My latest invention is my patent pending teleportation block! It emits a low level magical signal, that will allow me to locate it anywhere in the world, and teleport anything~|~translationMissing
directly to it! I hope to revolutionise the entire teleportation system! Don't you think I'm great? Uh, I mean it's great?~|~translationMissing
So where is the other block?~|~translationMissing
Well... Hmm. I would guess somewhere between here and the Wizards' Tower in Misthalin. All I know is that it hasn't got there yet as the wizards there would have contacted me.~|~translationMissing
I'm using the GPDT for delivery. They assured me it would be delivered promptly.~|~translationMissing
Can I be teleported please?~|~translationMissing
Who are the GPDT?~|~translationMissing
The Gielinor Parcel Delivery Team. They come very highly recommended. Their motto is~|~translationMissing
'We aim to deliver your stuff at some point after you have paid us!'~|~translationMissing
By all means! I'm afraid I can't give you any specifics as to where you will come out however. Presumably wherever the other block is located.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that sounds good. Teleport me!~|~translationMissing
Okey dokey! Ready?~|~translationMissing
Dipsolum sententa sententi!~|~translationMissing
(The player gets teleported to the GDPT Depot.)~|~translationMissing
That sounds dangerous. Leave me here.~|~translationMissing
Well done, that's very clever.~|~translationMissing
Yes it is isn't it? Forgive me for feeling a little smug, this is a major breakthrough in the field of teleportation!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Can you teleport me to the Rune Essence?~|~translationMissing
You carefully place the delivery address label over the existing label, covering it completely.~|~translationMissing
Now I just need someone to deliver it for me.~|~translationMissing
You have already replaced the delivery address label.~|~translationMissing
To Lord Handelmort, Handelmort Mansion, Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
So, when are you going to deliver this crate?~|~translationMissing
Well... I guess we could do it now...~|~translationMissing
Thank you, it's interesting in here.~|~translationMissing
We're the premier delivery service in ALL of Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
If the combination is wrong~|~translationMissing
This combination is incorrect.~|~translationMissing
If the combination is correct~|~translationMissing
The combination seems correct!~|~translationMissing
As you climb the stairs you hear a click...~|~translationMissing
You have fallen through a trap!~|~translationMissing
Your trained senses as a thief enable you to see that there is a trap in these stairs. You make a note of its location for future reference when using these stairs.~|~translationMissing
You climb the stairs.~|~translationMissing
Inside the chest you find the tribal totem.~|~translationMissing
Have you got our totem back?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the totem in their inventory~|~translationMissing
No, it's not that easy.~|~translationMissing
Bah, you no good.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the totem in their inventory~|~translationMissing
You have??? Many thanks brave adventurer! Here, have some freshly cooked Karamjan fish, caught specially by my tribe.~|~translationMissing

O-oh, he seems cheesed off...~|~translationMissing
Aga~|~translationMissing
What man-thing want?~|~translationMissing
Errr... I've got to go.~|~translationMissing
Ug~|~translationMissing
Arrrghhh, die man-thing!~|~translationMissing
Ahhh, it no use, I too sad!~|~translationMissing
Awww, you poor troll. What seems to be the problem?~|~translationMissing
I love Aga, she so beautiful, she smell so nice, like rotting dead ice wolf!~|~translationMissing
But Arrg that... arrrrrg! He together with Aga and he much stronger than Ug. He rip Ug apart!~|~translationMissing
Who is Aga?~|~translationMissing
She most beautiful troll in world.~|~translationMissing
Ug want to marry Aga, but she with Arrg!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry now, I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
You help Ug? You nice, maybe Ug not eat you!~|~translationMissing
Errrr... thanks... I think?~|~translationMissing
I will go and talk to Aga.~|~translationMissing
A crying troll who's in love?! This just gets better and better!~|~translationMissing
Hahahahaha... a crying Troll~|~translationMissing
Hahahahaha... a crying Troll.~|~translationMissing
I bet all the other trolls laugh at you!~|~translationMissing
Go away, man-thing, leave Ug alone!~|~translationMissing
Hahahahaa!~|~translationMissing
What you want, man-thing?~|~translationMissing
Well... you're big and hairy?~|~translationMissing
Thanks, me very careful about looks!~|~translationMissing
So... how's your... um... love life?~|~translationMissing
(I can't believe I am asking a troll about her love life!!)~|~translationMissing
It ok, I with Arrg, he very strong and mighty but sometimes...~|~translationMissing
I not know if he love Aga, He say he will show he love by bringing me flower Trollweiss.~|~translationMissing
It a very rare, beautiful flower, it very special!~|~translationMissing
It grow somewhere in these mountains.~|~translationMissing
(Maybe trolls DO have a romantic streak!)~|~translationMissing
And Arrg said he would get you the flower?~|~translationMissing
He very strong, if he love Aga he will get Trollweiss.~|~translationMissing
So... what do you think about Ug?~|~translationMissing
You know that wimpy, crying... nevermind.~|~translationMissing
Aga can't wait for Trollweiss. Arrg will show his love!~|~translationMissing
Well, got to go... see you.~|~translationMissing
Whaaaaaaaat?~|~translationMissing
Ehh, Excuse me... Mr. Troll, sir,~|~translationMissing
How did you grow so big and strong?~|~translationMissing
Get away from Arrg, puny man-maggot. Or you lunch!~|~translationMissing
Your girlfriend said you know where to find Trollweiss?~|~translationMissing
Girlfriend? Which one?~|~translationMissing
Errr... Aga.~|~translationMissing
Yes, she good cook and wash but talk too many. Arrg strong troll, Arrg mighty troll, Arrg have many girlfriends!~|~translationMissing
(What a jerk!)~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, you're great, but what about the Trollweiss?~|~translationMissing
I no know, I just say to make Aga shut up!~|~translationMissing
So you don't actually know where to find the Trollweiss?~|~translationMissing
Great...~|~translationMissing
I've got to go.~|~translationMissing
'~|~translationMissing
You talk to Aga yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, she said that she really wants a certain flower! Trollweiss, I think she called it.~|~translationMissing
Oh no! Then Ug no chance, Trollweiss not found in years!~|~translationMissing
Don't worry I'll find it for you!~|~translationMissing
You no chance, Ug no chance, need someone who live whole life in mountains. Ug no know anyone like that...~|~translationMissing
Hang on a sec...~|~translationMissing
Have you got flowers yet?~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'm still looking.~|~translationMissing
Standard dialogue options~|~translationMissing
Do you know where I can find Trollweiss?~|~translationMissing
It has been a long time since someone has asked me about Trollweiss.~|~translationMissing
In the old days Trollweiss could be found all over the mountains, but recently it has been disappearing!~|~translationMissing
There is one place, where I am sure it still grows, but it is impossible to get to.~|~translationMissing
Nothing's impossible, if you put your mind to it!~|~translationMissing
Ahhh, the youth of today. So sure of their prowess. But who am I to stop you from walking into your doom, if that is what you wish to do!~|~translationMissing
Spare me with the lectures and tell me where to find this flower!~|~translationMissing
Well, you will need to enter the domain of the ice trolls! This is an area full of wicked beasts and biting cold. From there you will find a way down a slope to a plateau where the Trollweiss grows.~|~translationMissing
It used to be easy to get to this plateau, but it is now snowed over and virtually inaccessible. That's global warming for you!~|~translationMissing
There must be a way to get there.~|~translationMissing
There is maybe one thing...~|~translationMissing
If you could make some sort of sled, you could probably get down there but I don't know where that would lead you, as you will not be able to go up the mountain again.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound like a very good idea to me!~|~translationMissing
Pah, who are you to talk? Without me you would never have found the secret path to the plateau!!~|~translationMissing
What would I need to make such a sled?~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm no expert. Maybe you should speak to someone who knows more about such technical stuff.~|~translationMissing
Like who?~|~translationMissing
Why don't you ask Dunstan. He's always helped me with my spiked boots.~|~translationMissing
Thank you very much for the information.~|~translationMissing
See you later~|~translationMissing
Talk about a quest.~|~translationMissing
Standard dialogue~|~translationMissing
Hi! Did you want something?~|~translationMissing
Can you put some spikes on my Climbing boots?~|~translationMissing
Is it OK if I use your anvil?~|~translationMissing
I need a sled!!~|~translationMissing
Haha, very funny! Aren't you a bit old for rolling around in the snow?~|~translationMissing
So why do you need a sled then?~|~translationMissing
I need the sled to get to a certain location in the mountains.~|~translationMissing
Hahahaha.~|~translationMissing
No, I actually still like rolling around in the snow.~|~translationMissing
Well, I guess some of us never grow up!~|~translationMissing
Well, since you've helped my family out a couple of times, I'd be glad to build a sled for you.~|~translationMissing
Let me think...~|~translationMissing
Yeah, that should do it. I will need some yew or maple logs, a bar of iron and some rope.~|~translationMissing
I should have my designs ready by the time you have brought me all the materials~|~translationMissing
Have you got all the materials for the sled yet?~|~translationMissing
No, I haven't got everything yet.~|~translationMissing
Well, unfortunately I can't make the sled without all the materials.~|~translationMissing
Continue to standard dialogue options~|~translationMissing
Yes, I have all the materials for the sled.~|~translationMissing
Dunstan takes the materials and some of his tools and starts making a sled. After a while Dunstan hands you a finished sled.~|~translationMissing
Well, here's the sled but it will need to be waxed. The wax will need to both protect the sled as well as smoothen it.~|~translationMissing
Maybe if you mix some wax with a bit of swamp tar it will achieve the desired effect. You'll also need something to store the wax in... like a cake tin.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get wax from?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. I'm a smith! But maybe you should look for some bees.~|~translationMissing
Where can I get swamp tar from?~|~translationMissing
The swamp of course! It's south of Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
What else do I need?~|~translationMissing
You will also need a cake tin to store the wax in.~|~translationMissing
See you!~|~translationMissing
Thank you, come again.~|~translationMissing
Have you got flower yet?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I've got it right here.~|~translationMissing
Thanks man-thing. Ug so happy!~|~translationMissing
But me too scared to give Trollweiss to Aga because Arrg will eat Ug for breakfast.~|~translationMissing
What? So I have to get rid of Arrg as well? After all this trouble I should be the one getting the girl...~|~translationMissing
Then again maybe not.~|~translationMissing
You no touch Aga. Ug kill you.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll tell Arrg you said that. Shall I tell him to meet you here?~|~translationMissing
No, no, no, wait! Ug just joke, oh great man-legend. Ug puny, you strong.~|~translationMissing
I suppose I am a bit of a legend. Ok I'll do it!~|~translationMissing
You defeat Arrg yet?~|~translationMissing
No, not yet. Something like this requires careful planning.~|~translationMissing
I am here to kill you!~|~translationMissing
Very good, Arrg was getting hungry.~|~translationMissing
But not in front of the lady, let's take it outside.~|~translationMissing
The fight begins~|~translationMissing
Aga deserves better than you.~|~translationMissing
What you mean? Arrg strong troll, Arrg mighty troll. Every troll woman want Arrg.~|~translationMissing
But you don't love her!~|~translationMissing
This concept of 'love' confuses and infuriates Arrg.~|~translationMissing
Looks like I'm going to have to teach you a lesson in 'love'.~|~translationMissing
Oh mighty man-warrior, please no hurt Arrg.~|~translationMissing
Yes, he has been defeated.~|~translationMissing
You very strong and nice. Take pretty rocks as thanks.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, Ug. So, now you can go and speak to Aga!~|~translationMissing
I too scared.~|~translationMissing
Has anyone ever told you that you are a useless troll? My grandmother has more guts than you and she doesn't even have her teeth anymore!~|~translationMissing
Whaaat? Man-thing want to die? Ug no scared of you or your grandmother! Ug show you. Ug go to Aga now.~|~translationMissing
How did it go with Aga?~|~translationMissing
I give Trollweiss to Aga and she say it taste very nice. She very happy and we together now.~|~translationMissing
What?! I went through all that trouble to get a snack for a hungry troll?~|~translationMissing
Thank you many for getting Ug together with Aga. We much happy together! I so happy I can't stop crying!~|~translationMissing
Thanks for getting Aga and Ug happy. Without you Ug too shy, Aga so in love with Ug!~|~translationMissing

Please please help us, bold adventurer!~|~translationMissing
Our little village has been dreadfully ravaged by an evil vampyre! He lives in the basement of the manor to the north, we need someone to get rid of him once and for all!~|~translationMissing
Start the Vampyre Slayer quest?~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm up for an adventure.~|~translationMissing
I think first you should seek help. I have a friend who is a retired vampyre hunter, his name is Dr. Harlow. He may be able to give you some tips. He can normally be found in the Blue Moon Inn in Varrock, he's a bit~|~translationMissing
of an old soak these days. Mention his old friend Morgan, I'm sure he wouldn't want me killed by a vampyre.~|~translationMissing
I'll look him up then.~|~translationMissing
No, vampyres are scary!~|~translationMissing
I don't blame you.~|~translationMissing
How are you doing with the quest?~|~translationMissing
Please hurry! Every day we live in fear that we will be the vampyre's next victim!~|~translationMissing
Dr Harlow~|~translationMissing
Buy me a drrink pleassh...~|~translationMissing
No, you've had enough.~|~translationMissing
Morgan needs your help!~|~translationMissing
Morgan you shhay..?~|~translationMissing
His village is being terrorised by a vampyre! He told me to ask you about how I can stop it.~|~translationMissing
Buy me a beer... then I'll teash you what you need to know...~|~translationMissing
But this is your friend Morgan we're talking about!~|~translationMissing
Buy ush a drink anyway...~|~translationMissing
If the player isn't carrying a beer~|~translationMissing
I'll just go and buy one.~|~translationMissing
If the player is carrying a beer~|~translationMissing
You give a beer to Dr Harlow.~|~translationMissing
Cheersh matey...~|~translationMissing
So tell me how to kill vampyres then.~|~translationMissing
Yesh Yesh vampyres, I was very good at killing em once...~|~translationMissing
Dr Harlow appears to sober up slightly.~|~translationMissing
If the stake is in the player's inventory~|~translationMissing
Don't forget to take your stake with you, otherwise he'll just regenerate. Yes, you must have a stake to finish it off... I'd give you a stake but you've got one in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
If the stake is in the player's bank~|~translationMissing
Don't forget to take your stake with you, otherwise he'll just regenerate. Yes, you must have a stake to finish it off... I'd give you a stake but you've already got one stored somewhere.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have a stake~|~translationMissing
Well, you're going to need a stake, otherwise he'll just regenerate. Yes, you must have a stake to finish it off... I just happen to have one with me.~|~translationMissing
Dr Harlow hands you a stake.~|~translationMissing
You'll need a hammer as well, to drive it in properly, your everyday general store hammer will do. One last thing... It's wise to carry garlic with you, vampyres are somewhat weakened if they can smell garlic. Morgan~|~translationMissing
always liked garlic, you should try his house. But remember, a vampyre is still a dangerous foe!~|~translationMissing
The vampyre seems to weaken.~|~translationMissing

What ho, [sirrah/milady]. Jolly good show on the old training grounds thingy, what?~|~translationMissing
Do you have any jobs for me yet?~|~translationMissing
So Tiffy, now that I'm a Temple Knight Initiate do you have any jobs for me to do?~|~translationMissing
Do you have any quests for a hard-working adventurer?~|~translationMissing
Well old [boy/gal], looking at the old dossier we have on you here there seems to be a tiny problem, what?~|~translationMissing
Problem? What problem?Er...and you have a dossier on me???~|~translationMissing
Well OF COURSE we have a dossier on you!We have a dossier on EVERYONE!It's our job, dontchaknow!~|~translationMissing
Um... okay...So what's the problem?~|~translationMissing
Well now, seems we made a tiny blunder when we first contacted you to join the Temple Knights, what?~|~translationMissing
Entirely our own fault, could have been avoided and all that, but a bit of a show-stopper, what?~|~translationMissing
Well [lad/lass], here's the thing~|~translationMissing
Only members of the White Knights may join the Temple Knights.By ancient decree, dontchaknow.~|~translationMissing
If the player completed Black Knights' Fortress~|~translationMissing
What? But I am a member of the White Knights! I went and did that stuff with the cabbage and the potion!~|~translationMissing
And I've already done your stupid little mind test thing! You can't get rid of me that easily!~|~translationMissing
If the player did not complete Black Knights' Fortress~|~translationMissing
What? But I've already done your stupid little mind test thing! You can't get rid of me that easily!~|~translationMissing
Calm yourself down [lad/lass]...We have no intention of 'getting rid of you', we are very keen on seeing you join us...~|~translationMissing
Then what's the problem?~|~translationMissing
Although you have performed a mission on behalf of the White Knights, you were never actually working for them.~|~translationMissing
As I say, when our order was founded, we were expected to take the best of the best, and it was assumed that anyone worth having on the team would have been a White Knight already, what?~|~translationMissing
When our order was founded, we were expected to take the best of the best, and it was assumed that anyone worth having on the team would have been a White Knight~|~translationMissing
already, what?~|~translationMissing
Sadly, this is not the case anymore, and the fact that you have to serve as a Squire to a White Knight for a minimum period of five years before you can actually become one tends to put the more short-attention spanned adventurers off joining, what?~|~translationMissing
You want me to be a squire for five years?!?!~|~translationMissing
Haw Haw Haw!No, no, goodness me, no!~|~translationMissing
Five years is a very long period of time nowadays ? ANYTHING could happen in that time, and we need capable [men/women] like yourself as soon as possible.~|~translationMissing
No, I had a bit of a chat with Sir Vey, and we came up with...A different solution to the problem.Assuming you're still interested, of course.~|~translationMissing
Yes I'm interested.~|~translationMissing
I'm still up for joining the Temple Knights, I just don't really feel like spending five years running around shining peoples[sic] boots for them.~|~translationMissing
Haw Haw Haw!~|~translationMissing
I quite understand, what?No, don't worry, we were doing a little research into the White Knight Charter, and found an interesting loophole, what?~|~translationMissing
Loophole?What kind of loophole?~|~translationMissing
Well, you don't need to worry about the details, you just do as I tell you and it will all work out for us both, what?~|~translationMissing
I guess...I don't really like blindly following orders though...~|~translationMissing
No, I'm bored now.~|~translationMissing
No, to be honest I'm getting sick of all these excuses and procrastination.Plus being an initiate was nowhere near as fun as I thought it would be.~|~translationMissing
I'd rather just go off by myself and kill stuff for cash.~|~translationMissing
Well, sorry to hear you say that old boy, but I can't hold it against you.~|~translationMissing
You will of course still be entitled to all that we can provide you with at an initiate level, but sadly you will never advance beyond that in our order.Was there anything you wanted?~|~translationMissing
(Shows standard dialogue.)~|~translationMissing
Ask about the Wanted! Quest~|~translationMissing
So what exactly do you want me to do?~|~translationMissing
Well now, it's really very simple.I want you to go to Sir Amik, tell him that you have decided to not join the Temple Knights, and that you have decided to become a White Knight instead.~|~translationMissing
Okaaaay....~|~translationMissing
If you run into any problems with that, come and see me.~|~translationMissing
How will all that help?~|~translationMissing
I don't exactly understand how that will help me become a White Knight...~|~translationMissing
Ah, your curiosity does you credit old boy! Let me tell you a little history lesson.~|~translationMissing
Many centuries ago, the founders of the White Knights realized that in times of crisis, a long waiting period for new Knights could be disastrous for the kingdom, so they added a clause to the founding charter that would~|~translationMissing
allow any citizen who has performed an act in the name of the White Knight to become deputised on a purely temporary basis to a full-fledged White Knight.~|~translationMissing
Many centuries ago, the founders of the White Knights realized that in times of crisis, a long waiting period for new Knights could be disastrous for the kingdom, so they added a clause to the founding charter that would allow~|~translationMissing
any noteworthy citizen to become deputised on a purely temporary basis to a full-fledged White Knight.~|~translationMissing
So how does that affect me?~|~translationMissing
Well now, your actions in the Black Knights' Fortress on behalf of the White Knights make you eligible to be deputised.~|~translationMissing
Well now, any one of the various acts of heroism you've performed in service to the kingdom makes you eligible to be deputised.~|~translationMissing
Besides, you passed the trials to become a Temple Knight, what? If you're good enough to join the elite, then we'd not hesitate to deputise you into the White Knights.~|~translationMissing
But if deputisation's only temporary, and I have to be a 'proper' White Knight to then become a Temple Knight, doesn't that mean that I am still going to have to squire for Amik for five years?~|~translationMissing
Ah, well this is where the beauty of the plan lies, dontchaknow?~|~translationMissing
Once you have been deputised, for the time that you are still working for their order, you are subject to all of the same rules and regulations that normal White Knights are, which means you are also eligible for battlefield~|~translationMissing
promotions.~|~translationMissing
I... don't understand...~|~translationMissing
However, should you achieve some great feat while serving as a White Knight that you would be eligible for a promotion from, then by their own rules you would then have to be raised to a higher level within their order, and~|~translationMissing
it would therefore become impossible to remove your rank, or make you no longer a deputy.~|~translationMissing
So I get to be a White Knight without having to do five years of pointless busywork?~|~translationMissing
Indeed. We Temple Knights have our reputation for a reason, donchaknow?~|~translationMissing
Okay, I guess that makes sense... But we're not in a time of crisis, so doesn't that mean I won't actually get deputised?~|~translationMissing
If we weren't as good at our jobs we were, almost every day would be a day of crisis!~|~translationMissing
All we really need to do is allow the old White Knights to handle a problem that we would normally deal with, and that should be a sufficient crisis to allow you to be deputised, donchaknow.~|~translationMissing
Do I really have to quit the Temple Knights?~|~translationMissing
But... Do I really need to quit the Temple Knights~|~translationMissing
You seem pretty cool, and I really like the armour...~|~translationMissing
You are simply going to tell him that you have decided not to join us so that he will in turn deputise you to join the White Knights! We of course still want you to join us, it is just a~|~translationMissing
little... misdirection.~|~translationMissing
You are to go to Sir Amik Varze, leader of the White Knights of Falador, and are to tell him that you have decided not to join the Temple Knights.~|~translationMissing
We will send him a messenger confirming this. He will offer you the opportunity to become his squire, you are to decline, and ask if you can be deputised instead.~|~translationMissing
If you run into any problems with that, you are then to come and see me for further advice.~|~translationMissing
Understood?~|~translationMissing
Um, yeah, I think so...~|~translationMissing
Hello Sir. Amik~|~translationMissing
Hello Friend~|~translationMissing
If the player has not asked Tiffy about his plan~|~translationMissing
Well, I did have something you may have been interested in, but I've been given orders not to approach you for trivial matters now that you are a member of the Temple Knights.~|~translationMissing
Aaaaawwwww...~|~translationMissing
got any jobs for me to do today?~|~translationMissing
Well, I did have something you may be interested in, but I've been given orders not to-~|~translationMissing
Can I just stop you right there?~|~translationMissing
I am no longer a member of the Temple Knights, I have entirely renounced my application because after many hours of soul searching I have come to the conclusion that I desperately want to become a White Knight instead!~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing Initiate Armour~|~translationMissing
You don't want to be a Temple Knight anymore?~|~translationMissing
That is correct, yes.~|~translationMissing
But you are wearing their armour!~|~translationMissing
So? Did you hear me bad mouth their armour? The armour is cool, I kept the armour!~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure I understand... You wish to desert the Temple Knights in favour of my own humble White Knights?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely!~|~translationMissing
And this is definitely not some kind of elaborate hoax to get my application processed faster.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, did you say something just then?~|~translationMissing
No... Not if you didn't hear it...~|~translationMissing
...Well anyway, for the fine work you achieved at that incident in the Black Knights Fortress, I would be honoured to accept you as my squire.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Black Knights' Fortress~|~translationMissing
...Well anyway, I would be honoured to accept you as my Squire.~|~translationMissing
So What do you say?~|~translationMissing
What does being a Squire entail?~|~translationMissing
So what exactly does being a squire consist of, then?~|~translationMissing
You will spend the next five years of your life running various errands for me.~|~translationMissing
If I consider you to have done a more than adequate job of this, then I will begin to consider possibly moving your name forwards to becoming a full-fledged member of the Order of the White Knights.~|~translationMissing
So... No killing stuff for you, or anything fun like that...?~|~translationMissing
Not as such, no. Unless you consider killing time by running errands fun...?~|~translationMissing
Well, erm...~|~translationMissing
So what say you Player? Spend five long years of your life doing pointless busywork without pay for me, on the off chance that at some point in the future I may put your name forward as a novice White Knight?~|~translationMissing
Yes please! I would LOVE to be your squire!~|~translationMissing
Wait... Didn't Sir Tiffy tell me to decline...?~|~translationMissing
Nah, Squire me up, Amik!~|~translationMissing
As you wish, from this day forth you are my Squire!~|~translationMissing
No, not right now...~|~translationMissing
Um... As tempting an offer as that sounds Sir Amik, I am really not a fan of waiting around...~|~translationMissing
Now I heard from some completely random stranger that was definitely not Sir Tiffy Cashien as part of an elaborate ruse to fast track my application into the White Knights, that I could be deputised directly as a White~|~translationMissing
Knight, and entirely bypass that while boring waiting for five year thing...~|~translationMissing
That is entirely correct [player name], but I have no idea where you might have heard that for it is a secret guarded only to members of our order!~|~translationMissing
Right. Well, Can I do that instead?~|~translationMissing
Well, a fine adventurer would be a perfect candidate as a deputy in my eyes, but fortunately this can only be done in a time of crisis, and all is currently well.~|~translationMissing
All is well huh? I'll be right back, I just have to go ask...~|~translationMissing
nobody in particular if they can organise...nothing at all to happen.~|~translationMissing
You are a strange one [player name]...~|~translationMissing
So do you have any squiring for me today Amik?~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes in fact I do. I would like you to bring me an Asgarnian Ale.~|~translationMissing
No matured Ale, no other brand, simply an Asgarnian Ale.~|~translationMissing
Okay boss.~|~translationMissing
That is 'Sir Amik' or 'My Liege' ? not 'Boss'.~|~translationMissing
Gotcha, boss.~|~translationMissing
Hi boss.~|~translationMissing
Call me Sir Amik, or liege.~|~translationMissing
Sure thing, boss. I brought you a beer.~|~translationMissing
Anything else you want boss?~|~translationMissing
Well, another Asgarnian Ale would be greatly appreciated. And stop calling me Boss.~|~translationMissing
Sure thing boss!~|~translationMissing
I did it Tiffy! I became Sir Amik's squire!~|~translationMissing
That means in just five short years I can be a White Knight!~|~translationMissing
...What? I told you to decline!~|~translationMissing
Yeeeesssssss.... But I thought it would be more fun to do this?~|~translationMissing
*sigh* This is a less than illustrious start to your career with us [player name].~|~translationMissing
Never mind, all is not lost, I have sent word to Amik that a dangerous criminal we once thought exiled is on the loose again, and that he should send all available White Knights to confront him.~|~translationMissing
This should give him enough of a scare to deputise you immediately.~|~translationMissing
Go and speak to Amik again, and then immediately come back here, we will need to prepare you for your mission.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Tiffy.I've just spoken to Amik, and he says he's fine for me to be deputised as a White Knight, there just needs to be a crisis first.~|~translationMissing
I assume you can arrange a small crisis for me?~|~translationMissing
Haw Haw Haw, fitting right in with the Temple Knight way of thinking, what?~|~translationMissing
Well as a matter of fact, I will not have to organise anything, there is a particularly vicious and dangerous criminal currently at loose!~|~translationMissing
I have already notified Sir Amik through the usual channels, so just go and speak to him quickly, then pop back here and we'll get you equipped for the hunt, what?~|~translationMissing
You know...Is all this back and forth strictly necessary?~|~translationMissing
I don't mean to sound ungrateful for the help you're giving me here, but you could have just got this sorted out before sending me off there in the first place!~|~translationMissing
Ah, yes, well most awfully sorry about all the running around you've been doing old bean, but when it comes to our line of work, sometimes the indirect route is the best, what?~|~translationMissing
I don't understand...?~|~translationMissing
And stop calling me bean!I am not a vegetable, I am a human bean, er, being!~|~translationMissing
Awfully sorry dear heart, it's just a term of affection, what?Anyway...~|~translationMissing
This criminal is a very dangerous fellow, and has some very dangerous friends.~|~translationMissing
If he has no reason to suspect you to be working for us, then he will be a little sloppier than he otherwise might be, because he will just assume you to be one of those stupid White Knights.~|~translationMissing
We want this man caught, for the good of the country, and if we need to fool a few people into thinking you're nothing to do with us, and you have to do a little extra walking, then that's what is going to happen, what?~|~translationMissing
I guess...But this spy stuff is a lot more boring than it sounded at first...~|~translationMissing
Hi Tiffy.What am I supposed to be doing again?~|~translationMissing
Go and report to Sir Amik for 'orders'.You will be unsurprised to find out he will now be prepared to deputise you.~|~translationMissing
After you have spoken to him return here immediately, your life will be at risk without our assistance, and we don't want you dying on your first mission for us, what?~|~translationMissing
Speak about the Wanted! Quest~|~translationMissing
Thank Saradomin you have come back here!~|~translationMissing
We have received word from one of our scouts that the evil Solus Dellagar has returned to Asgarnia!~|~translationMissing
What is worse, it seems he is in possession of dangerous new magics we are powerless against!~|~translationMissing
Please, I implore you in the name of all that is holy, assist us in banishing him from our kingdom once more!~|~translationMissing
I cannot bear to think of the troubles he may bring us...~|~translationMissing
Who is Solus?~|~translationMissing
Solus Dellagar? Who - or what - is that?~|~translationMissing
You have not heard of the infamous murder-mage? He terrorised these lands many years past, thinking himself above the law with his powerful enchantments, but the White Knights finally managed to bring him to~|~translationMissing
justice and he was permanently exiled.~|~translationMissing
Exiled? Why didn't you just kill him? Or, you know, imprison him or whatever?~|~translationMissing
Kill an unarmed foe? That is not the way of Saradomin, nor of the White Knights.~|~translationMissing
As for imprisonment...Solus is a highly dangerous man not just because of his mastery of the magical arts, but for his uncanny resourcefulness.~|~translationMissing
To tell you the truth, I fear that I would be unable to guarantee his captivity in any holding cell belonging to us...~|~translationMissing
So if you can't imprison him, and exile obviously didn't work, you want me to kill him?~|~translationMissing
I did not say that. I did not say that at all. That is against all of our codes of honour.~|~translationMissing
However, should you find yourself in combat with him, and there is no other way, then perhaps for him to die would be best for us all.~|~translationMissing
You understand me, [player name]?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. You've made yourself very clear.~|~translationMissing
So will you aid us in this fight?~|~translationMissing
What will I get for helping?~|~translationMissing
So what will I get if I help you out against this, er, solus doolalala guy then?~|~translationMissing
Why, you will help keep Asgarnia free of malicious influence, and perform a good deed in the name of King Vallance and of the White Knights!~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes I see. So...No monetary compensation or other actual reward then?~|~translationMissing
As Saradomin has told us, 'a good deed is its own reward'.~|~translationMissing
So I don't actually get anything out of this then?~|~translationMissing
Nothing tangible, no, but you will be deputized to act as a White Knight, and you will feel a warm glow inside of having done the right thing.~|~translationMissing
But you can't buy things with a warm glow...~|~translationMissing
So what say you [player name]? Fight with honour in the name of the White Knights against the terrible Solus?~|~translationMissing
Sure I'll help you!~|~translationMissing
Hey, there's nothing I like more than fighting! Deputise me up, and I'll go get this guy for you!~|~translationMissing
May honour and glory follow you in every action.~|~translationMissing
So where should I start looking for this Solus guy anyway?~|~translationMissing
I haven't the faintest idea. Good Luck!~|~translationMissing
I don't feel like helping you right now.~|~translationMissing
A scary mage huh? Sounds like I could get KILLED!~|~translationMissing
Forget that and forget you! No way am I risking my neck unless there is a big fat reward on the table for it!~|~translationMissing
And sometimes not even then...~|~translationMissing
It is a tragedy to hear you speak so, but we must trust in our valour and the wisdom of Saradomin to protect us from this evil man if we can not enlist help against him.~|~translationMissing
Tiffy, it worked exactly to plan!Sir Amik deputised me to take care of this Solus Doolally dude, so let's go get him!~|~translationMissing
His name is Solus Dellagar, and honestly, he is one of the most dangerous men on the planet.~|~translationMissing
Not only is he extremely adapt at magic, he is also quite prepared to use that magic at a moments[sic] notice, because he is quite, quite mad.~|~translationMissing
So...Dragonhide armour and an elemental shield and I'm laughing?~|~translationMissing
You are to act as our agent and track him down, when you have managed to corner him somewhere then we will send in a field recovery team directly to take him away without incident.~|~translationMissing
Riiiiight....So I'm just going to scout him out for you then.~|~translationMissing
Any tips on how to find him?~|~translationMissing
Well old [boy/girl], we need to equip you for the task, but you'll need to get something for me first, what?~|~translationMissing
What kind of stuff?~|~translationMissing
Well, we teach our operatives the value of their equipment by making them pay for it, what?~|~translationMissing
You have two choices here, you can either give me the cash directly, and I will hand it over, or you can bring me the raw materials and I will make you one.~|~translationMissing
Buy One~|~translationMissing
Well we in the Temple Knights have some specific equipment for situations such as this dontchaknow, but you'll need to free up some inventory space first!~|~translationMissing
If the player has enough inventory space and enough money~|~translationMissing
It's 10,000 coins for the Temple Knight Communication Orb. You have that kind of money with you?~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah, I got your money.~|~translationMissing
Then you wish to purchase a Temple Knight Communication Orb?~|~translationMissing
Here take this Communications Orb, or 'CommOrb' for short.~|~translationMissing
It is a precise magical mechanism that we can use to track him, by sending data of the surrounding area back to one of our information operatives at the Temple Knight Headquarters.~|~translationMissing
Your information operative is known as Savant, I suggest you contact them using your CommOrb at your earliest convenience.~|~translationMissing
They will be able to send you any useful data about Solus directly through it for your perusal, dontchaknow.~|~translationMissing
Ok, thanks Tiffy!~|~translationMissing
Actually, no thanks.~|~translationMissing
As you wish, what?~|~translationMissing
If the player has enough inventory space but not enough money~|~translationMissing
I don't have that kind of money with me...~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you would like to just bring me the components of it then, what?~|~translationMissing
Bring me one law rune, one slayer gem and one piece of molten glass and I will make you a Communication Orb.~|~translationMissing
If the player has one of the items needed~|~translationMissing
Can I give you the components I have with me now?~|~translationMissing
Heavens, boy! I am not a pawn shop, to be holding bits and pieces for you while you go off and do something else!~|~translationMissing
No, no you bring me all three components at the same time, what?~|~translationMissing
Okay Tiffy.~|~translationMissing
Have One Made~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have the materials~|~translationMissing
Bring me one Law Rune, one Slayer Gem and one piece of Molten Glass and I will make you a Communication Orb.~|~translationMissing
If the player has all the materials~|~translationMissing
I have all three components for you to make me a Communication Orb out of now Tiffy.~|~translationMissing
Excellent!You wish me to make you one now then, what?~|~translationMissing
Hi Tiffy. What am I supposed to be doing again?~|~translationMissing
Bringing me either cash or items so that I can equip you for your mission correctly.~|~translationMissing
You are hunting for Solus Dellagar, the evil criminal mastermind.~|~translationMissing
I suggest you contact Savant through your CommOrb and see if she can send you any relevant information about your assignment.~|~translationMissing
Hello...?~|~translationMissing
Savant~|~translationMissing
Well, hello!You must be [player name]?Sir Tiffy told me to expect you to call in on this frequency!~|~translationMissing
So what do you think?Pretty nifty little piece of kit this crystal, huh?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, it must be very useful.~|~translationMissing
Oh, trust me you'll find out exactly how useful! Now, was there something you wanted?~|~translationMissing
Current Assignment~|~translationMissing
Hi Savant!I was wondering if you could give me details on my current assignment?~|~translationMissing
Okaaaaay...Bringing up your current assignment details...~|~translationMissing
Oh!You're chasing Solus Dellagar?~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah!So any information you can give me?~|~translationMissing
Listen [player name].Solus is an incredibly dangerous criminal, and I don't think his grasp on reality is too tight, if you understand what I'm saying.~|~translationMissing
You really need to take care with this one.I'm amazed you got an assignment as tough as this one as a first assignment to be honest!~|~translationMissing
So, how would you suggest I go about finding him?~|~translationMissing
Well, this CommOrb can use the scan function to find him, but its range is very limited.~|~translationMissing
So I have to just wander around the place looking for him?~|~translationMissing
No, that would take far too long...Listen, I am going to transfer all information on Solus that we currently have to your CommOrb.~|~translationMissing
You should be able to find a hint of where to find him by examining it.~|~translationMissing
The Library tells me that we have two visual recordings from SpyOrbs available to you, as well as a standard dossier.~|~translationMissing
I would suggest the people that the SpyOrbs were observing, when they picked up records of Solus, would be a good place to start your investigation.~|~translationMissing
Who are these people then?~|~translationMissing
Okay just checking now...~|~translationMissing
Record one is from a routine monitoring of Lord Daquarius.~|~translationMissing
In case you haven't heard of him, he is the leader of the Kinshra, also known as Black Knights.~|~translationMissing
As a major enemy of the White Knights we have had him under observation for some time now, so it was pretty lucky that Solus decided to visit him.~|~translationMissing
So where would I find this Lord Daquarius?~|~translationMissing
He has a secret Black Knight training ground deep in the heart of Taverley dungeon, along with holding facilities for prisoners who they wish to interrogate later.~|~translationMissing
He is almost certain to be found thereabouts.~|~translationMissing
And what is Record 2 about?~|~translationMissing
Just checking...Ah yes.~|~translationMissing
This shady fellow is a member of the Zamorakian Magical Institute.~|~translationMissing
We suspect them to be the group responsible for destroying the Wizards Tower all of those years ago, as well as other more recent acts of sabotage.~|~translationMissing
We also suspect that they have been responsible for a number of thefts of a mysterious rock that the Wizards Tower has started producing, but don't have much intelligence about that.~|~translationMissing
We set up an observation SpyOrb in a known Zamorakian shrine in south-east Varrock, but he moves between there and the wilderness just north of Edgeville quite frequently.~|~translationMissing
He doesn't seem much of a threat, but we placed him under observation anyway, which seems to have paid off by getting some more information about Solus.~|~translationMissing
From the look of the record, he would be worth talking to as well.~|~translationMissing
Thanks Savant!~|~translationMissing
Any time, [player name].Over and out.~|~translationMissing
So...Savant...That's an unusual name...~|~translationMissing
Well, obviously it's not my real name!~|~translationMissing
My real name is Elyssa Van Lendes, but for operational purposes I am called Savant.~|~translationMissing
So what exactly do you do for the Temple Knights?~|~translationMissing
I am the S.M.R. and Chief Librarian for the Temple Knights.~|~translationMissing
S.M.R?What's that?~|~translationMissing
It stands for Senior Mystical Researcher.The Temple Knights have a world class research team investigating new types of magic constantly.As senior researcher, and liaison, I can pass on information to the rest of the Temple Knights.~|~translationMissing
Many of the devices used by the Temple Knights such as our CommOrbs and SpyOrbs were first designed by my team as experimental devices, and have since become standard field equipment!~|~translationMissing
I have always had a gift for magic, and have spent most of my life trying to find applications for it that would serve our order and give us an edge over our opponents.~|~translationMissing
Your opponents?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, don't think for a second that we are the only secret organisation in Gielinor!~|~translationMissing
There are many factions in these lands, some almost as magically advanced and organised as ourselves!~|~translationMissing
It is a constant struggle to keep our operatives with advanced magical equipment that our opponents don't have - this is why we have the self-destruct safeguards, to prevent our equipment ever falling into unfriendly hands.~|~translationMissing
So how did you end up working for the Temple Knights?~|~translationMissing
I would have thought someone like you would have ended up researching at the Wizards' Tower or something instead...~|~translationMissing
Oh yes...The Wizards' Tower...~|~translationMissing
Let me tell you something, the mages who work there are idiots!They told me that magical research wasn't suitable for 'just a girl' and that I would be 'too scared' to research for them effectively!~|~translationMissing
Luckily the Temple Knights are far more open minded about things, and I really feel like my work is making a difference to them!~|~translationMissing
Ok, thanks Savant, that was very interesting.~|~translationMissing
Hey, we're all Temple Knights here, right?Glad I could help, [player name]~|~translationMissing
Savant over and out.~|~translationMissing
The Temple Knights~|~translationMissing
Hi Savant.I was just wondering if you could give me a little information about the Temple Knights?~|~translationMissing
I've just realised that I really don't know very much about them...~|~translationMissing
Well, you are not officially a full fledged Temple Knight now, are you Initiate [player name]?~|~translationMissing
I am afraid that means for security reasons I can only give you a brief overview of the organisation...~|~translationMissing
Well, that's better than nothing right?~|~translationMissing
That is usually the case, yes, I agree.Well, let's see if I remember how this goes...'Legends tell us that Lord Saradomin once walked these lands amongst us, and delivered his wisdom unto us personally, so that we could grow wise in his honour.~|~translationMissing
But then came the war, that shattered our lands, and the interloper banished our land from us!~|~translationMissing
But the wisdom of Saradomin knew that such events might occur, and he laid plans in secret amongst his most devout followers!~|~translationMissing
Those warriors whose hearts were as pure as their minds were sharp were called to him, and were made into his Temple Knights, for they were the Knights that guarded his very first Temple.~|~translationMissing
All who dwelled in his lands knew that the Temple Knights were the honoured, the blessed, the personally chosen warriors of Saradomin, and thus were they given great freedom and authority in all of our Lords lands.~|~translationMissing
But with Saradomin no longer with us, the Temple Knights were no longer honoured and respected by all!~|~translationMissing
Rather, they were made targets by Saradomins[sic] enemies, and driven from the lands unjustly!~|~translationMissing
Thus it was that they became a secret force, hidden from the eyes of Saradomins[sic] enemies, that could strike against evil in his name swiftly and quietly whenever they may be needed.'~|~translationMissing
Something like that I think, it's been a long time since I heard it last...~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks Savant.~|~translationMissing
(Observation Orb #BK-LD-577786 Record begins...)~|~translationMissing
Solus Dellagar~|~translationMissing
Lord Daquarius! Still festering in your pathetic little dungeon, I see.~|~translationMissing
Lord Daquarius~|~translationMissing
Solus. I thought you dead many moons past...~|~translationMissing
Ha! Wishful thinking, perhaps?~|~translationMissing
Cut the banter, Solus. What do you want? You know you are not welcome here.~|~translationMissing
Now is that any way to talk to a fellow Zamorakian?~|~translationMissing
You are not a Zamorakian! You worship nothing but your own selfish greed.~|~translationMissing
Ah... Such mistrust of your forgotten ally! Why did I ever leave these lands?~|~translationMissing
You left because your own stupidity brought the wrath of the Temple Knights upon you. Now I ask you a final time before I draw my blade~|~translationMissing
WHAT do you WANT?~|~translationMissing
Oh... nothing much. I just thought you would like to know that I have returned as your new master.~|~translationMissing
The Kinshra are not your personal soldiers Solus! I will not waste any of my warriors in your foolish schemes!~|~translationMissing
And that is your final answer Daquarius?~|~translationMissing
Leave. Now. Or there will be blood shed between us.~|~translationMissing
You would threaten Solus Dellagar? Have you forgotten just who I am? Perhaps you need reminding!~|~translationMissing
(Solus casts ice barrage killing two black knights and greatly wounding Daquarius)~|~translationMissing
Still alive Daquarius? Good! I won't have to remind you of my power again next time! Make sure you are more prepared to follow orders next time I come to your little Taverley hideout!~|~translationMissing
(Solus teleports out)~|~translationMissing
I swear... in the name of *cough* Zamorak... I will see you rot for this Solus...~|~translationMissing
(Observation Orb #VA-ZM-000964 Record begins...)~|~translationMissing
Mage~|~translationMissing
What? Who dares... Oh no. Oh no, no, no.~|~translationMissing
Well, what have we here? A shrine to Zamorak in the middle of Varrock?~|~translationMissing
S-S-Solus???~|~translationMissing
I assume my reputation precedes me!~|~translationMissing
Please. Please don't kill me. I have no riches, I am but a magical researcher...~|~translationMissing
Kill you? HAH HAH HAH! My dear fellow, if I wanted you dead, you ALREADY WOULD BE!~|~translationMissing
I... I don't know w-what you want Solus...but whatever it is, please, just t-take it and leave, please.~|~translationMissing
Well I am particularly interested in your brains at the moment! But you wouldn't want me taking those and leaving, now would you?~|~translationMissing
My b-brains? I... I don't understand...~|~translationMissing
I am interested in your research!~|~translationMissing
My... r-research? I c-cannot let you have my research it is being done in order to assist my lord Zamorak.~|~translationMissing
Ah! But he is not here, is he?~|~translationMissing
No...I...~|~translationMissing
Ah-ah-ah!~|~translationMissing
(Solus casts a binding spell)~|~translationMissing
You are going nowhere just yet sir.~|~translationMissing
P-please I meant no disrespect Solus, please do not kill me...~|~translationMissing
With your most interesting research! No, I will be content with simply taking your money sir!~|~translationMissing
Take it, take it all!~|~translationMissing
Well a most productive trip on all accounts! I will see you again...Very soon!~|~translationMissing
What want you with lord of Kinshra? Speak!~|~translationMissing
I am here on behalf of the White Knights...~|~translationMissing
Pah! Begone, fool, or prepare to taste my blade!~|~translationMissing
Now wait a minute, this concerns a friend of yours....~|~translationMissing
A friend of mine? What friend of mine would the Temple Knights show any intere-~|~translationMissing
Oh. This... Is about Solus, isn't it?~|~translationMissing
Bingo.~|~translationMissing
Then let me assure you, that monster is no 'friend' of mine - if indeed such a creature even has 'friends'!~|~translationMissing
No, that man is certainly no friend of mine nor the Kinshra.~|~translationMissing
So you will help me find him?~|~translationMissing
No fool... You and your White Knight cronies are no friend of the Kinshra either.~|~translationMissing
I will help neither of you, and I wish you all a slow and painful death.~|~translationMissing
You know...I'm sure I could MAKE you tell me where he is...~|~translationMissing
Is that a threat, whelp? Do your worst. I care not for my own life, I stand only for the protection of the Kinshra!~|~translationMissing
Player? I've been monitoring you. He's telling the truth, so don't try to bluff him by starting a fight.~|~translationMissing
All of our records show that the only thing he will make a stand for is the protection of his men, and he has little regard for his own safety in comparison.~|~translationMissing
You're going to have to find some other way to intimidate him into giving you the information we need.~|~translationMissing
Understood. Player out.~|~translationMissing
Stop! I will tell you what you want! Please... leave my men be...~|~translationMissing
Ok Daquarius, you tell me the whereabouts of Solus Dellagar right now, or I will put every Black Knight here to their death in front of you!~|~translationMissing
*Sigh* I should have known the White Knights would be my ruin once again...~|~translationMissing
I do not know his exact whereabouts, and when last we met we did not leave...on the best of terms.~|~translationMissing
All I know is that he left behind some fur when he left, I would expect him to be in an area with furred creatures of some sort.~|~translationMissing
What king of fur? Dog? Wolf? Bear?~|~translationMissing
I do not know, I am a warrior, not a zoo keeper. It was not bear fur, I know that much.~|~translationMissing
That's it? That's your help? You'd better not be lying Daquarius, or...~|~translationMissing
Calm yourself Player, he is telling the truth.~|~translationMissing
How do you know?~|~translationMissing
I am monitoring your conversation through the CommOrb, his physiology shows none of the changes we usually get when someone lies to us.~|~translationMissing
So this CommOrb thing can work as a lie-detector? That's pretty useful!~|~translationMissing
Yes, it is, but back to the task at hand. I suggest you head to the next subject of our observations, he might be more help in locating Solus.~|~translationMissing
You mean that Zamorakian mage in Varrock?~|~translationMissing
Yes, he would seem a likely bet. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
I am looking for information about a very dangerous man...I believe he visited you quite recently.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you mean that accursed Solus!~|~translationMissing
Yes, him.I need to find him and make sure he doesn't come back to these lands.~|~translationMissing
You are working for the Temple Knights correct?~|~translationMissing
No, don't deny it, I recognise the magical signature of your Communication Orb, a very nice piece of equipment indeed.~|~translationMissing
I will tell you what I know in exchange for it, I believe such a device could be very useful to my research...~|~translationMissing
Even if we wanted to let the ZMI have access to our research, the built in security magics would destroy it before trading anyway!~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I cannot trade you my Communications Orb...~|~translationMissing
Ah well, it was worth a try, but I did not seriously expect you to part with it.~|~translationMissing
Then perhaps you will be willing to trade something else for your information...?~|~translationMissing
I have little information, and would give it freely to make sure Solus is... disposed of... but unfortunately I am somewhat... financially distraught at the moment due to a recent... incident.~|~translationMissing
You mean Solus robbed you of all of your money?~|~translationMissing
...Yes.He took a large degree of my research into various things as well, but my research is inside my mind and easily replaceable, the money I possessed was essential for my experimentation, and as I have no real skills to speak of, is not so easily replaceable...~|~translationMissing
You want me to pay you for information?~|~translationMissing
No... not as such.You know of the substance known as 'rune essence' yes?~|~translationMissing
A small number of those will allow me to create runes from them, which I may then sell and get myself back on my feet.~|~translationMissing
Twenty parts of rune essence is the price for my information.You may take it or leave it...~|~translationMissing
Hi [Player name], it sounds like a pretty good deal for this kind of information to me, but it's your call.We REALLY need to find Solus as soon as possible though, who knows what kind of damage he might cause now he is at large again!~|~translationMissing
So you have information about the whereabouts of Solus Dellagar?~|~translationMissing
I do indeed.My price for this information is 20 pieces of rune essence.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have essence~|~translationMissing
Okay. I'll go get those for you then.~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than 20 essence~|~translationMissing
I have some essences with me, if you would take those...?~|~translationMissing
I will not haggle you on my price.20 Rune essences, and not a single essence less.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll go get those for you then.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 20 essence~|~translationMissing
I have your essences right here, take them.~|~translationMissing
Okay, now you have your essence, give me my information.~|~translationMissing
Certainly.As I say, I have little information, but the cost was not too dear, was it?~|~translationMissing
Get on with it, I haven't got all day to waste.~|~translationMissing
As you wish.As a powerful magician, I could sense his aura once I had encountered him, and it definitely moved East of here when he left me.~|~translationMissing
He went East.That's it?That's your 'information'?~|~translationMissing
I am sorry I cannot be more specific, but that is all of the information I have to offer...~|~translationMissing
Okay, so Daquarius told us he was probably somewhere with furry animals of some kind, and this mage has told us that he is East of here...~|~translationMissing
Any ideas? Frankly, I'm stumped.I just don't have enough information to work out where he might be...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm.Wolf fur... and the East...I know where he is.~|~translationMissing
He will be in Canifis.He must be.~|~translationMissing
Wow, that's some good thinking [Player name]!Okay, let's head there and get him!~|~translationMissing
Ok Player, I'm going to begin a low level scan for Solus now...~|~translationMissing
Any signs?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm...These readings are very strange...~|~translationMissing
There's... SOMETHING here...You know, I'm sure I've seen readings like this somewhere before...~|~translationMissing
Just give me a minute to cross reference the records in the Library. I know that I've seen readings like this before...~|~translationMissing
GAH!This is infuriating!It's on the tip of my tongue...~|~translationMissing
Well, that Zamorakian mage mentioned that he had a strong magical aura, perhaps that is it?~|~translationMissing
No...no, it is something...~|~translationMissing
Oh my!I know what it is!~|~translationMissing
Savant...?~|~translationMissing
Many years ago the Temple Knights were studying teleportation techniques, and found a strange dimension that was accessed when teleporting..~|~translationMissing
We stopped the research as it was too dangerous to be practically useful, but our initial studies showed that we could use the entire dimension as a kind of scrying glass to see a precise point where we wished to teleport to, then teleport extremely slowly between two points.~|~translationMissing
How is teleporting really slowly particularly useful?~|~translationMissing
Well, basically, you are stretched so thinly between dimensions that you effectively become invisible!~|~translationMissing
From your perspective you can see three places simultaneously, and can choose to move between all three at will!~|~translationMissing
I'm... not sure I follow...~|~translationMissing
Let me give you an example~|~translationMissing
If you were in Falador castle, and wished to teleport to Varrock, then you could use this 'slow-teleport' technique to be in both places simultaneously, but invisible to anyone in either.~|~translationMissing
You could also move freely between the two invisibly and then choose which place you wished to end up, simply by concentrating on the location you wanted to appear in.~|~translationMissing
Needless to say, in our line of work this could come in very handy for sneaking around unobserved...~|~translationMissing
But you abandoned this research?Why?~|~translationMissing
It is far too dangerous.In my example I only used two places, but in practice there is a third place involved.It is a strange, empty dimension that teleports seem to pass through.~|~translationMissing
Frankly, the human mind isn't equipped to cope with processing so much information simultaneously, and the test subjects started to display... behavioral problems...~|~translationMissing
Er...That doesn't sound good...~|~translationMissing
No, it wasn't~|~translationMissing
Aggressiveness was highly increased, and there were numerous perceptual faults, hallucinations and the like.~|~translationMissing
We ceased experimentation immediately, there are enough things in this world to haunt a Temple Knight, we did not see the need to create anymore.~|~translationMissing
But this signature you are finding is the same as this 'slow-teleport' experiment created?~|~translationMissing
No... it is not exactly the same...~|~translationMissing
But it is close enough to be a cause of concern.~|~translationMissing
Either someone else has found this strange dimension and begun their own research, and reached the same conclusions that we did...~|~translationMissing
Or...We have had a security leak within the Temple Knights and abandoned research has been sold to our enemies!~|~translationMissing
Well, I can see how that might be a cause for concern, but right now our priority is Solus, right?~|~translationMissing
Yes [player name], you're right.But if he is using this 'slow-teleport' technique, then that means it is going to be a lot harder to catch him!~|~translationMissing
Because he is invisible and in three separate places simultaneously?~|~translationMissing
Exactly.Listen, I might be able to block his teleportation magics using your CommOrb, but I will need you to get close to him, and if we're unlucky then he will end up teleporting to the point away from you instead of appearing in front of you [sic]~|~translationMissing
Well, we have nothing else to try, right?What will I have to do?~|~translationMissing
Use the 'Scan' function of your CommOrb, if he is in the vicinity it should knock him out of his 'in-between' state, and make him appear.~|~translationMissing
So I should try a scan here in Canifis?~|~translationMissing
That would seem best...Savant over and out.~|~translationMissing
Hello there [player name].What can I help you with?~|~translationMissing
Hi Savant.Where am I supposed to look for Solus again?~|~translationMissing
The clue was that Solus is somewhere where you might find Fur[sic], East of Varrock...~|~translationMissing
(See First chat with Savant section)~|~translationMissing
There doesn't seem to be anything unusual about these readings Player... Looks like your hunch was wrong. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
Negative result, Player. Looks like you're barking up the wrong tree. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
Scan results are negative, Player. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
Background magical levels all seem within normal tolerable limits Player...I don't think this can be the right place...Savant out.~|~translationMissing
Checking incoming data...Nope, all clear here. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
Nope...I'm not picking up anything unusual near here...Savant out.~|~translationMissing
Analysis is negative I'm afraid. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
The background magical levels are slightly above average here, but not enough to signify anything. I think you're in the wrong place. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
I think you're in the wrong place. Savant out.~|~translationMissing
What the...?~|~translationMissing
Well well well!I was wondering when the White Knights would come looking for me!~|~translationMissing
Well you'll have to be quicker than that, my friend!~|~translationMissing
(Solus teleports)~|~translationMissing
He got away...~|~translationMissing
So what can we do now?~|~translationMissing
Wait a second...~|~translationMissing
There was another item in the teleport with him...~|~translationMissing
Well, I might be able to retrieve it from the slow-teleport!~|~translationMissing
It might give us a clue as to the second location Solus is in!~|~translationMissing
Well what are you waiting for?Try and get it!~|~translationMissing
If the item is Greenman's ale~|~translationMissing
Savant transfers the item to you.~|~translationMissing
It's a beer?~|~translationMissing
I doubt he's getting drunk in hiding...~|~translationMissing
That type of beer is only sold in one place that I know of~|~translationMissing
If the item is Wizard hat~|~translationMissing
It's...a wizard hat?~|~translationMissing
So he is improving his dress sense you think?~|~translationMissing
I think it's more likely he happens to be in an area where there are many wizards around.~|~translationMissing
If the item is Ear muffs~|~translationMissing
It's... ear muffs?~|~translationMissing
Why on gielinor would he be wearing those?~|~translationMissing
Well, they are standard equipment for any slayer looking to kill Banshees...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Goblin armour~|~translationMissing
It's... goblin armour?~|~translationMissing
Goblin armour? Why would he wear that?~|~translationMissing
Well, it must be a place here there is a lot of it around for it to have been caught in his teleport...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Fake beard~|~translationMissing
It's...a fake beard?~|~translationMissing
What the...? You think he is in disguise somewhere?~|~translationMissing
I've seen this design of beard before... But I cannot remember where...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Bear fur~|~translationMissing
It's... fur?~|~translationMissing
Fur? How does that help us find him?~|~translationMissing
Well, this is not fur directly from an animal, look it has been prepared for sale...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Eye patch~|~translationMissing
It's... an eye patch?~|~translationMissing
Do you think he might be injured?~|~translationMissing
No, I think he must be somewhere where there are a lot of people who wear eye patches...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Wizard's hat (Cream)~|~translationMissing
It's... a hat?~|~translationMissing
How does a hat help us?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I don't know. Maybe somewhere where hats like this are common?~|~translationMissing
If the item is Castle wars ticket~|~translationMissing
It's... a ticket?~|~translationMissing
I am sure I have seen tickets like that somewhere before...~|~translationMissing
Well, wherever it is that you have seen them, I would guess he is nearby!~|~translationMissing
If the item is Fremennik cloak~|~translationMissing
It's... a cloak?~|~translationMissing
Very stylish, but it doesn't seem to be his colour.~|~translationMissing
I don't think he would have been wearing it... But he might be nearby somewhere that sells this type of cloak.~|~translationMissing
If the item is Toy horsey~|~translationMissing
It's... a toy horse?~|~translationMissing
What a weird thing to be carrying...~|~translationMissing
Well [player name], bear in mind that it might just be an object that as in the vicinity rather than something he was carrying...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Giant frog legs~|~translationMissing
It's... some big frog legs?~|~translationMissing
The frog those came from must be huge!~|~translationMissing
I have heard rumours of giant frogs in a subterranean area...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Unholy symbol~|~translationMissing
It's... an unholy symbol!~|~translationMissing
The symbol of Zamorak? That tells us nothing.~|~translationMissing
Yes, sadly there are many Zamorakians in these lands...But it must be somewhere of special significance...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Red Vine Worm~|~translationMissing
It's... a worm?~|~translationMissing
Maybe he's doing a little fishing?~|~translationMissing
No, this is a very specific worm that is only found in one place...~|~translationMissing
If the item is Banana~|~translationMissing
It's... a banana?~|~translationMissing
A banana?How is that a clue to where he is?~|~translationMissing
Well, for it to have got caught in his teleport, it must be a place where there are many around...~|~translationMissing
[player name], I want you to search for him, and use your Comm-Orb to scan for him if you think he is nearby!~|~translationMissing
Okay I'll head off immediately. Let's hope we're not too late.~|~translationMissing
You again???~|~translationMissing
I warn you, if you interfere with my plans I will see you suffer!~|~translationMissing
Solus!I am here by authority of the White Knights of Falador!~|~translationMissing
Ha!Like I care!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I am attempting to block his teleport...~|~translationMissing
Oh, we have a little magical skill do we?~|~translationMissing
Then let's see how you deal with this!~|~translationMissing
I should have known he would try something like that!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry [player name], I should have stopped him using that spell...~|~translationMissing
That doesn't matter right now Savant, did you get a reading of where his teleport was coming from?~|~translationMissing
The spell is still running, wait a moment...There!~|~translationMissing
It's a cape...~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure how much help in tracking him that is.~|~translationMissing
More than you might think Savant.This type of cape used to be called the Cape of Champions...~|~translationMissing
Well I still don't know what help that is, but if you have an idea here he might be you should head there immediately!~|~translationMissing
Well now, I am beginning to get sick of your constant interference!~|~translationMissing
Or at least I would be if you weren't so laughably easy to escape from.~|~translationMissing
(Screen goes black)~|~translationMissing
*cough*Savant?*cough* I can't... *cough*~|~translationMissing
He threw some kind of smoke at me or something...~|~translationMissing
Don't worry about it [player name], he may have escaped AGAIN, but I still have him on my tracking spell...~|~translationMissing
Okay, the smoke's cleared, and you don't seem to have been damaged by it!~|~translationMissing
You're lucky I think, readings show it was highly poisonous!~|~translationMissing
Let's see if I grabbed anything useful from him while he was teleporting...~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm on my way.This Solus guy is really beginning to get on my nerves!~|~translationMissing
This is getting very tiresome!~|~translationMissing
Little White Knight, I command powers beyond your imagination!~|~translationMissing
If you do not cease pursuing me, I will be forced to use them upon you!~|~translationMissing
You can't threaten me old man...~|~translationMissing
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.~|~translationMissing
This charade bores me!~|~translationMissing
[player name] I am reading a huge power surge from Solus, be very careful...~|~translationMissing
(Solus casts Flames of Zamorak)~|~translationMissing
[player name]!!!~|~translationMissing
Ow!What happened?~|~translationMissing
I managed to shield you from most of his attack, and bring you back to Falador Castle, but you are lucky I was monitoring, that could have killed you!~|~translationMissing
I don't understand though Savant, you said he could only be in a few places simultaneously...~|~translationMissing
But he keeps getting away!And he keeps moving around!~|~translationMissing
You're right [player name], I don't know how he is doing it...~|~translationMissing
But he can't run forever, and every time he tries something against you, I can update your CommOrb to prevent it.~|~translationMissing
So he isn't going to shoot me like that again?~|~translationMissing
No, [player name].I am sorry that I let him hurt you like that...~|~translationMissing
But keep chasing him, together we are going to bring him to justice!~|~translationMissing
You're right about that, there's no way I'm letting him get away with treating me like that!~|~translationMissing
So did we get any clues to his real location from that last scan?~|~translationMissing
That's the spirit [player name]!Just awaiting the data to come through...~|~translationMissing
It's... a very strange weapon?~|~translationMissing
I recognise that...~|~translationMissing
It's the type of spear used by the Dorgeshuun goblins.~|~translationMissing
The who?I've never heard of them before...~|~translationMissing
Well, if you know who or what they are, you should go and see them, Solus must be nearby!~|~translationMissing
You should probably take a minute to restock on supplies and heal up though [player name].~|~translationMissing
I know we can find him and bring him to justice, but we don't want you dying while doing so!~|~translationMissing
Okay Savant, I'll heal up, then go looking for him amongst the Dorgeshuun.~|~translationMissing
Oh thank you, you have freed me!~|~translationMissing
W-what?Who are you?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I am but a poor maiden kidnapped by the evil Solus!~|~translationMissing
But you chased him so hard, that now I am free...~|~translationMissing
[player name], I am getting some strange readings from this 'maiden'...~|~translationMissing
Muhahaha!Sucker!~|~translationMissing
(Solus stuns the player and escapes)~|~translationMissing
Sorry [player name], I should have spotted his little trick earlier...~|~translationMissing
Are you okay?That looked like a nasty sucker punch...~|~translationMissing
Oooohhhh...~|~translationMissing
Did anyone get the number of that wagon?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry [player name], I am reconfiguring your CommOrb to compensate for any camouflage magics.~|~translationMissing
Please tell me you have a reading on his actual location by now, this chasing him around the houses is becoming irritating...~|~translationMissing
No, but every time he escapes you I am shutting down his teleport to a specific area.~|~translationMissing
I think we are on the final stretch now [player name]!~|~translationMissing
I will be able to shut his teleports down permanently in 2, perhaps 3, more scans...~|~translationMissing
Keep up the chase [player name]! We nearly have him cornered!~|~translationMissing
Uh...Out of interest, what am I going to do with an insane super-powerful murderous mage when he's cornered?~|~translationMissing
Leave that to me and the Temple Knights [player name].~|~translationMissing
Just follow your orders and continue the chase, and his days are numbered.~|~translationMissing
Well okay then, where should I head now?~|~translationMissing
Examining readings now...~|~translationMissing
Let's see what we managed to snag in the scan this time!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm on my way ? and Solus had better watch out, I am up to here with his annoying tricks!~|~translationMissing
Well you ARE a persistent [fellow/madam] aren't you?~|~translationMissing
I am here to take you in Solus. You can forget your little tricks.~|~translationMissing
Little tricks, you say? Well how about this one!~|~translationMissing
Solus~|~translationMissing
Say hello to my little friend! And goodbye to me![sic]~|~translationMissing
(Black Knight spawns)~|~translationMissing
Solus commands you to die now!~|~translationMissing
Okay, we have our scan results...~|~translationMissing
It's some kind of highly magically susceptible rock...~|~translationMissing
Isn't that the same rock that you gave that Zamorakian mage in Varrock?~|~translationMissing
Yeah it is, which means I know where he is, and how to get there!~|~translationMissing
It's a mine for Rune Essence, but there are only supposed to be a few people who know how to get there...~|~translationMissing
There he is!~|~translationMissing
Okay, I've blocked all exits from this place except for Temple Knight teleports...~|~translationMissing
I think we finally have him!~|~translationMissing
Argh! I am so sick of your interference!~|~translationMissing
I think it is time we end this once and for all!~|~translationMissing
In the name of the White Knights of Falador, and of the Temple Knights of Saradomin, I am placing you under arrest!~|~translationMissing
You and what army?~|~translationMissing
This one, Solus!~|~translationMissing
Ha!~|~translationMissing
You'll never take me alive!~|~translationMissing
(Solus casts Ice Barrage killing the Temple Knight reinforcements)~|~translationMissing
You... You meddlesome... You meddlesome freak!~|~translationMissing
Player, Solus is very weakened, and we don't have any more fighters to spare!~|~translationMissing
Take him out now! This might be your only chance!~|~translationMissing
YOU DIE NOW!~|~translationMissing
The player takes the hat.~|~translationMissing
Now that Solus is defeated you should take his hat to Sir Amik to prove that you were responsible.~|~translationMissing
Now let's head back...~|~translationMissing
...and may I say~|~translationMissing
VERY well done, [player name]. Very well done indeed.~|~translationMissing
Hello there Player. What can I help you with?~|~translationMissing
Hi Savant. Where am I supposed to be looking for Solus again?~|~translationMissing
You're not looking for Solus Player, you are supposed to be taking his hat to Sir Amik of the White Knights as proof that you have defeated him.~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the hat~|~translationMissing
But I lost his hat...~|~translationMissing
I have sent you a duplicate, try not to lose it.~|~translationMissing
Go and take it to Sir Amik so that he can make you a full-fledged White Knight!~|~translationMissing
Hello, friend.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any other quests for me to do?~|~translationMissing
You are supposed to be looking for Solus Dellagar!~|~translationMissing
The insane magician who is loose once more upon these lands? Remember?~|~translationMissing
But...I've already done that!~|~translationMissing
You have??? Then you must have some proof of your encounter!~|~translationMissing
A weapon perhaps, or an item of clothing?~|~translationMissing
Well of course I do! I mean I did...Look, I lost it okay? Stop hassling me!~|~translationMissing
Look, I am very sorry Player, but if you have no proof of your encounter, I can hardly promote you to be a full White Knight, now can I?~|~translationMissing
Oh man...I think I've messed up...Maybe Savant can help me out somehow? I'd better speak to her.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the hat in the bank~|~translationMissing
Well of course I do! I just happened to think it would be a good idea to leave it in the bank for safe keeping.~|~translationMissing
Well bring it here so that I can authenticate your claim and make you a White Knight!~|~translationMissing
If the player has the hat~|~translationMissing
Well of course I do! I have it right here!~|~translationMissing
Well hand it over then, and let's see it!~|~translationMissing

4.2 Talking to Hudon after the quest~|~translationMissing
You're not sure if the raft is safe to use. Best to leave it alone.~|~translationMissing
Hudon can't hear you because of the noise of the waterfall. Perhaps the acoustics would be better from that island?~|~translationMissing
Almera~|~translationMissing
Ah, hello there. Nice to see an outsider for a change. Are you busy? I have a problem.~|~translationMissing
With a combat level lower than 25~|~translationMissing
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended level of 25.~|~translationMissing
Start the Waterfall Quest?~|~translationMissing
It's my son Hudon, he's always getting into trouble. The boy's convinced there's hidden treasure in the river and I'm a bit worried about his safety, the poor lad can't even swim.~|~translationMissing
I could go and take a look for you if you like?~|~translationMissing
Would you? You are kind. You can use the small raft out back if you wish, do be careful, the current down stream is very strong.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I'm in a rush.~|~translationMissing
Oh okay, never mind.~|~translationMissing
Hello Almera.~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer, have you seen my boy yet?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not, but I'm sure he hasn't gone far.~|~translationMissing
I do hope so, you can't be too careful these days.~|~translationMissing
Gerald~|~translationMissing
Have you seen a small boy?~|~translationMissing
Nope, plenty of small fish though.~|~translationMissing
You board the small raft and push off down stream...~|~translationMissing
...you crash into a small island.~|~translationMissing
Hello son, are you okay? You need help?~|~translationMissing
Hudon~|~translationMissing
It looks like you need the help.~|~translationMissing
Your mum sent me to find you.~|~translationMissing
Don't play nice with me, I know you're looking for the treasure too.~|~translationMissing
Where is this treasure you talk of?~|~translationMissing
Just because I'm small doesn't mean I'm dumb! If I told you, you would take it all for yourself.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could help.~|~translationMissing
I'm fine alone.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... I wonder what this treasure is.~|~translationMissing
So you're still here.~|~translationMissing
I'll find that treasure soon, just you wait and see.~|~translationMissing
You swim out into the water...~|~translationMissing
...but the current is too strong, washing you downstream.~|~translationMissing
Blimey! Where did you come from? Not another one of those treasure hunters are you?~|~translationMissing
Treasure hunters?~|~translationMissing
They say there's treasure hidden within the waterfall, left behind by the old elven king. Not that anyone's ever found anything.~|~translationMissing
Interesting, is there somewhere I can learn more about this?~|~translationMissing
You could ask Hadley the tourist guide. He'll be in this building just here.~|~translationMissing
Well hello, you're still around then.~|~translationMissing
I saw Hudon by the river but he refused to come back with me.~|~translationMissing
Yes he told me, the foolish lad came in drenched to the bone, he had fallen into the waterfall, lucky he wasn't killed! Now he can spend the rest of the summer in his room.~|~translationMissing
Any ideas what I could do while I'm here?~|~translationMissing
Why don't you visit the tourist centre south of the waterfall?~|~translationMissing
Hello traveller. Are you here to fish or to hunt for treasure?~|~translationMissing
Why do you say that?~|~translationMissing
Adventurers pass through here every week, they never find anything though.~|~translationMissing
What treasure are they looking for?~|~translationMissing
Are you on holiday? If so you've come to the right place. I'm Hadley the tourist guide, anything you need to know just ask me. We have some of the most unspoilt wildlife and scenery in Gielinor.~|~translationMissing
People come from miles around to fish in the clear lakes or to wander the beautiful hillsides.~|~translationMissing
It is quite pretty.~|~translationMissing
Surely pretty is an understatement kind sir. Beautiful, amazing or possibly life-changing would be more suitable wording. Have you seen Baxtorian Falls? Named after the elven king who was buried beneath them.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me what happened to the elven king?~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian? I guess he died a long long time ago, it's quite sad really. After leaving his kingdom to deal with invading forces, Baxtorian returned to find his wife Glarial had been captured by the enemy.~|~translationMissing
This destroyed Baxtorian, after years of searching he became a recluse. He went into the secret home he had made for Glarial under the waterfall and sealed himself in. To this day, no one has managed to enter.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I believe we have a book on him upstairs if you want to learn more.~|~translationMissing
Where else is worth visiting around here?~|~translationMissing
There is a lovely spot for a picnic on the hill to the north east, there's a monument to the elven queen Glarial. It really is quite pretty.~|~translationMissing
Who was Glarial?~|~translationMissing
Baxtorian's wife, the only other person who could also enter the waterfall apart from him. She was queen when this land was inhabited by elven kind.~|~translationMissing
Glarial was kidnapped while Baxtorian was away, but they eventually recovered her body and brought her home to rest.~|~translationMissing
That's sad.~|~translationMissing
True, I believe we have a book on Baxtorian and Glarial upstairs if you want to learn more.~|~translationMissing
Is there treasure under the waterfall?~|~translationMissing
Ha ha... Another treasure hunter. Well if there is no one's been able to get to it. They've been searching that river for decades, all to no avail.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, goodbye.~|~translationMissing
Enjoy your visit.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the book~|~translationMissing
You find a book named 'Book on Baxtorian' on the bookcase.~|~translationMissing
You search the bookcase but find nothing of interest~|~translationMissing
You search the books...~|~translationMissing
You don't find anything that you'd ever want to read.~|~translationMissing
You find nothing to interest you.~|~translationMissing
None of them look very interesting~|~translationMissing
Hello again Almera.~|~translationMissing
Well hello again brave adventurer, are you enjoying the tranquil scenery of these parts?~|~translationMissing
Yes, very relaxing.~|~translationMissing
Well I'm glad to hear it[sic] The authorities wanted to dig up this whole area for a mine, but the few locals who lived here wouldn't budge and they gave up.~|~translationMissing
Good for all of us!~|~translationMissing
Hello Hudon.~|~translationMissing
Oh it's you, trying to find my treasure again are you?~|~translationMissing
I didn't know it belonged to you.~|~translationMissing
It will do when I find it. I just need to get into this blasted waterfall I've been washed downstream three times already.~|~translationMissing
It's just those blasted hob-gobs. I locked myself in here for protection. But I've left the key somewhere and now I'm stuck.~|~translationMissing
Okay... I'll have a look for a key.~|~translationMissing
You use the key to unlock the gate.~|~translationMissing
You open the gate and walk through.~|~translationMissing
You find a key in the crate.~|~translationMissing
I'm Golrie, I've been stuck in here for ages. those hob-gobs are trying to steal my family's heirlooms. My grandad gave me all sorts of old junk.~|~translationMissing
Do you mind if I have a look?~|~translationMissing
No, of course not.~|~translationMissing
You look amongst the junk on the floor and find Glarial's pebble.~|~translationMissing
Could I take this old pebble?~|~translationMissing
Oh that, yes have it, it's just some old elven junk I believe.~|~translationMissing
Thanks a lot for the key traveller. I think I'll wait in here until those hob-gobs get bored and leave.~|~translationMissing
Okay, take care Golrie.~|~translationMissing
Hello Golrie.~|~translationMissing
Do you mind if I have another look through this stuff?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has the pebble~|~translationMissing
You look amongst the junk on the floor but find nothing of interest.~|~translationMissing
You look amongst the junk on the floor and find Glarial's pebble but you don't have enough room to take it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has disallowed items~|~translationMissing
You place the pebble in the gravestone's small indent but nothing happens.~|~translationMissing
If the player has no disallowed items~|~translationMissing
You place the pebble in the gravestone's small indent. The stone slab slides back revealing a ladder. You climb down it.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have Glarial's amulet~|~translationMissing
You find a small amulet in the chest.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has Glarial's amulet~|~translationMissing
You search the chest but find nothing.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have Glarial's urn~|~translationMissing
You find an urn full of ashes in the tomb.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has Glarial's urn~|~translationMissing
You search the tomb but find nothing.~|~translationMissing
Hello adventurer, how's your treasure hunt going?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm just sight seeing.~|~translationMissing
No adventurer stays here this long just to sight see. But your business is yours alone, if you need to use the raft go ahead. But please try not crash it this time![sic]~|~translationMissing
Thanks Almera.~|~translationMissing
Not you still, why don't you give up?~|~translationMissing
And miss all the fun!~|~translationMissing
You do understand that anything you find you have to share with me.~|~translationMissing
Why's that?~|~translationMissing
Because I told you about the treasure.~|~translationMissing
Well, I wouldn't count on it.~|~translationMissing
That's not fair.~|~translationMissing
Neither is life kid.~|~translationMissing
You try to use the tree to climb down...~|~translationMissing
...but you slip and fall into the water.~|~translationMissing
You tie the rope to the tree and climb down to the ledge below.~|~translationMissing
You climb into the barrel and push off the edge. You are carried down the river.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing Glarial's amulet~|~translationMissing
You enter the waterfall.~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing Glarial's amulet~|~translationMissing
You try to open the door, but the ledge is suddenly flooded with water...~|~translationMissing
...you are pushed over the waterfall and into the river.~|~translationMissing
You exit the dungeon.~|~translationMissing
If the player has already placed that rune on that pillar~|~translationMissing
You've already put that type of rune on this pillar.~|~translationMissing
If the player used an air rune~|~translationMissing
You place the rune on the pillar. It disappears in a puff of smoke.~|~translationMissing
If the player used an earth rune~|~translationMissing
If the player used a water rune~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet placed all the runes on the pillars~|~translationMissing
You go to place the amulet around the neck of the statue. However, water floods into the room as you do...~|~translationMissing
...you are washed out of the cave and down the river.~|~translationMissing
If the player has placed all the runes~|~translationMissing
You place the amulet around the neck of the statue. You hear a loud rumble from beneath as the floor rises.~|~translationMissing
You go to take the treasure from the chalice. However, water floods into the room as you do...~|~translationMissing
You carefully pour the ashes into the chalice and remove Baxtorian's treasure...~|~translationMissing
The chalice only contains some old ashes.~|~translationMissing
You stole my treasure. I saw you!~|~translationMissing

Have you got my ball back yet?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's in the shed in that garden.~|~translationMissing
You find a key hidden under the flower pot.~|~translationMissing
You don't find anything interesting.~|~translationMissing
You decide not to attract the attention of the witch by playing on the piano.~|~translationMissing
You can't see anything of interest on the stand.~|~translationMissing
This door is locked.~|~translationMissing
Strange... I can't see any kind of lock or handle to open this door...~|~translationMissing
As your bare hands touch the gate you feel a shock.~|~translationMissing
You find a magnet in the cupboard.~|~translationMissing
A mouse runs out of the hole.~|~translationMissing
You attach the magnet to the mouse's harness. The mouse finishes the cheese and runs back into its hole. You hear some odd noises from inside the walls. There is a strange whirring noise from above the door frame.~|~translationMissing
This doesn't seem to be the right magnet to open this door...~|~translationMissing
You have already unlocked this door.~|~translationMissing

You search for the secret compartment mentioned in the diary. Inside it you find a small key. You take the key.~|~translationMissing
There is nothing in the fountain.~|~translationMissing

What could you want with an old woman like me?~|~translationMissing
I am in search of a quest.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... Maybe I can think of something for you.~|~translationMissing
Would you like to become more proficient in the dark arts?~|~translationMissing
Start the Witch's Potion quest?~|~translationMissing
Yes, help me become one with my darker side.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm going to make a potion to help bring out your darker self.~|~translationMissing
You will need certain ingredients.~|~translationMissing
What do I need?~|~translationMissing
You need an eye of newt, a rat's tail, an onion... Oh and a piece of burnt meat.~|~translationMissing
Great, I'll go and get them.~|~translationMissing
No, I have my principles and honour.~|~translationMissing
Suit yourself, but you're missing out.~|~translationMissing
I've heard that you are a witch.~|~translationMissing
Yes it does seem to be getting fairly common knowledge.~|~translationMissing
I fear I may be getting a visit from the witch hunters of Falador before long.~|~translationMissing
I've been looking for those ingredients.~|~translationMissing
So what have you found so far?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't have any of them yet.~|~translationMissing
Well I can't make the potion without them! Remember... You need an eye of newt, a rat's tail, an onion, and a piece of burnt meat. Off you go dear!~|~translationMissing
If the player only has the rat's tail~|~translationMissing

In fact I have everything!~|~translationMissing
Excellent, can I have them then?~|~translationMissing
You pass the ingredients to Hetty and she puts them all into her cauldron. Hetty closes her eyes and begins to chant. The cauldron bubbles mysteriously.~|~translationMissing
Well, is it ready?~|~translationMissing
Ok, now drink from the cauldron.~|~translationMissing
Well are you going to drink the potion or not?~|~translationMissing

8 Attempting to open the ancient casket~|~translationMissing
The name's Veos. I'm a treasure hunter from the wonderous Kingdom of Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Great Kourend? Where's that?~|~translationMissing
Across the sea to the far west. It is a truly magnificent place.~|~translationMissing
Interesting. So what brings you to Lumbridge?~|~translationMissing
I'm here on a bit of a hunt. The hunt for treasure. Back in my home of Great Kourend, I came across a scroll. I believe it will lead me to something of great value.~|~translationMissing
Alas, I've hit a bit of a blocker. The scroll has led me here but as I don't really know the area, I'm not sure what to do next.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Maybe you can. You probably know this area better than I do. You might be able to work the scroll out. I'll be able to reward you if you help.~|~translationMissing
Sounds good, what should I do?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have any free inventory space~|~translationMissing
First you should go and make some room in your inventory. Once you've done that, you can have a look at this scroll.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a free inventory space~|~translationMissing
Take this scroll. It should lead you to the treasure I seek. Once you've found it, meet me at my ship. It's docked at the northernmost pier in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Treasure scroll.)~|~translationMissing
Awesome. Anything else I should know?~|~translationMissing
You'll probably want a spade, I find they're pretty much always needed when it comes to hunting treasure. Check the general store if you don't have one. If you need any extra help, just let me know.~|~translationMissing
Okay, thanks Veos.~|~translationMissing
I'm good thanks.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. Well now that you mention it, I could do with some help. The name's Veos. I'm a treasure hunter from the wonderous Kingdom of Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Hello Veos. What brings you to Lumbridge?~|~translationMissing
I'm here on a bit of a treasure hunt. Back in Kourend I came across a scroll. I believe it will lead me to something of great value.~|~translationMissing
Veos has given you a scroll.~|~translationMissing
You'll probably want a spade, I find they're pretty much always needed when it comes to hunting treasure. Check the general store if you don't have one.~|~translationMissing
I'll be sticking around here a little longer before heading back to my ship. If you need extra guidance with anything, just let me know and I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
Ready to help with this treasure hunt?~|~translationMissing
Hello Veos.~|~translationMissing
I came across this [scroll/orb]. Did you lose it by any chance?~|~translationMissing
Veos has given you a [scroll/orb].~|~translationMissing
I did, thanks Veos.~|~translationMissing
Not to worry. Just try to be careful with it.~|~translationMissing
How's the treasure hunt going?~|~translationMissing
I could do with some extra help.~|~translationMissing
You show the scroll to Veos.~|~translationMissing
This is the scroll I gave you. I don't know how to solve it I'm afraid. Maybe look for someone named Bob?~|~translationMissing
If the player talks to Veos in Lumbridge~|~translationMissing
Well keep at it. Once you've found the treasure, meet me at my ship. It's docked at the northernmost pier in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
If the player talks to Veos in Port Sarim~|~translationMissing
Well keep at it. Once you've found the treasure, bring it to me.~|~translationMissing
Looks like a map to me. I'd assume the X marks where you need to go.~|~translationMissing
You show the orb to Veos.~|~translationMissing
Interesting, these are quite rare. They work using temperature. The closer you are, the hotter the orb.~|~translationMissing
Ah a cipher, I've seen these before. Try shifting the letters to the left or right. That normally works.~|~translationMissing
You dig up an Ancient Casket. As you do, you hear a faint whispering. You can't make out what it says though...~|~translationMissing
Hmmmm... Must have been the wind.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, this must be the treasure that Veos is after. I should take it to him. If I remember right, he's docked at the northernmost pier in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
I don't think Veos would want me to open his treasure. I should take it to him. If I remember right, it's docked at the northernmost pier in Port Sarim.~|~translationMissing
I found the treasure!~|~translationMissing
Excellent. I'll take it off your hands now.~|~translationMissing
You give Veos the Ancient Casket.~|~translationMissing
Brilliant. This is just what I was looking for. Thank you so much for your help.~|~translationMissing
No problem. So what is this treasure anyway?~|~translationMissing
Oh err... nothing important. Just something that might be of use to me back in Great Kourend.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, as promised, a reward for you.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'd best be getting back to Great Kourend. I'm sure I'll be back here before long though, there's always more treasure to be found.~|~translationMissing
If you ever fancy visiting the kingdom, come find me here. I'm more than happy to take you there. Consider it an extra thank you for your help.~|~translationMissing
Sounds great, thanks Veos.~|~translationMissing

You don't have enough room in your inventory for the contents of this bag.~|~translationMissing
Just before you open the backpack, you notice a small leather patch with the moniker~|~translationMissing
'B.Vahn', on it.~|~translationMissing
You find an interesting looking tankard.~|~translationMissing
You find a knife and some rotten food, the backpack is ripped to shreds.~|~translationMissing
You find a knife and some rotten food.~|~translationMissing
You search the coffin and find a small geometrically shaped hole in the side. It looks as if this hole was made with a considerable amount of force, maybe the thing which made the hole is still inside?~|~translationMissing
The lock looks quite crude, with some skill and a slender blade, you may be able to force it.~|~translationMissing
With some skill you manage to slide the blade along the lock edge and click into place the teeth of the primitive mechanism.~|~translationMissing
You start to lift the lid and see something inside, but you have no space in your inventory to store the item.~|~translationMissing
The lid looks heavy, but now that you've unlocked it, you may be able to lift it. You prepare yourself.~|~translationMissing
Urrrgggg.~|~translationMissing
Aarrrgghhh!~|~translationMissing
You struggle, but just get weakened from your experience. Perhaps you should try again after you've recovered from the effort?~|~translationMissing
Raarrrggggg! Yes!~|~translationMissing
You eventually manage to lift the lid.~|~translationMissing
You find a creepy looking black prism inside.~|~translationMissing
You don't manage to understand all of it as there is only a half page here. But it seems the spell was used to place a curse on an area and for all time raise the dead.~|~translationMissing
If you look very carefully, you see what looks like a guild emblem.~|~translationMissing
A stout ceramic tankard with a Dragon Emblem on the side, the words, 'Ye Olde Dragon Inn' are inscribed in the bottom.~|~translationMissing
It looks like a smokey black gem of some sort...very creepy. Some magical force must have prevented it from being shattered when it hit the coffin.~|~translationMissing
You show the tankard to Grish.~|~translationMissing
I found this tankard in the tomb, have you got any suggestions?~|~translationMissing
Das a good drinker for da drinkies dat un is...is a small-un for Grish so yous creature keeps it yes. Yous creature keeps da fimble drinkers for da smaller drinkies.~|~translationMissing

You show the tankard to the Inn Keeper.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I found this tankard in an ogre tomb cavern. It has the emblem of this Inn on it and I wondered if you knew anything about it?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, this is Brentle's mug...I'm surprised he left it just lying around down some cave. He's quite protective of it.~|~translationMissing
Brentle you say? So you knew him then?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, this belongs to 'Brentle Vahn', he's quite a common customer, though I've not seen him in a while.~|~translationMissing
He was talking to some shifty looking wizard the other day. I don't know his name, but I'd recognise him if I saw him.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, I'm sorry to tell you this, but Brentle Vahn is dead - I believe he was murdered.~|~translationMissing
Noooo! I'm shocked...~|~translationMissing
...but not surprised. He was a good customer...but I knew he would sell his sword arm and do many a dark deed if paid enough.~|~translationMissing
If you need help bringing the culprit to justice, you let me know.~|~translationMissing
Hello again. Can you tell me what you know about this tankard again please?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, Brentle's tankard. Yeah, you've shown me this already. It belonged to Brentle Vahn, he was quite a common customer, though I've not seen him in a while.~|~translationMissing
Continues above from "He was talking to some shifty looking wizard the other day. I don't know his name, but I'd recognise him if I saw him."~|~translationMissing
You show the bar tender the torn page.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any clue what this might be?~|~translationMissing
Oooh, don't show me that sort of stuff, it's probably all magical and wizardy, probably turn me into a frog as soon as I look at it...~|~translationMissing
You show the bar tender the black prism.~|~translationMissing
Hello there, I found this black prism, I wondered if you knew anything about it.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, it's not really familiar to me, sorry I don't know what it's for, looks magical to me...maybe someone else in Yanille can help you?~|~translationMissing
Sithik Ints~|~translationMissing

You show the black prism to Sithik.~|~translationMissing
Err..it looks sort of familiar, did you steal it from me? Come to think of it, you have the appearance of a common thief!~|~translationMissing
I found it in a place called Jiggig where some undead ogres happen to be wandering around.~|~translationMissing
Oh, nothing to do with me then, never seen it in my life before!~|~translationMissing
Have you ever seen anything like this before?~|~translationMissing
You show the torn page to Sithik.~|~translationMissing
It's probably a piece of rubbish someone threw away...what does it say, I can't read it?~|~translationMissing
You should be able to read it, it's been torn from a book on necromancy and you're meant to be a specialist in the subject.~|~translationMissing
Oh, no..., not really a specialist, just a hobby of mine really. Hardly know anything about it, but it does seem interesting...~|~translationMissing
What about this then? Guess where I found this?~|~translationMissing
You show the tankard to Sithik.~|~translationMissing
You probably found it at the local brewhouse! It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out.~|~translationMissing
Aha! But I found this in an old ogre tomb! I suspect it's a clue which will lead me to the suspect.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well that eliminates all the local people who don't actually drink at the 'Dragon Inn'. When do you think you'll start questioning the remaining population of Yanille?~|~translationMissing
Hey! What do you think you're doing?~|~translationMissing
Erk! I'd better not start rifling through peoples things without permission.~|~translationMissing
Hey! What do you think you're doing? Leave my tea alone!~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Black prism but not the Torn page~|~translationMissing
There's some undead ogre activity over at 'Jiggig', and the ogres have asked me to look into it. I think I've found a clue and I wonder if you could take a look at it for me?~|~translationMissing
You show the black prism to the aged wizard.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well this is an uncommon spell component. On its own it's useless, but with certain necromantic spells it can be very powerful. Did you find anything else there?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Dragon inn tankard~|~translationMissing
You show the tankard to Zavistic.~|~translationMissing
Well, I found this...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, no, that's not really associated with this to be honest. Did you find anything else there?~|~translationMissing
I don't know what to say then, there isn't enough to go on with the clues you've shown me so far. I'd suggest going back to search a bit more, but you may just be wasting your time?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, but this prism does seem to have some magical protection. Once you've finished with this item, bring it back to me would you? I may have a reward for you!~|~translationMissing
Sure...I mean, I'll try if I remember.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Torn page but not the Black prism~|~translationMissing
There's some undead ogre activity over at Jiggig, I've found a clue that you may be able to help with.~|~translationMissing
You show the necromantic half page to the aged wizard.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, this is a half torn spell page, it requires another spell component to be effective. Did you find anything else there?~|~translationMissing
If the player has the Black prism and Torn page~|~translationMissing
There's some undead ogre activity over at Jiggig, I've found some clues, I wondered if you'd have a look at them.~|~translationMissing
You show the prism and the necromantic half page to the aged wizard.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, now this is interesting! Where did you get these from?~|~translationMissing
I got them from a nearby Ogre tomb, it's recently been infested with zombie ogres and I'm trying to work out what happened there.~|~translationMissing
This is very troubling [player name], very troubling indeed. While it's permitted for learned members of our order to research the 'dark arts', it's absolutely forbidden to make use of such magic.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any leads on people that I might talk to regarding this?~|~translationMissing
Well a wizard by the name of 'Sithik Ints' was doing some research in this area. He may know something about it. He's lodged at that guest house to the North, though he's ill and isn't able to leave his room.~|~translationMissing
Why not go and talk to him, poke around a bit and see if anything comes up. Let me know how you get on. However, I doubt that 'Sithik' had anything to do with it.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that black prism seems to have some magical protection. Once you've finished with this item, bring it back to me would you. I may have a reward for you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has started The Hand in the Sand~|~translationMissing
I'm here about the sicks...err Zogres~|~translationMissing
Continues above from "There's some undead ogre activity..."~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I have a rather sandy problem that I'd like to palm off on you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not started The Hand in the Sand~|~translationMissing
I found this black prism at Jiggig where the undead ogre activity was happening?~|~translationMissing
Yes, you've already showed me that, bring it to me when you've resolved the problems at Jiggig and I'll see what I can do.~|~translationMissing
I think I've found a clue from the Jiggig area where the undead ogre activity is happening.~|~translationMissing
I don't know what to say then really, there isn't enough to go on here as it is. I'd suggest going back to search a bit more, but you may just be wasting your time.~|~translationMissing
Hey...who gave you permission to come in here!~|~translationMissing
Zavistic Rarve said that I could come and talk to you and ask you a few questions.~|~translationMissing
Oh, Zavistic...why...why would he send you to me?~|~translationMissing
Do you know anything about the undead ogres at Jiggig?~|~translationMissing
Er...undead ogres...no, sorry, no idea what you're talking about there.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, is that right...~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, yes it is. If I knew something, I'd tell you.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, dead ogres you say? How strange? That must be a strange sight?~|~translationMissing
Very well, if you don't know anything about it, you won't mind if I look around then?~|~translationMissing
Continues below from "Well,err....well, actually yes I do mind...it's my place and I don't want strangers going through my things."~|~translationMissing
What do you do?~|~translationMissing
I'm a scholarly student of the magical arts. When I was younger I used to be an adventurer, probably just like yourself. But I lost interest in the constant fighting, looting and gaining abilities.~|~translationMissing
Instead I decided to focus my attention and time to study the purer form of the lost arts.~|~translationMissing
The lost arts? What are they?~|~translationMissing
Ignorant people call them the 'dark arts'. I'm talking about Necromancy, the power to bring the dead back to life - the power of the gods! Surely the most awesome power known to man.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, well I guess I must be an ignorant person then, because bringing the dead back to life sounds very unnatural.~|~translationMissing
Do you mind if I look around?~|~translationMissing
If asking for the first time~|~translationMissing
Well,err....well, actually yes I do mind...it's my place and I don't want strangers going through my things.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm going to have a look around anyway, if you're not involved in this whole thing, you won't have anything to hide.~|~translationMissing
Why, if I was a few years younger I'd give you a good hiding!~|~translationMissing
I'm sure!~|~translationMissing
If asking him again~|~translationMissing
I've already told you that I do! But you'll probably just ignore me again!~|~translationMissing
Quite right!~|~translationMissing
You see an item in the wardrobe, but you don't have space to put it in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
You find a book on Philosophy written by the 'Human's Against Monsters' leader, Johanhus Albrect[sic].~|~translationMissing
You read this book for a while, it seems to be some sort of political manifesto about how the king doesn't do enough to safeguard the citizens of the realm from the monsters that still thrive within the borders. It sends out a rallying cry to all people who would want to stop monsters, to join the HAM movement.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, Sithik must really hate monsters then, I wonder if he hates ogres in particular?~|~translationMissing
What's this then?~|~translationMissing
You show the HAM book to Sithik.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean? It's a book by the respected HAM leader Johanhus Ulsbrecht, that man speaks for a lot of people who are unhappy with the current state of affairs.~|~translationMissing
Can you honestly tell me that you've not had to fight for your life against the odd monster or two?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that may be true, but I don't universally hate all monsters, whereas I have a sneaking suspicion that you do...and ogres in particular!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that's an interesting theory, care to back it up with any facts?~|~translationMissing
You see an item in the cupboard, but you don't have space to put it in your inventory.~|~translationMissing
You find a book on Necromancy.~|~translationMissing
This book uses very strange language and some incomprehensible symbols. It has a very dark feeling to it. As you're loooking through the book, you notice that one of the pages has been torn and half of it is missing.~|~translationMissing
Aha! A necromantic book! What's this doing here then?~|~translationMissing
You show the Necromantic book to Sithik.~|~translationMissing
Oh..I'm not quite sure actually...where did you find that then?~|~translationMissing
I found it in this cupboard! What do you have to say for yourself?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, that's right...I remember now. It's for my research, there's nothing really dangerous about it, unless it falls into the wrong hands. I'm sure it's pretty safe with me.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, likely story!~|~translationMissing
You see some items in the drawer, but you need 3 free inventory spaces to take them.~|~translationMissing
If the player has papyrus but not charcoal~|~translationMissing
You find some papyrus.~|~translationMissing
If the player has charcoal but not papyrus~|~translationMissing
You find some charcoal.~|~translationMissing
If the player has neither~|~translationMissing
You find some charcoal and papyrus.~|~translationMissing
You also find a book on portaiture[sic].~|~translationMissing
All interested artisans should really consider taking up the hobby of portraiture. To do so, one uses a piece of papyrus on the intended subject to initiate a likeness drawing activity.~|~translationMissing
Oh, so explain this then?~|~translationMissing
You show the book on portraiture to Sithik.~|~translationMissing
It's my hobby...I'm interested in portraiture, but all art in general. It's fun, you should try it.~|~translationMissing
How do I do it...~|~translationMissing
Well...you could start by reading the book!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have charcoal~|~translationMissing
You have no charcoal with which to sketch this subject.~|~translationMissing
If the player has charcoal~|~translationMissing
Oh lovely! You're making my portrait! Let me see it afterwards!~|~translationMissing
You begin sketching the irritable Sithik.~|~translationMissing
If the player fails at painting~|~translationMissing
You get a portrait of Sithik.~|~translationMissing
If the player succeeds at painting~|~translationMissing
Here you go, what do you think?~|~translationMissing
You show the sketch...~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well it's an interesting interpretation, but not really classic realist representation is it? It's not my favourite, but I like the 'truth' of the work...well done.~|~translationMissing
You show the portrait to Sithik.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well it's not the most flattering of portraits, but I like the 'honesty' of the work...well done.~|~translationMissing
Look, I made a portrait of Sithik.~|~translationMissing
Who the demonikin is that? Is it meant to be a portrait of Sithik, it doesn't look anything like him!~|~translationMissing
You show the portrait of Sithik to Zavistic.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, great...but I already know what he looks like!~|~translationMissing
You show the sketch to the Inn keeper.~|~translationMissing
Who's that? I mean, I guess it's a picture of a person isn't it? Sorry...you've got me? And before you ask, you're not putting it up on my wall!~|~translationMissing
It's a portrait of Sithik Ints...don't you recognise him?~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I really am, but I just don't see it...can you make a better picture?~|~translationMissing
You show the portrait to the Inn keeper.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, that's the guy who was talking to Brentle Vahn the other day! Look at those eyes, never a more shifty looking pair will you ever see!~|~translationMissing
Hmm, you've just identified the man who I think sent Brentle Vahn to his death.~|~translationMissing
I'm trying to bring him to justice with the Wizards' Guild grand secretary. Do you think you could sign this portrait to say that he was talking to Brentle Vahn.~|~translationMissing
I can and I will!~|~translationMissing
The Dragon Inn bartender signs the portrait.~|~translationMissing
Many thanks for your help, it's really very good of you.~|~translationMissing
Not at all, just doing my part.~|~translationMissing
You see an image of Sithik with a message underneath 'I, the bartender of the Dragon Inn, do swear that this is a true likeness of the wizzy who was talking to Brentle Vahn, my customer the other day.'~|~translationMissing
Hey, what do you think of this? I'm going to show it to Zavistic and you're going to be in trouble!~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well, I've got quite a common looking face, I'm often mistaken for other wizards, you know, when I'm wearing my wizard's hat, robes and staff. There's a lot of us around here you know.~|~translationMissing
I don't think so! This is a signed picture of you, someone recognised you, you're in deep trouble!~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll pay you to keep this secret - how much do you want for the picture?~|~translationMissing
You can't buy me Sithik!~|~translationMissing
Ok, let's say two million...two million to keep quiet and give me the picture.~|~translationMissing
Sithik shows you a chest brimming over with coins...~|~translationMissing
Oh...erm...well, that is a lot of money actually...er....~|~translationMissing
Yes, and you deserve it, you're very clever! Now, take the money...~|~translationMissing
Be bribed by Sithik for 2 million?~|~translationMissing
No, I won't take the money, I'm going to bring you to justice!~|~translationMissing
Oh well, suit yourself! I wasn't going to give you the money anyway! No one will believe some crazy adventurer and an Inn keep.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll shut up for two million!~|~translationMissing
Ha! Ha! You believed me! I'm not going to give you all my money! No one will believe a crazy adventurer and a local Inn keep!~|~translationMissing
You're a mean and cruel man Sithik, a mean and cruel man!~|~translationMissing
What did you say I should do?~|~translationMissing
You should go and have a chat with Sithik Ints, he's in that house just to the north. He's a lodger and has a room upstairs. Just tell him that I sent you to see him. He should be fine once you've mentioned my name.~|~translationMissing
Where is Sithik?~|~translationMissing
He's in that house just to the north, less than a few seconds walk away. He's a lodger and has a room upstairs...he's not very well though.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has one item~|~translationMissing
) I have an item that I'd like you to look at.~|~translationMissing
I have an item that I'd like you to look at.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has multiple items~|~translationMissing
) I have some items that I'd like you to look at.~|~translationMissing
I have some items that I'd like you to look at.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the necromancy book~|~translationMissing
You show the Necromancy book to Zavistic.~|~translationMissing
I have this necromancy book as evidence that Sithik is involved with the undead ogres at Jiggig.~|~translationMissing
If the player has shown Zavistic the necromancy book before~|~translationMissing
Yeah, you've shown me this before...if this is all the evidence you have?~|~translationMissing
Please just look at it again...~|~translationMissing
Ok, let me look then.~|~translationMissing
Ok, so he's researching necromancy...it doesn't mean anything in itself.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but if you look, you can see that there is a half torn page which matches the page I found at Jiggig.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, yes, but someone could have stolen that from him and then gone and cast it without his permission or to try and deliberately implicate him.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the book of 'h.a.m'~|~translationMissing
You show the HAM book to Zavistic.~|~translationMissing
Look, this book proves that Sithik hates all monsters and most likely Ogres with a passion.~|~translationMissing
If the player has shown Zavistic the book of 'h.a.m' before~|~translationMissing
So what, hating monsters isn't a crime in itself...although I suppose that it does give a motive if Sithik was involved. On its own, it's not enough evidence though.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the dragon inn tankard~|~translationMissing
You show the dragon[sic] Inn Tankard to Zavistic.~|~translationMissing
This is the tankard I found on the remains of Brentle Vahn!~|~translationMissing
If the player has shown Zavistic the Dragon Inn tankard before~|~translationMissing
That doesn't mean anything in itself, you could have gotten that from anywhere. Even from the Dragon Inn tavern! There isn't anything to link Brentle Vahn with Sithik Ints.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the signed portrait~|~translationMissing
You show the signed portrait of Sithik to Zavistic.~|~translationMissing
This is a portrait of Sithik, signed by the landlord of the Dragon Inn saying that he saw Sithik and Brentle Vahn together.~|~translationMissing
If the player has shown Zavistic the signed portrait before~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, well that is interesting.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet shown all 4 pieces of evidence~|~translationMissing
However, there isn't enough evidence for me to take the issue further at this point. If you find any further evidence bring it to me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has shown all 4 pieces of evidence~|~translationMissing
And I'm starting to think that Sithik may be involved. Here, take this potion and give some to Sithik. It'll bring on a change which should solicit some answers - tell him the effects won't revert until he's told the truth.~|~translationMissing
Zavistic hands you a strange looking potion bottle and takes all the evidence you've accumulated so far.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I want to ask about the Magic Guild.~|~translationMissing
(If the player is partly through The Hand in the Sand~|~translationMissing
) (Non-quest dialogue) I have a rather sandy problem that I'd like to palm off on you.~|~translationMissing
Have you used that potion yet?~|~translationMissing
If the player has lost the potion~|~translationMissing
Well, actually, I've lost it, could I have another one please?~|~translationMissing
Sure, but don't lose it this time.~|~translationMissing
Zavistic hands you a bottle of strange potion.~|~translationMissing
No, not yet, what was I supposed to do again?~|~translationMissing
Try to use the potion on Sithik somehow, he should undergo an interesting transformation, though you'll probably want to leave the house in case there are any side effects. Then go back and question Sithik and tell~|~translationMissing
him the effects won't wear off until he tells the truth. In fact, that's not exactly true, but I'm sure it'll be an extra incentive to get him to be honest.~|~translationMissing
What is there to do in the Wizards' Guild?~|~translationMissing
What are the requirements to get in the Wizards' Guild?~|~translationMissing
What do you do in the Guild?~|~translationMissing
Hey there's no need to be rude!~|~translationMissing
What do you expect when you just go snooping around a person's place against their express permission.~|~translationMissing
Why do you spend most of your time in bed?~|~translationMissing
I'm actually quite old and not so very well and I'd like to get over this illness I have, then I'll return to my very serious and important studies.~|~translationMissing
You search but find nothing of significance.~|~translationMissing
Here, try some of this potion, it'll make you feel better!~|~translationMissing
Err, yuck....no way am I taking any potions or medication off you...I don't trust you!~|~translationMissing
You pour some of the potion into the cup. Zavistic said it may take some time to have an effect.~|~translationMissing
Arghhhh..what's happened to me...you beast!~|~translationMissing
It's your own fault, you shouldn't have lied about your involvement with the undead Ogres at Jiggig. The potion will wear off once you've told the truth!~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok, I admit it, I got Brentle Vahn to cast the spell to put an end to those awful Ogres...they're just disgusting creatures...~|~translationMissing
Ok, that's a start...now I want some answers.~|~translationMissing
How do I remove the effects of the spell from the area?~|~translationMissing
How do I remove the effects of the spell from the area? The ogres want to get their ceremonial dance area back and can't do that with undead walking all over it.~|~translationMissing
Asking for the first time~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately you can't. The spell is permanent, it will last forever, the only option you have is to move the ceremonial area.~|~translationMissing
You're an evil man and I'm going to make you pay for this...you can stay like that forever as far as I'm concerned.~|~translationMissing
No...no, let me try to make amends...please I can help you. Just don't leave me like this.~|~translationMissing
Asking him again~|~translationMissing
Haven't I told you this already? You can't remove the spell, it's permanent, it will last forever, the only option you have is to move the ceremonial area.~|~translationMissing
How do I get rid of the undead ogres?~|~translationMissing
Ok, similar spells have been cast before and the only way to deal with the resulting creatures is to cordon off the area and not go in there again.~|~translationMissing
The undead creatures usually manifest some sort of disease so it's best to attack them from a distance with a ranged weapon.~|~translationMissing
Normal missiles like arrows and darts do very little damage to them because they're designed to destroy internal organs. This is a waste of time with undead creatures like undead ogres.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, clearly so what should we use?~|~translationMissing
From my research it looks like a flat ended arrow was designed called a 'Brutal arrow'. This does large amounts of crushing damage to the creature. You can make them by using larger arrows.~|~translationMissing
I think some Ogre hunters make them. But instead of adding an arrow tip, you hammer a large nail into the end of the shaft.~|~translationMissing
Haven't I already explained this to you once before?~|~translationMissing
Humour me!~|~translationMissing
(Continues with "Ok, similar spells...")~|~translationMissing
How do I get rid of the disease?~|~translationMissing
My research shows that two jungle based herbs can be used, one is found near river tributaries and looks like a vine, the other is found in caves and grows on the wall.~|~translationMissing
It's quite well camouflaged so it's unlikely that you'll find it.~|~translationMissing
Asking him again as an ogre~|~translationMissing
Haven't I already explained this disease thing to you once before?~|~translationMissing
Just tell me again or else I'll never turn you back into a human!~|~translationMissing
No...noo...please, I'll tell you.~|~translationMissing
(Continues with "My research shows...")~|~translationMissing
Asking him again as a human~|~translationMissing
Just tell me again or I'll turn you back into an ogre.~|~translationMissing
But...you can't just leave me here like this!~|~translationMissing
Arghhhh..what do you want now...you've turned me into a beast!~|~translationMissing
I've got some questions for you...and you'd better answer them well or else!~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok, I'll tell you anything, just turn me back into a human again!~|~translationMissing
Don't you worry about Sithik, he's not likely to be moving from his bed for a long time. When he eventually does get better, he's going to be sent before a disciplinary tribunal, then we'll sort out what's what.~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help with all of this.~|~translationMissing
Ooohh, no thanks required. It's I who should be thanking you my friend...your investigative mind has shown how vigilant we really should be for this type of evil use of the magical arts.~|~translationMissing
You show the potion to Uglug Nar.~|~translationMissing
Hey, here you go! I brought you some of the potion which should cure the disease. You said that you would buy some from me.~|~translationMissing
Uglug Nar~|~translationMissing
Yous creatures done da good fing...yous get many bright pretties for dis...!~|~translationMissing
You sell the potion and get 650 coins in return.~|~translationMissing
Yous creature dun da fing yet? Da zogries going in da ground?~|~translationMissing
I found who's responsible for the Zogres being here.~|~translationMissing
Where is da creature? Me's wants to squeeze him till he's a deadun...~|~translationMissing
The person responsible is a wizard named 'Sithik Ints' and he's going to be in serious trouble. He told me that the spell which raised the zogres from the ground will last forever.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to say, but you'll have to move the site of your ceremonial dancing somewhere else.~|~translationMissing
Dat is da bad fing creature...we's needs new Jiggig for da fallin' down jig.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's right, you'll need to create a new ceremonial dance area.~|~translationMissing
Urghhh...not good fing creature, yous gotta get da ogrish old fings for da making new jiggig special. You's creature needs da key for getting in da low bury place.~|~translationMissing
Grish gives you a crudely crafted key.~|~translationMissing
Oh, so you want me to go back in there and look for something for you?~|~translationMissing
Yeah creature, yous gotta get da ogrish old fings for da making new jiggig and proper in da special way.~|~translationMissing
I've got some information on how to kill the zogres from a distance.~|~translationMissing
Sithik told me how to make Brutal arrows which means I can kill these zogres from a distance!~|~translationMissing
Uhggh, whas you's sayin' creature? Yous speakies too stupid for Grish...~|~translationMissing
I know how to make large arrows...you know, 'big stabbers', to kill the zogres...they're bigger and apparently do a lot of damage, only thing is, the normal ogre bow I need to fire it is quite slow.~|~translationMissing
Why you's not say so creature...me's shows you how to make da bigger stabber chucker... ~ Grish gets a couple of items out of his back pack.~~|~translationMissing
De're creature...now yous is makin' da bigga stabber chucker...~|~translationMissing
Thanks! I think....~|~translationMissing
I've found out how to cure the disease.~|~translationMissing
I also found out that the disease can be cured.~|~translationMissing
Dat's da good fing creature, yous do good fing to give un to Uglug...he gives bright pretties for da sickies glug glug..~|~translationMissing
I have some other questions for you.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes creatures...what's other fings yous wanna know?~|~translationMissing
Why are you much nicer than the Shaman in Gu'Tanoth?~|~translationMissing
Dey's is da big crazy one's! Dey's biggest angries wiv fings and wanna dead all fings...dey's gotten da biggies wizzy stuff...and dey's wanna eat yous creatures...Grish, not do dat...~|~translationMissing
Oh, well that's a relief! It's good to know you don't eat humans...~|~translationMissing
Grish not say dat! Me's want's tasty looking creatures for yums...you's looks like da sickies chompy...not good for da gutsies...~|~translationMissing
Gulp!~|~translationMissing
Grish, you's is fright da creatures! Leave it alone!~|~translationMissing
But it's da big laffsies when it's facey goes to whiteness....ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
But it's not da big yumsies when it's gone to all frighty...~|~translationMissing
ha ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
Yeah...very funny, I'm sure.~|~translationMissing
Do you know Rantz?~|~translationMissing
Me's know's about Rantz, he's da biggun chompy hunter..he finks...ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
He's da bad shot chompy sticker, no good at sneaky, sneaky part, he's more gooder at da 'noisy, noisy miss da chompy', ha ha ha!~|~translationMissing
Why doesn't Rantz live with the rest of the Ogres?~|~translationMissing
He's been leaving Gu 'Noth 'cos dey's peoples is da big stressy dere? All da ogries is busying all da time...not doin' no good for da healfy fing. Rantz is da brave-un tho! He's got da big secret fing for leaving Gu' Noth~|~translationMissing
but me's not knowin it. But maybe's he's just want's to be da better chompy sticker?~|~translationMissing
Why do you call this place Jiggig?~|~translationMissing
It's da place where da Jiggig is done...we's jig at Jiggig...~|~translationMissing
I want to talk about the quest.~|~translationMissing
I want to talk about the quest~|~translationMissing
Yous creature got da old fings yet?~|~translationMissing
I've lost the key you gave me!~|~translationMissing
Yous stupid creatures....luckily Grish has 'nother one..~|~translationMissing
Yous creatures doesn't loosing this ones.~|~translationMissing
Grish asks if you have the items yet.~|~translationMissing
Nope, not yet.~|~translationMissing
Yous gets 'em quick tho, cos we'ze wonna do da new Jiggig place...~|~translationMissing
There must be an easier way to kill these zogres!~|~translationMissing
Grish shows you he has Achey tree logs and wolf bones, he starts to whittle away at them both with a knife.~|~translationMissing

Ah, good day to you [milady/sirrah]! Your face is unfamiliar, did you perhaps join us aboard the ship at Lunar Isle?~|~translationMissing
No, Lokar offered me a lift in Rellekka actually.~|~translationMissing
Oh, really? You don't look like a Fremennik to me!~|~translationMissing
Well... I kind of am, and I kind of aren't. It's a long story.~|~translationMissing
Sorry I don't have time to hear it then! See you around young fremennik-who-is-not-really-a-fremennik!~|~translationMissing
'Bye.~|~translationMissing
Aren't you a little short for a pirate?~|~translationMissing
My mother was a gnome. Apparently it was a very painful birth.~|~translationMissing
More info than I wanted, thanks!~|~translationMissing
ARGH! SOUND THE ALARM! STOWAWAY ON BOARD! STOWAWAY ON BOARD!~|~translationMissing
No! I'm not a stowaway! Honest! I was invited here!~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry, my mistake then.~|~translationMissing
You must admit you do look a lot like a stowaway though.~|~translationMissing
Why, what do they usually look like?~|~translationMissing
Erm... I've never actually met one...~|~translationMissing
Brrrr! Its cold up here!~|~translationMissing
You think this is cold? Up by Acheron it gets so cold that when you talk you see the words freeze in the air in front of you!~|~translationMissing
REALLY?~|~translationMissing
Nah, not really. I was exaggerating for humourous effect. It is very very cold though!~|~translationMissing
So... You're a pirate, huh?~|~translationMissing
It's what it says on my pay-packet at the end of the month.~|~translationMissing
How's that working out for you?~|~translationMissing
Pretty good so far. All the grog and loot that we can plunder, plus full medical including dental.~|~translationMissing
You mean you have insurance?~|~translationMissing
Not as such. If any of us get sick we kidnap a doctor and don't let him go until we're better.~|~translationMissing
You'd be surprised what an incentive for expert health care that is.~|~translationMissing
I can imagine.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. So what brings you aboard the Lady Zay?~|~translationMissing
Well, I was planning on visiting the Moon Clan, but I have to say your ship is very impressive.~|~translationMissing
Aye, she's a beauty alright! The Lady Zay has been my home for many hard months, through storm and sun, and she always gets us to here we were headed!~|~translationMissing
Yes, she's certainly one of the finest boats I've seen on my travels!~|~translationMissing
That she is [lad/lass], that she is.~|~translationMissing
Hello to you too.~|~translationMissing
Yar! We be pirates, yar! Avast, ye scurvy land-lubbing lychee!~|~translationMissing
Please don't talk like that, it is extremely irritating.~|~translationMissing
Also, please don't call me a lychee, whatever that may be.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Okay. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
So how's life as a pirate?~|~translationMissing
What kind of question is that? How's life as a... I dunno. Whatever it is that you do for a living.~|~translationMissing
I'm a freelance troubleshooter.~|~translationMissing
What does that entail then?~|~translationMissing
Mostly killing things for money and delivering items around the planet for people.~|~translationMissing
I collect stuff.~|~translationMissing
So how's that life?~|~translationMissing
Can't complain, can't complain...~|~translationMissing
Well, there you go.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, can't stop, the Captain will have my guts for garters if he catches me slacking off talking to the stowaway.~|~translationMissing
I'm not a stowaway! I was invited aboard!~|~translationMissing
Yeah, whatever [guy/lady], it doesn't really matter who you are I'll get in trouble!~|~translationMissing
You know, I've always wondered what life as a pirate actually entails.~|~translationMissing
Well, at the moment it mostly involves being asked random questions by a stowaway.~|~translationMissing
I'm not a stowaway! I was invited aboard! By Lokar! Ask him!~|~translationMissing
Hey, whatever [love/pal]. Just make sure the captain doesn't catch you, pirates don't like stowaways much.~|~translationMissing

1v1 Tournament Guide~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the Emir's Arena! Are you interested in 1v1 Tournaments? We organise ranked Tournaments here, or alternatively you can organise your own unranked Tournaments.~|~translationMissing
What's a 1v1 Tournament?~|~translationMissing
A group of fighters is divided into pairs of opponents, and they all fight their opponent. The winners of those fights proceed to the next round, where they're divided into pairs, and they each fight their new opponent.~|~translationMissing
The number of surviving fighters is halved each time, until eventually only one person is left standing. They're the winner of the Tournament.~|~translationMissing
Ranked or unranked? What does that mean?~|~translationMissing
Everyone has a rank. It's meant to indicate how good they are at fighting, compared to other people.~|~translationMissing
In ranked fights, the winners gain rank and the losers lose rank. The Arena staff will decide who'll be fighting in each ranked Tournament, and send the invitations.~|~translationMissing
But if you just want some casual fun, you can have an unranked Tournament, where no-one gains or loses rank. You can organise your own unranked Tournament, and decide for yourself who'll fight in it.~|~translationMissing
Only the ranked fights offer access to the other rewards of the Arena.~|~translationMissing
How do I get invited into a Tournament?~|~translationMissing
You'll need to sign up to a recruitment group...~|~translationMissing
This is the icon for the Grouping tab. Within it you'll find the PvP Arena options.~|~translationMissing
There, you can click Find to seek the official group for ranked Tournaments. Alternatively, you could look for another player's group, for an unranked Tournament.~|~translationMissing
Once you've found a suitable group for you, click Sign up to sign up to it, and you'll be considered for an invitation to a Tournament, whenever one begins.~|~translationMissing
You can carry on with your adventures while you're waiting for a Tournament to begin, since it may be a while before suitable fighters are available.~|~translationMissing
I want to organise my own Tournament.~|~translationMissing
Just use my Recruitment Board here to form your own recruitment group. Once you've got one, wait for other fighters to join it.~|~translationMissing
This is the icon for the Grouping tab. Once you've formed a recruitment group, you'll be able to control it there, via the PvP Arena options.~|~translationMissing
When you're ready to start, click Start to summon your awaiting fighters. You'll need to be on a PvP Arena world  to start your Tournament.~|~translationMissing
I'm okay, thanks.~|~translationMissing

Arr! A landlubber!~|~translationMissing
Begone afore I take my cutlass to ye! I've been charged with guardin' this gate and no noodle-armed landlubbers will make it past me alive!~|~translationMissing
That's not a cutlass.~|~translationMissing
I think it's a twig.~|~translationMissing
Ye cheeky begger! I was wavin' my finger at ye!~|~translationMissing
Arrr... just 'cos me body happens to be 50% wood does not mean I'm heartless.~|~translationMissing
I got a bag of 'em here. Wanna see?~|~translationMissing
What happened to you?~|~translationMissing
If the player is not wearing a Ring of Charos~|~translationMissing
That be a tale so heart-wrenchin' that it has so far wrenched the hearts from over a dozen sturdier men than thee!~|~translationMissing
A tale of such woe that none but the stoniest hearts can hear it without sheddin' a single, poignant tear...~|~translationMissing
And I'll never tell ye, not even if ye wore an item, such as a ring, with powers of mind control!~|~translationMissing
What if I said please?~|~translationMissing
Hmmmm...well alright...~|~translationMissing
Wait, no!~|~translationMissing
Get goin' landlubber before I take my splintery foot to yer behind!~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing a Ring of Charos~|~translationMissing
Well ye seem like a [lad/lass] that can handle such a tale...so I'll tell ye...~|~translationMissing
Well, it all starts with this albatross...~|~translationMissing
Wait, never mind, I'll skip forward a bit.~|~translationMissing
I have to [lad/lass], Cap'n Donnie will flay what little is left of me if I told ye.~|~translationMissing
But anyway, I got recruited to the zombie pirates along with the rest of the crew in an unspecified incident involvin this albatross.~|~translationMissing
We was sailin' along happily, and I was partakin' of a little 'rum' in the crows nest.~|~translationMissing
Well, we hit either a really rough wave or some rocks.~|~translationMissing
Twas kind of hard for me to tell which, as I was well out of it by then!~|~translationMissing
Regardless I toppled from the crows nest into the water.~|~translationMissing
Is that how you got so badly injured?~|~translationMissing
No [lad/lass]!~|~translationMissing
What happened next was that I discovered a new, previously uncharted reef of hard, spiky coral.~|~translationMissing
I made a mental note of its location, and to this day it is still marked on our fleet's charts as Lukes Reef.~|~translationMissing
I managed to grab a hold of our ship, the Inebriated, as it passed overhead.~|~translationMissing
And then I discovered another, taller, spikier reef of even sharper and more painful coral.~|~translationMissing
To this day it is still marked on our fleet's charts as The Other 50% Reef.~|~translationMissing
Owwwwwwwww...~|~translationMissing
It gets worse...~|~translationMissing
When they hauled what was left of me on deck, they dropped me onto the floor while they decided what to do with me.~|~translationMissing
Bear in mind this would be on a ghost ship, the planks of which sweat a thick mixture of stagnant water...and pure salt crystals.~|~translationMissing
Oh...my...god...~|~translationMissing
But on the good side, all my thrashin' and pained squealin' settled the matter in the Captain's mind, and he had the shipwright carve me half a body out of his Witchwood Planks.~|~translationMissing
Witchwood? What's that?~|~translationMissing
Tis a special, magical wood from a now extinct tree.~|~translationMissing
Once they nailed it all in place the stuff moves like it is part of me body.~|~translationMissing
The stuff will also grow back if it breaks, which is dead handy!~|~translationMissing
Wow, that stuff must be very valuable!~|~translationMissing
Arr! That it be!~|~translationMissing
So, that be the tale of how I managed to lose precisely 50% of my body.~|~translationMissing
There there.~|~translationMissing
How flammable are you?~|~translationMissing
So how flammable are you?~|~translationMissing
What kind of a question is that?~|~translationMissing
A rather rude, personal one?~|~translationMissing
Ye've got that right!~|~translationMissing
I'll soon have you out of the way! Burn!~|~translationMissing
The player does the tinderbox lighting animation.~|~translationMissing
Don't make me angry! Ye'll not like me when I'm angry!~|~translationMissing
The screen turns black and a message appears saying "One 500 hit combo later..."~|~translationMissing
Let that be a lesson to ye!~|~translationMissing
My world is an ocean of paaaain!~|~translationMissing
So what is going on here anyway?~|~translationMissing
Ye expect me to talk?~|~translationMissing
No Mr. Luke, I expect you to die!~|~translationMissing
Hah! I'm one step ahead of ye!~|~translationMissing
Egad, outsmarted by the man with the wooden brain.~|~translationMissing
But seriously, what is going on here?~|~translationMissing
I can't tell ye [lad/lass].~|~translationMissing
The Cap'n would have me whittled down to toothpicks if I did.~|~translationMissing
Well if you can't tell me, perhaps you could show me through the medium of Interpretive Dance?~|~translationMissing
No. Just...no.~|~translationMissing
Mime?~|~translationMissing
Look, [lad/lass] I'm not tellin' ye a thing! So clear out while ye still can!~|~translationMissing
Starts above from "I'll soon have you out of the way! Burn!"~|~translationMissing
Who's that making faces behind you?~|~translationMissing
That is the most amazing thing I have ever seen!~|~translationMissing
Is that your distraction?~|~translationMissing
Who is that behind you?~|~translationMissing
Hey you! Look over there!~|~translationMissing
Oh my! Is that a genuine 3rd Age Diversion?~|~translationMissing
A'abla~|~translationMissing
Hi. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
Can you heal me?~|~translationMissing
If the player is on a PvP world~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I'm not on duty.~|~translationMissing
If the player is on a Deadman world~|~translationMissing
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!~|~translationMissing
I was... looking to be healed.~|~translationMissing
No way, I'm out of here just as soon as I've packed up my stuff!~|~translationMissing
If the player has full Hitpoints~|~translationMissing
You look healthy to me!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have full Hitpoints~|~translationMissing
A'abla heals you for 21 Hitpoints.~|~translationMissing
Do you see a lot of injured fighters?~|~translationMissing
Yes I do. Thankfully we can cope with almost anything. Jaraah really is a wonderful surgeon, his methods are a little unorthodox but he gets the job done.~|~translationMissing
I shouldn't tell you this but his nickname is 'The Butcher'.~|~translationMissing
That's reassuring.~|~translationMissing
Do you come here often?~|~translationMissing
I work here, so yes!~|~translationMissing
You're silly!~|~translationMissing

How do I get further into the monastery?~|~translationMissing

If the player does not have 31 prayer~|~translationMissing
No. I am sorry, but I feel you are not devout enough.~|~translationMissing
You need a prayer level of 31 to join the order.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 31 prayer~|~translationMissing
Ok, I see you are someone suitable for our order. You may join.~|~translationMissing
Can you help with spirit shields?~|~translationMissing
I might be able to... What did you have in mind?~|~translationMissing
Can you remove the sigils from my spirit shields?~|~translationMissing
I think I shoud be able to manage that. However in doing so, I'm afraid I'll have to destroy the blessed shield itself. You'll only get the sigil back.~|~translationMissing
I can go ahead and break down all of the shields in your inventory now if you'd like?.[sic]~|~translationMissing
Abbot Langley carefully breaks each shield, leaving the sigils perfectly intact.~|~translationMissing
Only members of our order can go up there.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I was told to expect you, please take this as thanks!~|~translationMissing
Abbot Langley quickly takes the soft clay, leather boots and bowl of hot water in exchange for a mysterious helmet.~|~translationMissing

Abigaila~|~translationMissing
What can I help you with, dear?~|~translationMissing
Who are you and what are you doing?~|~translationMissing
I'm Abigaila, from Morytania. It's a terrible place, run by the vampyres. They visit the towns and collect everyone's blood for food!~|~translationMissing
I tried for years to escape, with my son, Suro, to make a better life for ourselves in Misthalin. I scraped together enough money to bribe a boatman to get us out.~|~translationMissing
The journey was tough. Some men in pink hoods attacked our boat, shouting at us to go back where we belonged, and to keep out of their country. In the struggle, the boat overturned.~|~translationMissing
It was dark, and I couldn't find Suro in the water. I swam as deep as I could, until my lungs screamed, but I couldn't find him. He wasn't good at swimming.~|~translationMissing
Eventually I got myself to the shore. The sun was rising, and I found Suro there. On the shore, where the water had dumped his... body.~|~translationMissing
*sob*~|~translationMissing
I've done alright in Misthalin, I guess. I know a bit of magic, and the local gentry pay me well for my scrying skills. I'm good at turning a profit on Grand Exchange trades too.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'm able to rent a room in Lumbridge, and to buy food. I'm not being a burden on anyone, and there are no vampyres coming for my blood.~|~translationMissing
I am free!~|~translationMissing
But I haven't forgotten my people in the east. There's one vampyre there who runs a place she calls the Theatre of Blood, challenging humans to face monsters in her arena.~|~translationMissing
My husband went there, trying to win freedom from the blood-gatherers by surviving her arena, but he never returned. No-one does.~|~translationMissing
So now I pass my spare time scrying on the Theatre of Blood, watching other adventurers there. You can have a look, if you like.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to look in your scrying ball.~|~translationMissing
If the player is poisoned or diseased, or has anything equipped or in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I can't let you use my scrying ball now, dear. Clear out everything you're carrying, and make sure you're not sick or poisoned.~|~translationMissing

No, it's just scary~|~translationMissing
No, it's just scary.~|~translationMissing
Poor human. You must not judge THE ABYSS by the standards of this world. You must learn to embrace your fear as part of the experience of THE ABYSS.~|~translationMissing
I suppose fear does heighten the senses~|~translationMissing
I suppose fear does heighten the senses.~|~translationMissing
Then you should enhance them further by raising the stakes. Next time you go to THE ABYSS you should take all your most valuable items with you.~|~translationMissing
Could I get an abyssal whip?~|~translationMissing
You must take all your gold and all your most valued items, and take them into THE ABYSS without weapons or armour.~|~translationMissing
And then will I get an abyssal whip?~|~translationMissing
You'll get an ABYSSAL WHIPPING!~|~translationMissing
That pun was abyssmal.~|~translationMissing

Account Guide~|~translationMissing
I'm the Account Guide. I'm here to tell you about your account.~|~translationMissing
What's an account?~|~translationMissing
Your character IS your account! It's what you are using to play the game right now. Everyone here has one and some people even have multiple!~|~translationMissing
There?s various things you can do with your account which is where the Account Management menu comes into play. Let?s take a look at it now.~|~translationMissing
As you can see, there's a few things you can do with your account.~|~translationMissing
First, you have membership. All accounts are free to play by default but if you desire, you can buy membership to unlock members' worlds. These worlds give you access to extra skills, areas, quests, and more!~|~translationMissing
What's a world?~|~translationMissing
A world is what you play the game on. Each world can hold up to 2000 players and they are split into two main types, free worlds and members' worlds. You can swap worlds with the world switcher in the logout menu.~|~translationMissing
If the player is on a free world~|~translationMissing
You are currently on a free world. If you want to switch to a members? world and enjoy all of the benefits, you?ll need to purchase membership. You can do so using the store in the Account Management menu.~|~translationMissing
If the player is on a members world~|~translationMissing
You are currently on a members' world so you already have access to everything that being a member has to offer. Enjoy!~|~translationMissing
Bonds are another thing that you should know about. You can purchase Bonds from the store in the Account Management menu. Once you have some Bonds, you can redeem them for membership!~|~translationMissing
But why would I use a Bond instead of just buying membership normally?~|~translationMissing
Unlike membership, Bonds can be traded with other players. You could purchase a Bond and then sell it to another player for some gold. Alternatively, you could use your gold to buy a Bond from another player!~|~translationMissing
So if I used my gold to buy a Bond from another player, I could get membership without spending any real money?~|~translationMissing
Next up, you have your inbox and name changer. The inbox is where you?ll receive important information related to your account and the game. Be sure to keep an eye on it.~|~translationMissing
The name changer allows you to change your display name if you don't like your current one. Be aware though that this is only available to accounts with membership.~|~translationMissing
Finally, the bottom of the menu has some links which you might find useful. Make sure you check them out at some point.~|~translationMissing
Awesome. Is there anything else I should know about accounts?~|~translationMissing
Only this. Your account is very valuable and it's important you look after it. You have many tools at your disposal to help out with this such as bank pins and authenticators.~|~translationMissing
You?ll find more information on account security on the Customer Support webpage. You can use the useful links section of the Account Management menu to get there.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, that's everything I have to tell you about accounts. Let me know if you need a recap, otherwise head on to your next instructor.~|~translationMissing
Hello. Would you like to hear about your account again?~|~translationMissing
Excellent. Well there's a few things you can do with your account.~|~translationMissing
You are currently on a free world. If you want to switch to a members' world and enjoy all of the benefits, you'll need to purchase membership. You can do so using the store in the Account Management menu.~|~translationMissing
Next up, you have your inbox. The inbox is where you'll receive important information related to your account and the game. Be sure to keep an eye on it.~|~translationMissing
Finally, you have your display name. Every account has a unique display name. If you don't like your current one, you can change it with the name changer.~|~translationMissing
You'll find more information on account security on the Customer Support webpage. You can use the useful links section of the Account Management menu to get there.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, that's everything. I hope that has helped you out.~|~translationMissing
No Thanks~|~translationMissing

Account security tutor~|~translationMissing
Hey there adventurer. I am Gordon, the Account security tutor. I can help you with anything account security related, would you like to know anything?~|~translationMissing
How can I keep my account secure?~|~translationMissing
There are many ways you can strengthen your account security, which would you like to hear more about?~|~translationMissing
Tell me about passwords.~|~translationMissing
Your password is the first line of defence in keeping your account secure.~|~translationMissing
When choosing a password, make sure to keep it unique. You can do this by using a mix of letters and numbers. You could even use numbers in the middle of your password.~|~translationMissing
For extra security, you should make sure you use a different password for your account and email.~|~translationMissing
You should keep your password safe and tell no one. Not even your friends or family.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about securing my email.~|~translationMissing
Make sure you use a separate password for your email account. This will help boost your security and make it less likely for hijackers to steal your account.~|~translationMissing
You should also enable two-step authentication on your email account, if your email supports it.~|~translationMissing
This could be done through an authenticator app supplied by your email provider, or it could be done using your mobile phone number.~|~translationMissing
The type of authenticator changes based on provider, but when active, hijackers will find it hard to access your account. Also, if you get any backup codes, keep them safe.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the authenticator.~|~translationMissing
The RuneScape authenticator will provide your account with another layer of security against hijackers who might want to steal your account.~|~translationMissing
As well as requiring a password to enter your account, you will also need a randomly generated number from the authenticator app to login.~|~translationMissing
You can enable the authenticator by checking your account page on the official RuneScape website.~|~translationMissing
If you like, I can take you to a useful web page about the RuneScape authenticator.~|~translationMissing
Take me to the web page.~|~translationMissing
The player's default browser will open this web page.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about securing my bank.~|~translationMissing
If someone does get into your account, you should make sure your bank is secure.~|~translationMissing
To keep your bank secure, you should make sure to set a bank pin. A bank pin is a 4 digit code you will need to put in to access your bank.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a Bank PIN set up~|~translationMissing
It seems I don't have one setup. How do I got[sic] about setting up a bank pin?~|~translationMissing
To setup a bank pin you will need to visit any bank where you can find a banker. You should then speak to the banker and ask them about setting up a bank pin.~|~translationMissing
After the bank pin has been set, you will need to wait a few days for the pin to take effect.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I should go speak to a banker right away.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Bank PIN set up~|~translationMissing
Good thing I already have one set.~|~translationMissing
Good on you [lad/lass]! Great work.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Stronghold of Security.~|~translationMissing
The Stronghold of Security can be found in the Barbarian Village, west of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Here you will be tested on your knowledge of account security. You will need to make your way to the bottom floor while answering question on account security and fighting monsters.~|~translationMissing
Be aware, the deeper into the stronghold you go, the tougher the monster will be. So make sure you bring your best equipment and some food.~|~translationMissing
If you do manage to make it to the end of each floor, you will be able to loot the chest for some loot. But only once per floor.~|~translationMissing
If you decide to kill the monsters, you might find they drop some skull sceptre pieces.~|~translationMissing
Interesting, thanks for the information.~|~translationMissing
Can I have a Security book?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not already have a security book~|~translationMissing
Sure thing, here you go.~|~translationMissing
The Account security tutor hands you a Security book.~|~translationMissing
Use it well.~|~translationMissing
If the player already has a security book~|~translationMissing
You already have one, maybe you should read that one instead.~|~translationMissing
Don't I know you from somewhere?~|~translationMissing
Ah, you're probably talking about my twin brother who works at the Port Sarim prison.~|~translationMissing
He spends all his time giving out security books when he could tell you about security instead.~|~translationMissing
But don't you give out security books too?~|~translationMissing
Well yes, but at least I tell you about account security as well.~|~translationMissing
That's true. Maybe I shouldn't be too quick to judge.~|~translationMissing
No, thank you.~|~translationMissing
Come back any time you need any more information on account security.~|~translationMissing
Greetings. Welcome to the Heroes' Guild.~|~translationMissing
Only the greatest heroes of this land may gain entrance to this guild.~|~translationMissing
I'm a hero, may I apply to join?~|~translationMissing
I'm a hero - may I apply to join?~|~translationMissing
You're a hero? I've never heard of YOU. You are required to possess at least 55 quest points to file an application.~|~translationMissing
Additionally you must have completed the Shield of Arrav, Lost City, Merlin's Crystal and Dragon Slayer I quests.~|~translationMissing
Good for the foremost heroes of the land.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Yes it is.~|~translationMissing
How goes thy quest adventurer?~|~translationMissing
I have all the required items.~|~translationMissing
W-what? What do you mean? There's MORE???~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, I was just having a little fun with you. Just a little Heroes' Guild humour there. What I really meant was~|~translationMissing
Congratulations! You have completed the Heroes' Guild entry requirements! You will find the door now open for you! Enter, Hero! And take this reward!~|~translationMissing

Adventurer (easy)~|~translationMissing
Hello friend. I wish to slay evil and avail them of their loot! Take me to Burgh de Rott!~|~translationMissing
Are you prepared enough to fight the evil down there?~|~translationMissing
I think so? At least my heart knows courage and that should be sufficient for the meantime. I expect that when we get to Burgh de Rott, we'll be able to purchase suitable provisions.~|~translationMissing
But you do realise that the vampyres in Morytania are immune to everything except silver?~|~translationMissing
Er...well, I've not heard mention of that fact, but I have faith that Saradomin will provide the means to furnish me with suitable weapons when I reach Burgh de Rott.~|~translationMissing
And if we happen to run into some vampyres on the journey down there?~|~translationMissing
I trust that you will help us to avoid them. You are a guide after all, aren't you? Anyway, you look like you can handle yourself. I presume you've fought such creatures before and won? How hard can it be?~|~translationMissing
It can be pretty difficult, actually. But you're right, I'll be your guide so I should be able to handle the situation.~|~translationMissing
Why do you want to go to Burgh de Rott?~|~translationMissing
I'm going down there to teach those vampyres a lesson or two. I've heard about the terrible conditions down there and I intend to put a stop to it.~|~translationMissing
Could you defend yourself if we met enemies...?~|~translationMissing
Could you defend yourself if we met enemies on the route to Burgh de Rott?~|~translationMissing
Let's just say that I'm somewhat experienced and I'm happy to take on my fair share of enemies. You don't need to worry about that.~|~translationMissing
I can take you to Burgh de Rott.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a follower~|~translationMissing
Hmmm, it seems that you have a follower. I think it may get lost on this journey if it's left to wander on its own. Let's leave when your follower is safe.~|~translationMissing
Oh really? That would be great! I'll give you a small reward once we reach our destination.~|~translationMissing
Burgh de Rott Ramble begins~|~translationMissing
Ok, which route should we take?~|~translationMissing
(Temple Trekking choose a route interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Ah, so you want to give me some supplies, eh? Let me just open me backpack.~|~translationMissing
(Follower inventory menu interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
This place is a bit grim. How can people live here?~|~translationMissing
Do you visit Burgh de Rott often? You seem to know the route well.~|~translationMissing
When are we going to get to Burgh de Rott?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I hate this trip, but it's better than the opulet life styles forced on us adventurer types. I'd much rather be up to my eyes in mud and having a good fight!~|~translationMissing
Can't you see I'm being attacked...~|~translationMissing
Thanks, I'll get this down my neck.~|~translationMissing
Blimey! Looks like we're going to have to go back to Paterdomus. We can't get over that bridge!~|~translationMissing
Oh, I'm sure we can find a way!~|~translationMissing
Player completes the bridge event~|~translationMissing
Player completes the bog event~|~translationMissing

Player completes the river event~|~translationMissing
Whahay! That was great! But we really should be heading off now.~|~translationMissing

Ahhh, two tentacles!~|~translationMissing
...three tentacles!~|~translationMissing
I think I'm going to faint!~|~translationMissing
Blimey! Look at that beast! You're gonna have to sort that thing out on your own!~|~translationMissing

Adventurer Jon~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name], what can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
What are Adventure Paths?~|~translationMissing
A long time ago, I was a newbie just like you who didn't know what to do and I would be more than happy to pass on my experience.~|~translationMissing
I've created some Adventure Paths which I recommend you to start off with. An Adventure Path is a list of tasks which you can complete in any order.~|~translationMissing
To help you get started on your Adventure Path, I'll also give you a starter kit with some useful items.~|~translationMissing
Once you've completed an Adventure Path task, come back to me and I'll give you a reward.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any Adventure Path starter kits for me?~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't claimed their starter kit yet~|~translationMissing
Adventurer Jon gives you a Combat path starter kit~|~translationMissing
Here are all of the starter kits you have left to claim.~|~translationMissing
If the player has already claimed their starter kit~|~translationMissing
You seem to have already claimed all of your starter kits.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to claim my Adventure Path rewards.~|~translationMissing
If the player hasn't completed a task or has already received their rewards~|~translationMissing
I have no rewards to give you at the moment.~|~translationMissing
If the player only has members rewards left to claim, while on a free-to-play world~|~translationMissing
I have no rewards to give you at the moment. But I do have some members rewards left to give you, visit me on a members world to receive them.~|~translationMissing
If the player can claim rewards, but does not have enough inventory space~|~translationMissing
You should make sure you have space before asking for rewards.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed one or more tasks on a Free-to-play world, with some unclaimed Members rewards~|~translationMissing
The player receives available free-to-play rewards~|~translationMissing
That is the last of the rewards you have currently earned. But I do have some members rewards left to give you, visit me on a members world to receive them.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed one or more tasks and can claim all remaining rewards~|~translationMissing
The player receives available rewards~|~translationMissing
That is the last of your rewards which you have earned.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed one or more tasks, with free inventory slots, but not enough inventory slots to claim all remaining rewards~|~translationMissing
I can't give you any more rewards until you come back with more inventory space.~|~translationMissing
Can you show me some Adventure Paths?~|~translationMissing
Of course, here you go.~|~translationMissing
Disable Adventure Paths.~|~translationMissing
Opting out of Adventure Paths will hide the interface and you will no longer receive task and path notifications. You can talk to Adventurer Jon to opt back into Adventure Paths~|~translationMissing
Opt out of Adventure Paths?~|~translationMissing
You have now opted out of Adventure Paths.~|~translationMissing
You are currently not participating in Adventure Paths. Would you like to join back in?~|~translationMissing

You look new around here, welcome to the world of Gielinor!~|~translationMissing

Well, lucky for you, that is exactly why I am here.~|~translationMissing

to the east, herbs from the garden just outside the castle, and tuna and swordfish fished at the port to the south. Etceteria has also pledged you teak and mahogany logs from their trees to the north, and seeds~|~translationMissing
coffers can store up to 7.5 million gp. Another thing which affects the amounts of resources collected is your approval rating. The more your subjects love you, the more they will be motivated to work hard. King Vargas~|~translationMissing
course, the harder they work at collecting one, the less time they have to spend collecting the others.~|~translationMissing

Oh that sounds interesting.~|~translationMissing
(Aemad's Adventuring Supplies. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
No, I've come to the wrong place.~|~translationMissing
No, sorry, I've come to the wrong place.~|~translationMissing
Hmph. Well, perhaps next time you'll need something from me?~|~translationMissing
Please only talk to the King if it's important. He has a heavy burden to bear with the running of his Kingdom.~|~translationMissing
Apologies! Allow me to introduce myself~|~translationMissing
my name is Aeonisig Raispher, special advisor to King Roald on spiritual matters.~|~translationMissing
Special advisor on spiritual matters? What does that mean?~|~translationMissing
It means that some decisions the King has to make might have unforeseen repercussions on the nation's spiritual sensibilities. My duty is to ensure that Saradominist ideals are not stomped underfoot.~|~translationMissing
My main function is to ensure that King Roald is apprised of all options, especially those that favour the righteous followers of Saradomin.~|~translationMissing
But surely the King should be able to make his own decisions on what's best for Misthalin?~|~translationMissing
What an interesting perspective you have! Totally unworkable of course, but interesting nonetheless.~|~translationMissing
Where did you come from?~|~translationMissing
I took my religious and combat training in several parts of the known world. I've also fought despicable beasts in the wilderness in Saradomin's name. Needless to say I have great experience in the ways of the world and am~|~translationMissing
an invaluable aid to his lordship's decision-making process.~|~translationMissing
How did you come to be an advisor to King Roald?~|~translationMissing
The King of Misthalin, like any great leader, always requires the best advice and the best advisors. He very often summons occasional advisors to help him in certain situations, but it was felt by the Church of Saradomin~|~translationMissing
that a full time advisor on religious matters was needed to ensure fair treatment of Saradomin's followers.~|~translationMissing
How come he doesn't have an advisor for any other religious denominations?~|~translationMissing
Because I simply won't stand for it, that's why! Now, enough of your impertinent questions. I have work to do!~|~translationMissing

The guy at the information kiosk?~|~translationMissing
Yeah! He rocks!~|~translationMissing
Takes all sorts, I guess.~|~translationMissing
Did you know they think this place dates back to the second age?!~|~translationMissing
Yeah. The guy at the information kiosk was telling me.~|~translationMissing
What could you make for me?~|~translationMissing
I mostly just make what I find pretty. I sometimes make dye for the women's clothes to brighten the place up. I can make red, yellow and blue dyes. If you'd like some, just bring me the appropriate ingredients.~|~translationMissing
What do you need to make red dye?~|~translationMissing
3 lots of redberries and 5 coins to you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, make me some red dye please.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have redberries~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough berries to make the red dye.~|~translationMissing
The player receives red dye.~|~translationMissing
I don't think I have all the ingredients yet.~|~translationMissing
You know what you need to get, now come back when you have them. Goodbye for now.~|~translationMissing
I can do without dye at that price.~|~translationMissing
That's your choice, but I would think you have killed for less. I can see it in your eyes.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get redberries?~|~translationMissing
I pick mine from the woods south of Varrock. The food shop in Port Sarim sometimes has some as well.~|~translationMissing
What other colours can you make?~|~translationMissing
Red, yellow and blue. Which one would you like?~|~translationMissing
What do you need to make yellow dye?~|~translationMissing
Yellow is a strange colour to get, comes from onion skins. I need 2 onions and 5 coins to make yellow dye.~|~translationMissing
Okay, make me some yellow dye please.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have enough onions~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough onions to make the yellow dye.~|~translationMissing
The player receives yellow dye.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get onions?~|~translationMissing
There are some onions growing on a farm to the East of here, next to the sheep field.~|~translationMissing
What do you need to make blue dye?~|~translationMissing
2 woad leaves and 5 coins to you.~|~translationMissing
Okay, make me some blue dye please.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have woad leaves~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough woad leaves to make the blue dye.~|~translationMissing
The player receives blue dye.~|~translationMissing
Where do I get woad leaves?~|~translationMissing
Woad leaves are fairly hard to find. My other customers tell me the chief gardener in Falador grows them.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I am happy the colour I am.~|~translationMissing
You are easily pleased with yourself then. When you need dyes, come to me.~|~translationMissing
Cool, do you turn people into frogs?~|~translationMissing
Oh, not for years, but if you meet a talking chicken, you have probably met the professor in the manor north of here. A few years ago it was flying fish. That machine is a menace.~|~translationMissing
You mad old witch, you can't help me.~|~translationMissing
If the player is carrying 21-100 coins~|~translationMissing
Oh, you like to call a witch names do you?~|~translationMissing
Aggie waves her hands about, and you seem to be five coins poorer.~|~translationMissing
That's a fine for insulting a witch. You should learn some respect.~|~translationMissing
If the player is carrying 101 or more coins~|~translationMissing
Aggie waves her hands about, and you seem to be 20 coins poorer.~|~translationMissing
If the player is carrying a pot of flour~|~translationMissing
Aggie waves her hands about, and you seem to have a pot of flour less.~|~translationMissing
Thank you for your kind present of some flour. I am sure you never meant to insult me.~|~translationMissing
You should be careful about insulting a witch. You never know what shape you could wake up in.~|~translationMissing

How do I use the agility course?~|~translationMissing
Agility Boss~|~translationMissing
I'll throw you a stick, which you need to fetch as quickly as possible, from the area beyond the pipes.~|~translationMissing
Be wary of the deathslide - you must hang by your teeth, and if your strength is not up to the job you will fall into a pit of spikes. Also, I would advise not carrying too much extra weight.~|~translationMissing
Bring the stick back to the werewolf waiting at the end of the death slide to get your agility bonus.~|~translationMissing
I will throw your stick as soon as you jump onto the first stone.~|~translationMissing
Grrr - you don't belong in here, human!~|~translationMissing
FETCH!!!!!~|~translationMissing
Why didn't you hand the stick over?!!?~|~translationMissing

Agility Trainer~|~translationMissing
Have you brought the stick yet?~|~translationMissing
What stick?~|~translationMissing
Come on, get round that course - I need something to chew!~|~translationMissing
You need to take your headgear off before you try the Deathslide, otherwise you won't be able to get a good enough grip with your teeth.~|~translationMissing
That headgear won't help you here, human! Take it off!~|~translationMissing
Remember - a slow wolf is a hungry wolf!!~|~translationMissing
Get on with it - you need your whiskers perking!!!!~|~translationMissing
Claws first - think later.~|~translationMissing
Imagine the smell of blood in your nostrils!!!~|~translationMissing
I never really wanted to be an agility trainer...~|~translationMissing
It'll be worth it when you hunt!!~|~translationMissing
Let's see those powerful backlegs at work!!~|~translationMissing
Let the bloodlust take you!!~|~translationMissing
You're the slowest wolf I've ever had the misfortune to witness!!~|~translationMissing
When you're done there's a human with your name on it!!~|~translationMissing
You idiot - you've forgotten the stick!!!!~|~translationMissing
Give my regards to the ground...~|~translationMissing
WAAAAAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!~|~translationMissing
Don't let the spikes or the blood put you off...~|~translationMissing
Now for a true test of teeth...~|~translationMissing
You shouldn't even be here, human!~|~translationMissing
Let's see how strong human teeth are...~|~translationMissing
Remember - no stick, no agility bonus!~|~translationMissing
Bring me the stick when you've finished the course!~|~translationMissing
Don't forget to give me the stick when you're done!~|~translationMissing
Agmundi~|~translationMissing
Oh no, not another human... what do you want then?~|~translationMissing
Oh, do you get humans here often?~|~translationMissing
Not that often, no, but sometimes.~|~translationMissing
Of course, since you people are too big for dwarven clothes, they typically don't stay very long.~|~translationMissing
Why don't you make bigger clothes then?~|~translationMissing
What'd be the point? Besides, I don't make these clothes myself.~|~translationMissing
Who makes these clothes then?~|~translationMissing
Oh, my sister, she lives in Keldagrim-East. Has a little stall on the other side of the Kelda.~|~translationMissing
If she only worked a little harder, like me, she wouldn't have to live in the sewers of the city. Shame really.~|~translationMissing
The sewers? Your sister lives in the sewers?~|~translationMissing
Keldagrim-East, such a ghastly place. Not civil, polite and clean like we are in the West.~|~translationMissing
I still want to buy your clothes.~|~translationMissing
(Agmundi Quality Clothes interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
So do you have any quests for me?~|~translationMissing
Quests? Why would I have any quests?~|~translationMissing
Oh, just anything to do would be fine.~|~translationMissing
No, not right now... maybe I'll have something for you to do later, but nothing at the moment.~|~translationMissing

Before completing Pirate's Treasure~|~translationMissing
I'm looking for Redbeard Frank.~|~translationMissing
Redbeard Frank ye say? He be outside. Says he likes the feel of the wind on his cheeks.~|~translationMissing
Are you going to sit there all day?~|~translationMissing
Aye, I am. I canna walk, ye see.~|~translationMissing
What's stopping you from walking?~|~translationMissing
Arrr, I 'ave only the one leg! I lost its twin when my last ship went down.~|~translationMissing
But I can see both your legs!~|~translationMissing
Nay, young [laddie/lassie], this be a false leg. For years I had me a sturdy wooden peg-leg, but now I wear this dainty little feller.~|~translationMissing
Yon peg-leg kept getting stuck in the floorboards.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps a [bright young laddie/bonnie young lassie] like yerself would like to help me? I be needing another ship to go a-hunting my enemy.~|~translationMissing
If the player owns the ship used during Dragon Slayer~|~translationMissing
Well, I do have a ship that I'm not using. It's the Lady Lumbridge.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! That ship be known to me, and a fine lass she is.~|~translationMissing
I suppose she might be...~|~translationMissing
So would ye be kind enough to let me take her out to sea?~|~translationMissing
I had to pay 2000 gp for that ship. Have you got that much?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not own the ship used during Dragon Slayer~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. And can you afford another ship?~|~translationMissing
Nay, I have nary a penny to my name. All my worldly goods went down with me old ship.~|~translationMissing
So you're actually asking me to give you a free ship.~|~translationMissing
Arrr! Would ye be so kind?~|~translationMissing
No I jolly well wouldn't!~|~translationMissing
Arrr.~|~translationMissing
Do you want to trade?~|~translationMissing
Do you have anything for trade?~|~translationMissing
Nothin' at the moment, but then again the Customs Agents are on the warpath right now.~|~translationMissing
Oi matey, leave my beer alone!~|~translationMissing
Sorry!~|~translationMissing

2.3 If the player has enough money~|~translationMissing
Aisles~|~translationMissing
Hello. Do you wish me to exchange banknotes for you? I charge only 5 coins for each banknote.~|~translationMissing
Hand me the banknotes you wish me to exchange.~|~translationMissing
I am Aisles. I can exchange banknotes for real items. Do you want any banknotes converted?~|~translationMissing
I exchange banknotes for real items. That's not a banknote.~|~translationMissing
I charge 5 coins for exchanging each banknote.~|~translationMissing
Exchange [item name]~|~translationMissing
5 coins~|~translationMissing

Ajjat~|~translationMissing
Greetings, fellow warrior. I am Ajjat, former black knight and now training officer here in the warrior guild.~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me about skillcapes, please?~|~translationMissing
Skillcapes, also known as Capes of Accomplishment, are reserved for the elite of the elite. Only a person who has truly mastered a skill can buy one, and even then a skillcape can only be bought from one who is~|~translationMissing
recognised as the highest skilled in the land at any particular skill.~|~translationMissing
I have the privilege of being the person that controls access to the Skillcape of Attack, which Kamfreena will recognize and allow you to access her Cyclopes without the need for guild tokens.~|~translationMissing
Black Knight? Why are you here?~|~translationMissing
Indeed I was, however their... methods... did not match with my ideals.. so I left. Harrallak, recognising my talent as a warrior, took me in and offered me a job here.~|~translationMissing
Hmm... well if Harrallak trusts you, I guess I can.~|~translationMissing
What's the Dummy Room all about?~|~translationMissing
Ahh yes, the dummies. Another ingenious invention of the noble Dwarf Gamfred. They're mechanical you see and pop up out of the floor. You have to hit them with the correct attack mode before they disappear again.~|~translationMissing
So how do I tell which one is which?~|~translationMissing
There are two different ways. One indication is their colour, the other is the pose and weapons they are holding, for instance, the one holding daggers you will need to hit with a piercing attack.~|~translationMissing
In the room you will find a poster on the wall which can help you recognise each different dummy.~|~translationMissing
That sounds ingenious!~|~translationMissing
Indeed, you may find that you need several weapons to be successful 100% of the time, but keep trying. The weapons shop upstairs may help you there.~|~translationMissing
May I claim my tokens please?~|~translationMissing
If the player has tokens to claim~|~translationMissing
Of course! Here you go, you've earned [amount] tokens!~|~translationMissing
Player receives [amount] Warrior guild tokens.~|~translationMissing
If the player has no tokens to claim~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid you have not earned any tokens yet. Try some of the activities around the guild to earn some.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I'll go see what I can find.~|~translationMissing
Farewell warrior. Stay away from the dark side.~|~translationMissing
Ah, but I can see you are already a master in the fine art of attacking, perhaps you have come to me to purchase a Cape of Attack, and thus join the elite few who have mastered this exacting skill?~|~translationMissing
When wearing this cape, Kamfreena will recognize your ability and allow you to access her Cyclopes without the need for guild tokens.~|~translationMissing
May I buy a Skillcape of Attack, please?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a Skillcape of Attack~|~translationMissing
99000 gold! Are you mad?~|~translationMissing
99000! Are you mad?~|~translationMissing
I would gladly pay such a paltry sum for a splendid cape.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have at least 99,000 coins in their inventory~|~translationMissing
But, unfortunately, I don't have enough money with me.~|~translationMissing
Well come back and see me when you do.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 99,000 coins but not enough inventory space~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 99,000 coins and enough inventory space~|~translationMissing
Excellent! Wear that cape with pride my friend.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives an Attack cape and hood and pays 99,000 coins.)~|~translationMissing
If the player has a Skillcape of Attack~|~translationMissing
Skillcape~|~translationMissing
Hood~|~translationMissing
May I have another hood for my cape, please?~|~translationMissing
Most certainly, and free of charge!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives an Attack hood.)~|~translationMissing
Ajjat hands you another hood for your skillcape.~|~translationMissing

Hi there!~|~translationMissing
Al Kharid Camel~|~translationMissing
Why, helloooo!~|~translationMissing
A camel?~|~translationMissing
Well this is grand darling. How nice it is to make your acquaintance!~|~translationMissing
Thank you. Nice to meet you too.~|~translationMissing
Wait a minute. How am I talking to you without a Camulet?~|~translationMissing
My dear, I'm a camel, how should I know?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm. I suppose this spell must tap directly into your mind. So, there's no need for language to get in the way.~|~translationMissing
I think I am somewhat confused.~|~translationMissing
May one ask how you contacted me?~|~translationMissing
I'm just using one of the Lunar spells.~|~translationMissing
Oh my, oh my. These youngsters today and their new-fangled gadgets!~|~translationMissing
I am Al Shabim Effendi! I am the leader of the Bedabin peoples!~|~translationMissing
Okay thanks!~|~translationMissing
Okay Thanks!~|~translationMissing
Good day Effendi!~|~translationMissing
What is there to do around here?~|~translationMissing
Well, we are all very busy most of the time, tending to the pineapples. They are grown in a secret location, to stop thieves from raiding our most precious prize.~|~translationMissing
This is the home of the Bedabin. We're a peaceful tribe of desert dwellers. Some idiots call us 'Tenti's', a childish name borne of ignorance.~|~translationMissing
We're renowned for surviving in the harshest desert climate. We also grow the 'Bedabin ambrosia.'... A pineapple of such delicious sumptiousness that it defies description.~|~translationMissing
Take a look around our camp if you like!~|~translationMissing

2 Dialogue whilst wearing a camulet~|~translationMissing
2.1 First time speaking to Al~|~translationMissing
2.2 Subsequent conversations with Al~|~translationMissing
Ask the camel about its dung.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry to bother you, but could you spare me a little dung?~|~translationMissing
The camel didn't seem to appreciate that question.~|~translationMissing
Say something unpleasant.~|~translationMissing
If I go near that camel, it'll probably bite my hand off.~|~translationMissing
Mmm... looks like that camel would make a nice kebab.~|~translationMissing
I wonder if that camel has fleas...~|~translationMissing
Neither - I'm a polite person.~|~translationMissing
Al the Camel~|~translationMissing
Oh yes. If you'd be so kind...~|~translationMissing
Well, just you close your eyes first. I'm not doing it while you're watching me!~|~translationMissing
I hope that's what you wanted!~|~translationMissing
Ohhh yes. Lovely.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, were you saying something to me?~|~translationMissing
No, er, nothing important.~|~translationMissing
Never mind, it is unimportant when I have such important matters weighing on my soul.~|~translationMissing
How important can a camel's problems be?~|~translationMissing
Well, you see, there is a camel called Elly. A beautiful, wondrous camel, with hide like spun gold and teeth that shine like an oasis.~|~translationMissing
...I see.~|~translationMissing
I've written many poems describing her beauty. Would you like to hear one?~|~translationMissing
It's all right, I'm...~|~translationMissing
Shall I compare thee to a desert's day? Thou art drier and more rough-skinned.~|~translationMissing
Rough sandstorms shake the cactuses away And summer's heat defers to autumn wind.~|~translationMissing
Look, I don't really have the time to...~|~translationMissing
And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or desert's changing course untrimmed...~|~translationMissing
Please, stop.~|~translationMissing
But I've only got six lines left!~|~translationMissing
That's six too many. If I really want to hear your poetry, I'll tell you, okay?~|~translationMissing
Very well. Come back and talk to me if you want to hear more.~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's you again. Have you come back to listen to my poems?~|~translationMissing
That's so kind of you. Which one would you like to hear?~|~translationMissing
'Shall I compare thee to a desert's day' is my finest yet, but I've also composed others.~|~translationMissing
Listen to 'Shall I compare thee to a desert's day'.~|~translationMissing
That's my favourite poem. Ahem...~|~translationMissing
Nor Zamorak brag thou art in his shades, When in eternal lines to sand thou growest,~|~translationMissing
So long as camels breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.~|~translationMissing
Ah, Elly, how beautiful you are.~|~translationMissing
If this is the first time speaking to Al again~|~translationMissing
What does Elly think of your poems?~|~translationMissing
She's never heard them.~|~translationMissing
I suspect she loves another - Ollie, another camel who roams with her to the north.~|~translationMissing
So I shall stay here and compose poems for her.~|~translationMissing
Why not tell her how you feel?~|~translationMissing
She seems happy enough as she is, and I have my poems to comfort me.~|~translationMissing
Well, best of luck with that.~|~translationMissing
If you want to hear my poems once more, please come back again.~|~translationMissing
On subsequent visits~|~translationMissing
Listen to 'This Is Just To Say'.~|~translationMissing
I wrote this poem when I went to the oasis to nibble at a tree, then discovered I'd left nothing for Elly to nibble. I was distraught.~|~translationMissing
This Is Just To Say~|~translationMissing
I have nibbled the cacti that were by the oasis,~|~translationMissing
and which you were probably saving for lunch.~|~translationMissing
Forgive me, they were delicious, so crunchy and so cold.~|~translationMissing
I wonder if she's forgiven me for eating her snack.~|~translationMissing
Ah, well. I shall return to writing poems to Elly's beauty.~|~translationMissing

Alchemy Guardian~|~translationMissing
Greetings young one. What wisdom do you seek?~|~translationMissing
What do I have to do in this room?~|~translationMissing
In this room you will see various cupboards. It is your task to search the cupboards to find items to turn into gold using your low or high alchemy spells. You can deposit the money in the receptacle at the end of the~|~translationMissing
hall in order to receive your Alchemist Pizazz Points. This money is used for the upkeep of the training arena as well as magic shops all around Gielinor. Keep an eye on the costs of each item as these will change~|~translationMissing
from time-to-time, as will the location of the items. Occasionally one of the items will be indicated as costing no runestones to convert to money.~|~translationMissing
How will I be rewarded?~|~translationMissing
You will get magic experience from casting the alchemist spells, as well as 1 Alchemist Pizazz Point for every 100 coins you deposit, and 10% of the coins you deposit will be given to you as you leave. Keep in mind that you~|~translationMissing
will not be able to take more than 1000 coins back out with you.~|~translationMissing
Got any tips that may help me?~|~translationMissing
You must remember to keep an eye on the various costs of the items. If you watch the movements of the other players, you might be able to guess which are the best places to visit. You will get 1 Pizazz Point for~|~translationMissing
every 100 coins, so if you have 190 coins, why not get an extra 10?~|~translationMissing
Oh, and a word of warning~|~translationMissing
should you decide to leave this room by a method other than the exit portals, you will be teleported to the entrance and have any items that you picked up in the room removed, but the gold~|~translationMissing
coins and Pizazz points you earned will be granted.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, bye!~|~translationMissing
Telekinetic Guardian~|~translationMissing
Use what you've learned, young one.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Guild.~|~translationMissing
The Myths' Guild is home to those who wish to uncover the lost secrets of this world. We investigate the myths of this land to see if any facts may be hidden within them.~|~translationMissing
We discover things here that others only dream of. The cost of entry is not insignificant though, only the most worthy may share in our secrets.~|~translationMissing
Here you will discover things that others only dream of. The cost of entry is not insignificant though, only the most worthy may share in our secrets.~|~translationMissing
Am I worthy?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the requirements for Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
Not yet. However, that could well change. Go out and hone your skills then return to us.~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Unknown condition edit)~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. Perhaps that will change one day.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the requirements but has not started Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
Not yet. However, that could well change.~|~translationMissing
For as long as history remembers, dragons have roamed these lands. But despite how long they've been here, much of their history remains hidden.~|~translationMissing
There are tales of course but tales are not enough for us. We want you to discover the truth. Where did the dragons come from? Why are they here? Who do they serve?~|~translationMissing
Answer these questions for us. Help us fill our Library of Knowledge. In return, we will grant you access to the Guild and you will reap the rewards within.~|~translationMissing
So do you feel up for the challenge?~|~translationMissing
Start the Dragon Slayer II quest?~|~translationMissing
Head to Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers at Musa Point. There you'll find Dallas Jones. We've heard that he is investigating the destruction of Crandor. This seems like a good place to begin.~|~translationMissing
If the player has started Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
Not yet. However, you are on the right path. Complete the task we've assigned you and we will allow you entry into the Guild.~|~translationMissing
Prior to the release of Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid the Guild is not currently accepting new members. However, we will soon be opening our doors again.~|~translationMissing
When we do, you should return here. We may well have a place for you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
Absolutely. You've proven your worth to the guild and may enter whenever you please.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not started Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
) How can I gain access to the Guild?~|~translationMissing
Only the most worthy may access our Guild and I'm afraid you are not quite there yet. Go out and hone your skills then return to us.~|~translationMissing
You do not meet all the requirements to start the Dragon Slayer II quest.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the requirements for Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
Only the most worthy are allowed access into the Myths' Guild. If you want entry, you'll need to prove yourself.~|~translationMissing
Continues above from "For as long as history remembers"~|~translationMissing
(If the player has partially completed Dragon Slayer II~|~translationMissing
) Let's talk about my quest.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet discovered anything~|~translationMissing
Well return to us once you do. If you help us fill our Library of Knowledge, we shall grant you access to the Guild.~|~translationMissing
If the player has been to Lithkren but not opened the doors~|~translationMissing
I'm investigating the origin of Elvarg. I've found some old doors on a ruined island but they're locked. I'm trying to find the key.~|~translationMissing
Well keep at it. If you help us fill our Library of Knowledge, we shall grant you access to the Guild.~|~translationMissing
If the player has opened the grandiose doors on Lithkren but not entered them~|~translationMissing
I'm investigating the origin of Elvarg. I've found some old doors on a ruined island but they're locked. I think something important lies behind them.~|~translationMissing
If the player has released Galvek~|~translationMissing
I was investigating the origin of Elvarg but I accidently released a dragonkin.~|~translationMissing
Farewell adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Aleck~|~translationMissing
Hello, hello, and a most warm welcome to my Hunter Emporium. We have everything the discerning Hunter could need.~|~translationMissing
Would you like me to show you our range of equipment? Or was there something specific you were after?~|~translationMissing
Ok, let's see what you've got!~|~translationMissing
(Aleck's Hunter Emporium. interface opens)~|~translationMissing
I'm not interested, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Well, if you do ever find yourself in need of the finest Hunter equipment available, then you know where to come.~|~translationMissing
Who's that guy over there?~|~translationMissing
Him? I think he might be crazy. Either that or he's seeking attention.~|~translationMissing
He keeps trying to sell me these barmy looking weapons he's invented. I can't see them working, personally.~|~translationMissing

Good day to you, my friend.~|~translationMissing
Fancy going up to the castle for a bit of a snack?~|~translationMissing
Give me a moment, I have a bit of someone stuck in my teeth...~|~translationMissing
Alfonse the waiter~|~translationMissing
Welcome to the Shrimp and Parrot. Would you like to order, madam?~|~translationMissing
(The Shrimp and Parrot interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Where do you get your Karambwan from?~|~translationMissing
We buy directly off Lubufu, a local fisherman. He seems to have a monopoly over Karambwan sale.~|~translationMissing
Where can I find Lubufu?~|~translationMissing
He is usually working just to the south of the town.~|~translationMissing
How does he manage a monopoly?~|~translationMissing
Simple - nobody else knows how to catch Karambwan. It is a closely guarded secret.~|~translationMissing

1.2 After completion of the Rogue Trader miniquest~|~translationMissing
Hello [player name]. How's the adventuring going?~|~translationMissing
Hi Ali. Not bad. How are you?~|~translationMissing
Still selling.~|~translationMissing
I would like to have a look at your selection of blackjacks.~|~translationMissing
Hang on a second while I get my stock of blackjacks out.~|~translationMissing
(Ali's Discount Wares. (Blackjacks) interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
I would like to have a look at your selection of clothes.~|~translationMissing
Hang on a second while I get the garments.~|~translationMissing
(Ali's Discount Wares. (Clothing) interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
I would like to have a look at your selection of runes.~|~translationMissing
Hang on a second.~|~translationMissing
Well at the moment I don't exactly have a selection of runes.~|~translationMissing
You don't?~|~translationMissing
Those boxes from your friend Aubury have a very odd locking mechanism.~|~translationMissing
You have managed to get them off?~|~translationMissing
Not exactly.~|~translationMissing
What do you mean by 'not exactly'?~|~translationMissing
What I mean by 'not exactly' is 'no, I haven't managed to get the lock off'.~|~translationMissing
I was kind of hoping that you would have a look at them. There are two distinctive types of caskets one with a simple locking mechanism and another, which ummm... looks a little tricky to say the least.~|~translationMissing
Try opening a small casket of runes~|~translationMissing
I think I'll have a go at opening a small casket of runes.~|~translationMissing
Force box.~|~translationMissing
If the player fails at forcing open the box~|~translationMissing
Your arms tire from the exertions of trying to open the casket...~|~translationMissing
You fail to open the chest.~|~translationMissing
If the player successfully forces the box to open~|~translationMissing
Buy all the runes for [amount].~|~translationMissing
Player pays [amount] and receives a random selection of runes.~|~translationMissing
Find out what the runes are.~|~translationMissing
(Ali Morrisane's discount rune store. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Pick lock.~|~translationMissing
If the player fails to pick the lock~|~translationMissing
You fail to pick the lock - your fingers get numb from fumbling with the lock.~|~translationMissing
If the player successfully picks the lock~|~translationMissing
Examine lock.~|~translationMissing
(Rogue Trader sudoku interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Try opening a large casket of runes~|~translationMissing
I'm feeling lucky, let's have a look at opening one of those large caskets.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... This lock looks like it may be impossible to prise open.~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... This lock looks like it may be impossible to pick open.~|~translationMissing
On second thoughts I don't really need any runes.~|~translationMissing
I would like to have a look at your general stock.~|~translationMissing
Hi! I have this money off voucher!~|~translationMissing
Oh! Unfortunately it seems to have expired yesterday!~|~translationMissing
But I only just got it from Ali the Leaflet dropper!~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.~|~translationMissing
But you're the one that had them printed!~|~translationMissing
Look, I had those printed to win over the local traders. They weren't too pleased with the money off voucher, but I promised them I would repay their losses.~|~translationMissing
So that would be why they're all out of date then?~|~translationMissing
Anyway, it would be a shame for you to leave without looking at my wares.~|~translationMissing
Anything interesting?~|~translationMissing
For you, always. As a matter of fact I have just acquired a fleet of magic carpets, which operate throughout the Kharidian desert.~|~translationMissing
Wow that sounds great, how about your stall?~|~translationMissing
Trade is good, but I would like to expand and diversify, but it's proving a little more difficult than I initially thought.~|~translationMissing
I think the other merchants are conspiring against me.~|~translationMissing
Oh come on! You're just being paranoid now.~|~translationMissing
Well maybe I can't get any new suppliers then because I'm Pollnivnian.~|~translationMissing
You're what?~|~translationMissing
From Pollnivneach.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I could help you then?~|~translationMissing
Perhaps you could.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed Icthlarin's Little Helper~|~translationMissing
My friend in Sophanem... Ahh never mind him, maybe we might have a look at him another time.~|~translationMissing
Is there anyone else you want me to talk to on your behalf?~|~translationMissing
There's a blackjack seller in Pollnivneach, a cautious type of guy, not the usual entrepreneurial sort that I would normally deal with, but...~|~translationMissing
I think that he has a product with real potential...~|~translationMissing
What? .... Blackjacks?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but at the moment the product isn't polished enough, if you could convince him to create a larger variety of weapon I would gladly stock his products.~|~translationMissing
So what's in this for me?~|~translationMissing
What's in this for me?~|~translationMissing
I thought you wanted to help.~|~translationMissing
Of course, but everyone seems to be benefiting here but me.~|~translationMissing
Well the trader gets their product sold, you get your cut, but what do I get?~|~translationMissing
You get access to more products. Is that not reward enough?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... Perhaps not.~|~translationMissing
Didn't we also agree that you would get discounted travel on my magic carpet network?~|~translationMissing
Oh ya, I forgot.~|~translationMissing
So what's your problem then?~|~translationMissing
I don't have one I guess.~|~translationMissing
Good, that's what I like to hear. Now where were we?~|~translationMissing
Ok I'll get on to it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed Icthlarin's Little Helper~|~translationMissing
I have an old friend - a cloth merchant Siamun, who lives in Sophanem - Do you know the place?~|~translationMissing
Umm..... Images of cats and priests come to mind. Ah yes! There we go, it's the city of the dead South of Pollnivneach isn't it?~|~translationMissing
That's the one, well if you could convince him to supply me with some of his merchandise, I would be more than willing to sell them to the masses ...... for a small percentage of course.~|~translationMissing
Siamun's clothes seem to have really struck a chord with the locals in Al Kharid. Menaphite culture seems to be taking off here, rumour has it that one of Prince Ali's servants bought him one of Siamun's robes.~|~translationMissing
Wow, that sounds positive.~|~translationMissing
Quite, if I don't say so myself. But in order to keep things fresh, the next time you're in Sophanem, could you ask that cranky old so-and-so Siamun to produce a new line of clothing?~|~translationMissing
Sure, why not. The Sultan himself might even buy some of the new range.~|~translationMissing
That would be the day.~|~translationMissing
Who did you want me to talk to again?~|~translationMissing
Could you talk to your friend Aubury in Varrock about supplying me with runes?~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that could work out quite well. Varrock is always quite busy, so I might try to get a couple of other things done while I'm there.~|~translationMissing
Don't tarry there too long, I'm quite anxious to get a rune store open before anyone else in this area.~|~translationMissing
I'll tell you what then, how about I let you have discounted flights on my magic carpet rides?~|~translationMissing
Wow that would be great.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, so we have a win, win, win situation on our hands then.~|~translationMissing
I think I need just one more product type, something, magical ... now what could I stock that's magical, has large demand and a pretty good profit margin...~|~translationMissing
How about runes?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that would be perfect, but who could I get that would supply? There really seems to be a gap in the market in the desert but I don't know anyone in that line of business.~|~translationMissing
Hang on, I know somebody called Aubury, decent fella. I helped him out a while back. Perhaps I could approach him about the idea.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, the rune seller from Varrock. That would be perfect. He's far enough away that he wouldn't end up competing with himself.~|~translationMissing
Well the rune market is a limited one, if I were to sell his runes from a location nearby his shop, then I would take part of his market share so he would in fact not benefit from me selling runes.~|~translationMissing
Ah ha, I think I know where this is going. So because you're located far enough away from him you will take up someone else's share in the market and Aubury will make more money as a result.~|~translationMissing
Very well anticipated.~|~translationMissing
Well you had better get going, you've a fair bit of travelling ahead of you. Unless you want to make a small purchase from me first?~|~translationMissing
No I'm really too busy.~|~translationMissing
Ok~|~translationMissing
Good job on getting the rune stone shipments sorted. I'm just receiving the first of them. Though there seems to be a funny sort of locking mechanism on them, which I haven't completely figured out.~|~translationMissing
No problem. I might have a look at it later.~|~translationMissing
[player name], I would like to commend you on all the selfless help you have given me.~|~translationMissing
It was nothing, really.~|~translationMissing
I think you underestimate your efforts. Anyway, as a token of my gratitude I have told all my magic carpet attendants to allow you to travel on the carpets at a discounted rate.~|~translationMissing
Really, Ali, there is no need.~|~translationMissing
I insist.~|~translationMissing
I hear you're planning to expand your business here...~|~translationMissing
Of course, my friend. Any good salesman ought to take the opportunities that present themselves.~|~translationMissing
But your men are threatening the other shopkeepers!~|~translationMissing
That is regrettable, I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
And the gnomes don't sound very happy about your magic carpet business.~|~translationMissing
A good businessman looks for all the opportunities he can.~|~translationMissing
Aren't you going to do anything about your men?~|~translationMissing
Well, these associates of my nephew can be somewhat... overenthusiastic.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure they'll settle down soon.~|~translationMissing
But they're threatening to hurt the shopkeepers if they don't cooperate!~|~translationMissing
Well, there's a simple solution there, don't you agree?~|~translationMissing
Are you planning to take over all of Al Kharid's shops?~|~translationMissing
It's a step in the right direction.~|~translationMissing
Now, would you like to have a look at my wares?~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a random item from Ali's Discount Wares.)~|~translationMissing
Well, good luck with your business.~|~translationMissing
What will you do about the gnomes?~|~translationMissing
They can continue running their gliders into trees, and I'll keep my business going. Sooner or later it'll all work out in my favour.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, before you go, take a look at my wares.~|~translationMissing
Before you go, have a look at my wares.~|~translationMissing

No thanks I'm ok. Thanks for your time.~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm called Ali and from here. Do you want me?~|~translationMissing
Actually all my uncles are called Ali!~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, well do any of them have a stall in the Bazaar in Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
That's a difficult question to answer. Everyone in the town have uncles called Ali.~|~translationMissing

That beast would probably bite my fingers off if I tried to pet it.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Camel~|~translationMissing
If you want me to bite your fingers off, you're going the right way about it!~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to pet that! It will probably bite my hand off, that filthy beast.~|~translationMissing
Watch who you're calling a filthy beast, human.~|~translationMissing
Mmmm... you'd make a tasty kebab.~|~translationMissing
And you'd make an excellent spit bucket! Pchoo!~|~translationMissing
I'm not going to pet that nasty creature! I might get fleas... or worse!~|~translationMissing
You're fairly nasty yourself, human. When was the last time you took a shower?~|~translationMissing

1.3 After The Feud~|~translationMissing
Well yes actually I'd like to ask about something else.~|~translationMissing
No but thanks for your time.~|~translationMissing
Indeed I should know, and indeed I do! I was just testing you!~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) A discount camel store?~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Tell me about this town.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) Lovely day isn't it?~|~translationMissing
But you are in luck - I have another two beautiful camels arriving in soon from the best stable in all of Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
Camels, beautiful? I worry about you.~|~translationMissing
Well Sandy, the female camel is a placid beast, and is 20 years of age and comes from a prestigious family whose mother was the part of the Sultan's baggage train.~|~translationMissing
Lumps, on the other hand is a 15 year old male, a bit surly and prone to bouts of stubbornness. However he more than makes up for this failing with his immense strength and stamina.~|~translationMissing
Both of them are of the 'Camelus Horribleus' family, a breed peculiar only to this area of Gielinor. It is....~|~translationMissing
Ok, ok, that's enough! So they're camels then!~|~translationMissing
One cannot put a price on life, they are precious beyond the worth of the crass value of gold coins!~|~translationMissing
Pah! That might buy you a mangy flea infested sheep if you're lucky. Don't insult me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than 500 coins~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough free inventory space~|~translationMissing
I would consider giving them to you if you were able to look after them. But it is abundantly clear that you've got your hands full at the moment.~|~translationMissing
If the player has sufficient space and coins~|~translationMissing
(Player receives two camel receipts.)~|~translationMissing
Here are the receipts for the camels so that you can pick them up as soon as I get them in.~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than 1,000 coins~|~translationMissing
You are too generous, I would have sold for half of that!~|~translationMissing
(If the player no longer has the receipts~|~translationMissing
) About those camels, I've lost the receipt. Can I have another?~|~translationMissing
About those camels, I've lost the receipt can I have another?~|~translationMissing
If the player handed over the receipts to the gang leaders~|~translationMissing
If the player dropped their receipts~|~translationMissing
(Player receives [one or two] camel receipts.)~|~translationMissing
(Transcript missing?- Unkown what the chatbox displays at this point edit)~|~translationMissing
No, they didn't so I sold them as Kebab meat!~|~translationMissing
Not Sandy and Lumps! You beast! Get out of my shop now!~|~translationMissing
I'm not really a camel person so I gave them to a better owner.~|~translationMissing
Didn't I warn you that a camel is not like a puppy or a kitten, fun for a few days and then a tasty snack? They're more than that, they're for life!~|~translationMissing
I decided to try use them to end the hostilities between the two gangs.~|~translationMissing
Good luck with that.~|~translationMissing
(Non-quest dialogue) I'm looking for Ali from Pollnivneach.~|~translationMissing
Not much really, I just want to thank you for what you have done for this village, I can now get on with business.~|~translationMissing
Well I've been debating whether I should diversify. I might move into camel rental although I do have all these cages lying around which I could put to some use.~|~translationMissing
Well good luck to you in whatever venture you do decide to go ahead with.~|~translationMissing
This page was last modified on 10 November 2022, at 02~|~translationMissing
25.~|~translationMissing
You look glum.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Carter~|~translationMissing
Business here really seems to have dried up. I had a good thing going here and you spoiled it.~|~translationMissing
Well it serves you right really. Taking advantage of people like that.~|~translationMissing
So want to buy some water?~|~translationMissing
To you 1000 coins for a waterskin!~|~translationMissing
Ok, I feel sorry for you.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 1000 coins~|~translationMissing
You don't have 1000 coins to buy the water with.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 1000 coins~|~translationMissing
You buy a full waterskin for 1000 coins!~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Waterskin(4).)~|~translationMissing
I think I'll give it a miss.~|~translationMissing
Wow! look at this place, it's so colourful.~|~translationMissing
Ali the dyer~|~translationMissing
Why thank you. Can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
I take it by the clothes you are wearing and this room that you are in the dye trade?~|~translationMissing
How observant of you.~|~translationMissing
Could you make some dye for me please?~|~translationMissing
What colour dye do you want? I can make you blue, red or yellow dyes for you. If you bring me the correct raw materials.~|~translationMissing
Hmm.... 3 lots of redberries should do the trick and 25 coins should cover any other costs.~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than three redberries~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than 25 coins~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough coins to pay for the dye.~|~translationMissing
If the player has sufficient gold and berries~|~translationMissing
Ok make me some red dye please.~|~translationMissing
You hand the redberries and some coins to Rana, who then rummages around some shelves, eventually finding a red bottle, which she then hands to you.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives some red dye.)~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, I still think that the price is fairly reasonable considering that I'm the only source of dye this side of the Shantay pass.~|~translationMissing
Where would I find a redberry bush?~|~translationMissing
Well you could try growing them. They shouldn't be too hard to grow.~|~translationMissing
If I didn't care to grow my own, where else could I get some?~|~translationMissing
Well I know for sure that the desert climate wouldn't suit them. I have mine picked for me in the woods south of Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Yellow is an awkward colour to recreate, I guess if you got me 2 onions I could use their skins to make a warm yellow dye for you. Oh yes and lest I forget I'll need 25 coins to cover the cost of the glass ware and~|~translationMissing
my wages.~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than two onions~|~translationMissing
If the player has sufficient gold and onions~|~translationMissing
Ok make me some yellow dye please.~|~translationMissing
You hand two onions to Rana, who then rummages around some shelves, eventually finding a yellow bottle, which she then hands to you.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives some yellow dye.)~|~translationMissing
Where could I find some onions?~|~translationMissing
Generally you would find onions in vegetable gardens, silly.~|~translationMissing
Ok you have me there but is there anywhere around here where I could get my hands on some onions?~|~translationMissing
I really don't know. A friend of mine grows hers on a farms near Draynor village. But that's a little far from here to be useful.~|~translationMissing
To make a bottle of blue dye I'll need 2 woad leaves and 25 coins from you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has less than two woad leaves~|~translationMissing
If the player has sufficient gold and woad leaves~|~translationMissing
Ok make me some blue dye please.~|~translationMissing
You hand the woad leaves and some coins to Rana, who then rummages around some shelves, eventually finding a blue bottle, which she then hands to you.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives some blue dye.)~|~translationMissing
Where can I get some woad leaves?~|~translationMissing
Woad leaves are fairly rare. My other customers tell me there's a gardener in Falador who grows them.~|~translationMissing
On second thoughts I don't really need any dye.~|~translationMissing
On second thoughts, I don't think that I need some dye right now.~|~translationMissing
How did you get into the colour business?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's quite simple really my mother was a drysalter and I learnt the trade from her.~|~translationMissing
Umm, what's a drysalter, it isn't a medical condition is it?~|~translationMissing
No silly, it's someone who deals with preservatives and dyes. I didn't really enjoy the preservative side of things so I've chosen to deal solely in dyeing.~|~translationMissing
So how's business then?~|~translationMissing
It's a dyeing trade! Oh gosh, I'm sorry, that was a truly dreadful joke.~|~translationMissing
Hmm yes, about the worst I've heard today at least.~|~translationMissing
Thanks. But really, it's not the best around here, nearly everyone in this town wears only white, which means I don't exactly do a roaring trade. Now is there anything I can get you?~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'm just having a look around.~|~translationMissing

Ali the Farmer~|~translationMissing
Oh, er, hello. What do you want?~|~translationMissing
What can you tell me about Al Kharid?~|~translationMissing
There's not much farming land around here. Only that little patch outside.~|~translationMissing
Can you give me any advice on farming here in the desert?~|~translationMissing
Like I said, I only know about cactuses...~|~translationMissing
Just tell me about cactuses, then.~|~translationMissing
First you have to weed the patch using a rake.~|~translationMissing
Can you give me any other advice?~|~translationMissing
Not really. I've not done much farming recently.~|~translationMissing
Well, can you at least sell me any gardening tools or seeds?~|~translationMissing
Sorry. They haven't been delivered yet.~|~translationMissing
So, what do you do here?~|~translationMissing
I'm going to set up a shop selling farming implements. That patch out there may be small, but it's all we've got.~|~translationMissing
I hear you work for Ali Morrisane...~|~translationMissing
Yes, he bought these tents and had them put up for us. He says he'll also get our goods in so we can start selling them soon.~|~translationMissing
I only know how to farm cactuses, so this spot is perfect.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I should talk to him...~|~translationMissing
Of course. He's always happy to talk to possible business partners.~|~translationMissing
I hear you've been threatening the other shopkeepers.~|~translationMissing
Now why would you think that?~|~translationMissing
One of the shopkeepers told they were threatened by a man with a rake...~|~translationMissing
Those people just don't want us to succeed. Don't listen to them!~|~translationMissing
This page was last modified on 26 May 2022, at 06~|~translationMissing
Ali the Guard~|~translationMissing
I'm working. What do you have to say that's so urgent?~|~translationMissing
There's a lot of space here. More open space than back home.~|~translationMissing
So where is back home?~|~translationMissing
Pollnivneach. It's a town to the south of the Shantay Pass.~|~translationMissing
I'm on guard duty. Making sure nobody tries to steal anything from the house and tents in the middle of town.~|~translationMissing
Why are you only guarding those buildings?~|~translationMissing
That's all I've been hired to guard.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, he hired me. He owns this house and these two tents, too.~|~translationMissing
Is the work good?~|~translationMissing
It pays better than back home.~|~translationMissing
Why, what did you do back home?~|~translationMissing
Never you mind.~|~translationMissing
But Ali Morrisane pays us well, at least.~|~translationMissing
Why not? He always likes to meet potential business partners.~|~translationMissing
So? They talk too much.~|~translationMissing
You're not going to deny it?~|~translationMissing
Why bother? None of them can fight back, after all.~|~translationMissing
Good day old hag.~|~translationMissing
Old hag indeed! I have a name you know!~|~translationMissing
Does it happen to be... Ali?~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's actually Alisha, but they let me move in anyway. Not many hags about these days, and beggars can't be choosers!~|~translationMissing
So can I call you Al?~|~translationMissing
Only if I can call you Betty!~|~translationMissing
Now what do you want from the old hag of Pollnivneach? Hexes? Curses? Eternal youth? Poisons? You name it, I can brew it.~|~translationMissing
Actually I don't want any of that stuff, I'm new in town and I wanted to get to know the locals.~|~translationMissing
I'm busy brewing potions, so if you disturb me again without reason, I will turn you into a frog!~|~translationMissing
Sorry! I won't let it happen again.~|~translationMissing
Alisha the Hag~|~translationMissing

2 Treasure Trails~|~translationMissing
2.1 Medium~|~translationMissing
2.1.1 Answering the clue~|~translationMissing
Ali the Kebab seller~|~translationMissing
Hello. What can I do for you?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, what can you do for me?~|~translationMissing
Well, that depends.~|~translationMissing
Depends on what?~|~translationMissing
It depends on whether you like kebabs or not.~|~translationMissing
Seeing as I'm in the kebab construction industry, I mainly help people in need of a kebab.~|~translationMissing
Well then, what kind of kebabs do you, er, construct?~|~translationMissing
I offer two different types of kebabs~|~translationMissing
the standard run- of-the-mill kebab seen throughout Gielinor and enjoyed by many an intoxicated dwarf, and my speciality, the extra-hot kebab. So which shall it be?~|~translationMissing
I want a standard kebab, please.~|~translationMissing
That will be three gold coins.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 3 coins~|~translationMissing
Yes, actually.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'm good.~|~translationMissing
Come back soon, I could do with a few more customers.~|~translationMissing
I seem to be short on coins. Sorry.~|~translationMissing
Could I have an extra-hot kebab please?~|~translationMissing
Could I have one of those crazy hot kebabs of yours?~|~translationMissing
One super kebab coming up! Be careful, they really are as hot as they're made out to be.~|~translationMissing
Sure, sure.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 5 coins~|~translationMissing
Would you sell me that bottle of special kebab sauce?~|~translationMissing
Well, that depends. What do you intend to do with it?~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, I've no intention of setting up a rival kebab shop.~|~translationMissing
But then what do you want it for?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, but I think I could have a little bit of fun with it.~|~translationMissing
You're not going to put it in Drunken Ali's drink, are you? That's what happened the last time I gave someone the sauce.~|~translationMissing
No, that would be a bit clich?. I think I'll come up with something more original.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I might get back to you on the sauce. I'm a bit overburdened as it is.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Kebab seller gives you the red hot sauce.~|~translationMissing
Just be careful with it, it's potent enough to give a camel the runs.~|~translationMissing
What is the difference between the standard and the extra-hot kebab?~|~translationMissing
If I told you that I would have to kill you. Kebab construction is a cut-throat industry. The extra-hot kebab gives me my competitive edge and if I were to divulge my secrets to every passing adventurer, I'd~|~translationMissing
soon be out of business.~|~translationMissing
So there's no difference except the sauce you use?~|~translationMissing
Shh! Keep your voice down. You should have told me you were from the union.~|~translationMissing
I want a kebab, please.~|~translationMissing
Listen I've got to run. I'll catch you later.~|~translationMissing
Listen, I've got to run. I'll catch you later.~|~translationMissing
I need some information.~|~translationMissing
If information is what you need, there are many better people to ask than myself who could help you. One of the town's street urchins or perhaps the local drunk. I may be many things to many different people, but a~|~translationMissing
gossip I am not.~|~translationMissing
Ah! Here you go!~|~translationMissing
I need you to answer this for me.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a challenge scroll.)~|~translationMissing
Ali the Kebab seller has given you a challenge scroll!~|~translationMissing
Please give me your answer!~|~translationMissing
If the answer is wrong~|~translationMissing
Nope, not correct!~|~translationMissing
If the answer is correct~|~translationMissing
Spot on!~|~translationMissing

Ali the Leaflet Dropper~|~translationMissing
I don't have time to talk right now! Ali Morrisane is paying me to hand out these flyers.~|~translationMissing
Who is Ali Morrisane?~|~translationMissing
Ali Morrisane is the greatest merchant in the east!~|~translationMissing
Were you paid to say that?~|~translationMissing
Of course I was! You can find him on the north edge of town.~|~translationMissing
What are the flyers for?~|~translationMissing
Well, Ali Morrisane isn't too popular with the other traders in Al Kharid, mainly because he's from Pollnivneach and they feel he has no business trading in their town.~|~translationMissing
I think they're just sour because he's better at making money than them.~|~translationMissing
The flyer advertises the different shops you can find in Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
It also entitles you to money off your next purchase in any of the shops listed on it. It's Ali's way of getting on the good side of the traders.~|~translationMissing
Which shops?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an Al kharid flyer~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Al kharid flyer.)~|~translationMissing
Here! Take one and let me get back to work.~|~translationMissing
I still have hundreds of these flyers to hand out, I wonder if my boss would notice if I quietly dumped them somewhere?~|~translationMissing
If the player already has an Al kharid flyer~|~translationMissing
Are you trying to be funny or has age turned your brain to mush? Look at the flyer you already have!~|~translationMissing
I'd give you a flyer but it looks like your hands are full. Come back when you have space for my flyer.~|~translationMissing
What is there to do round here, boy?~|~translationMissing
I'm very busy, so listen carefully! I shall say this only once.~|~translationMissing
Apart from a busy and wonderous market place in Al Kharid to the south, there is the Emir's Arena to the south-east where you can challenge other players to a fight.~|~translationMissing
If you're here to make money, there is a mine to the south.~|~translationMissing
Watch out for scorpions though, they'll take a pop at you if you go too near them. To avoid them just follow the western fence as you travel south.~|~translationMissing
If you're in the mood for a little rest and relaxation, there are a couple of nice fishing spots south of the town.~|~translationMissing
Using a leaflet on Ali the Leaflet Dropper~|~translationMissing
I don't want this! It's out of date!~|~translationMissing
Then why would I want it? Keep moving, I have to hand all these flyers out before I get paid.~|~translationMissing

Hello good sir.~|~translationMissing
I'm new in town and wanted to get to know the locals.~|~translationMissing
You will have to be a lot more specific if you want help finding him. Everyone here is called Ali.~|~translationMissing
I've discovered that. Well he has an uncle called Ali Morrisane, a market vendor in Al Kharid and that's all I really know about him.~|~translationMissing
Say no more. I too am looking for him. The little tyke robbed me too, if we work together perhaps we can catch him and teach him a lesson.~|~translationMissing
Hello there! Who is this?~|~translationMissing
Ali~|~translationMissing
Ali.~|~translationMissing
Any particular Ali?~|~translationMissing
Only the best there is! I'm Ali the Sandsweeper.~|~translationMissing
You sweep sand?~|~translationMissing
Certainly do!  I'm the best darn sandsweeper this side of the Lum.~|~translationMissing
There's more of you?~|~translationMissing
We have a union, mate! There's always sand to sweep.~|~translationMissing
Indeed. Um, I have to go.~|~translationMissing
Ali the Smith~|~translationMissing
You seem rather cheerful. Is there anything you're after?~|~translationMissing
Well, it's hot and full of sand.~|~translationMissing
Don't ask me, I'm not from around here.~|~translationMissing
So where are you from?~|~translationMissing
A town to the south of the Shantay Pass, called Pollnivneach.~|~translationMissing
Not very much, at the moment. I came from further south to set up a smithy here...~|~translationMissing
...but we still haven't set up the shops, so we have no customers yet.~|~translationMissing
Yes, he's the one who persuaded us to come here.~|~translationMissing
He said we'd have lots of customers once we set up our shops, and all he asks for is a cut of the profits.~|~translationMissing
What? Who's spreading that rumour?~|~translationMissing
Well, one of the shopkeepers told me a man with a large hammer came to threaten them.~|~translationMissing
Don't pay any attention to those people.~|~translationMissing
They're just worried that they'll lose money when we open our shops.~|~translationMissing
Wow, a snake charmer! Can I have a go? Can I have a go? Please?~|~translationMissing
The snake charmer is focusing intently on his music and doesn't seem to notice you.~|~translationMissing
The snake charmer snaps out of his trance and directs his full attention to you.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough space in the inventory~|~translationMissing
Ali the Snake Charmer~|~translationMissing
If it means that you'll leave me alone, I will happily give you my snake charming super starter kit, complete with flute and basket. But you're clearly over burdened as it is.~|~translationMissing
If the player already owns a flute~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see you've lost your basket. Here you are, now leave me alone! You're ruining the show.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a snake basket.)~|~translationMissing
If the player already owns a basket~|~translationMissing
Ah, I see you've lost your snake charming flute. Here you go, now leave me alone! You're distracting my punters... er, I mean, crowd.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a snake flute.)~|~translationMissing
If the player does not own either~|~translationMissing
If you're that desperate to try, have my patented snake charming starter kit. It comes with a special snake charming flute and a basket to keep your charmed snakes in. Now, leave me alone!~|~translationMissing
The snake charmer gives you a snake charming flute and a basket.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a snake flute and snake basket.)~|~translationMissing
If the player already owns both the flute and basket~|~translationMissing
I'm not stopping you! You have your own snake charming flute.~|~translationMissing
I want to talk to you about animal charming.~|~translationMissing
If the player no longer owns a music scroll~|~translationMissing
I've lost some of the gear you gave me.~|~translationMissing
I've lost the music.~|~translationMissing
There you go. Now if you don't mind I'm busy trying to charm this here snake.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a music scroll.)~|~translationMissing
If the player already owns a music scroll~|~translationMissing
Can you teach me any more about animal charming.~|~translationMissing
No, I doubt it. I believe your talents lie in other areas.~|~translationMissing

Ali the Tailor~|~translationMissing
I'm a little busy at the moment. What is it?~|~translationMissing
Oh, it has wonderful weather.~|~translationMissing
Wonderful? It's hot and dry all the time!~|~translationMissing
Not quite as hot as back home.~|~translationMissing
Where's home, then?~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's a town to the south of the pass, called Pollnivneach.~|~translationMissing
If I had cloth, patterns and customers, I'd be a tailor. As it is, I'm a tailor with nothing to do.~|~translationMissing
The silk merchant won't even sell me any silks, because he doesn't trust me!~|~translationMissing
No, no, it's all being dealt with.~|~translationMissing
Of course, he's the one who's going to obtain cloth and clothes patterns so I can set up shop here.~|~translationMissing
And in such a good location, too. Not out of the way like back home.~|~translationMissing
The customers will soon pour in!~|~translationMissing
Why not? He's always happy to talk to potential business partners.~|~translationMissing
Me, threaten people?~|~translationMissing
One of the shopkeepers did say they were threatened by a man with large scissors...~|~translationMissing
Oh, them. Don't mind them. I think they're worried about what effect our shops will have.~|~translationMissing
For all they know, when we open our shops their wares will look cheap and shabby by comparison!~|~translationMissing
Ali the Tea Seller~|~translationMissing
Welcome! I'm Ali, and this is my tea shop! Is there anything I can do for you today?~|~translationMissing
Hmm... Could I get some tea?~|~translationMissing
Of course! I'll get the water boiling at once. Is there anything else I can do for you while you wait?~|~translationMissing
How's the tea coming along?~|~translationMissing
Oh! Yes, the water is boiling. Just give me a minute!~|~translationMissing
I'm so thirsty.~|~translationMissing
I know, the desert is forever hot. Thirsty work here!~|~translationMissing
How's business here? Seems quite out the way.~|~translationMissing
Not good?~|~translationMissing
It's not that. It's just that I've been having issues with a few thieves lately. Four to be precise!~|~translationMissing
They've been stealing your tea?~|~translationMissing
There have been a few break-ins. A recent shipment from Karamja has been taken! That was some of the finest stuff I've ever managed to get my hands on.~|~translationMissing
That's awful. If I see any shifty characters, I'll be sure to teach them a lesson.~|~translationMissing
Ha! Very courageous, adventurer! These thieves are big and brutish. I wouldn't start something you may not be able to finish.~|~translationMissing
I'm pretty tough. I think I can handle them.~|~translationMissing
I'd best be heading off.~|~translationMissing
You're leaving? But the tea is almost done!~|~translationMissing
I've been waiting quite a while. Perhaps another time.~|~translationMissing
Well you never actually made me that tea...~|~translationMissing
Ah yes! I'll get the water boiling at once. Is there anything else I can do for you while you wait?~|~translationMissing

Alice the Camel~|~translationMissing
Nothing, nothing.~|~translationMissing
Well, don't interrupt me, I've got work to do.~|~translationMissing
Really? What sort of work?~|~translationMissing
I'm participating in the construction of a shopping and sales extravaganza!~|~translationMissing
My masters have me hauling boxes around. There's not much to do at the moment, though.~|~translationMissing
Are your masters those men called Ali?~|~translationMissing
Yes, that's them. They're traders working for Ali Morrisane.~|~translationMissing
So, what's it like working for your masters?~|~translationMissing
It's hard work sometimes, but it could be worse.~|~translationMissing
I heard about a pair of camels back in Pollnivneach who were poisoned!~|~translationMissing
They say someone put spicy sauce in their food.~|~translationMissing
Really? That's very cruel of whoever did it.~|~translationMissing
I sincerely hope whoever did it was punished. Do they have no compassion for camels?~|~translationMissing

I suppose it is a little different to the places your type are used to...~|~translationMissing
This is my humble little hideaway! Plenty of fish around to sustain a man like me, with the help of my trusty cormorant.~|~translationMissing
A bird helps you to fish?~|~translationMissing
Sure she does! I haven't used a rod in years, just send her out to the waters and she takes care of it for me!~|~translationMissing
Could I have a go with your bird?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, I doubt that your type's up to the task...~|~translationMissing
But it would be quite the amusing sight. Go on!~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have anything equipped in gloves or weapon slot.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep an eye on you and make sure you don't have too much trouble with her!~|~translationMissing
Alry equips the player with the Cormorant's glove.~|~translationMissing
If the player has something equipped in gloves or weapon slot~|~translationMissing
You're going to need to free up your hands first, though. Nothing in or on your hands.~|~translationMissing
I don't think that's for me.~|~translationMissing
I don't think that's for me... I'll leave that to you.~|~translationMissing
No surprises there! Your type never have been cut out for it.~|~translationMissing
What's in the sack?~|~translationMissing
Oh, this? This is my trusty old fish sack!~|~translationMissing
Fish sack?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, fish sack! I might sell you one if you've found any of those pearls around here.~|~translationMissing

Now that is a biggun! How she managed to wrangle one like that I'll never know.~|~translationMissing
If you don't want it, I could take it off your hands for a few of those pearls!~|~translationMissing
I'm interested... How many pearls are we talking?~|~translationMissing
I'll give you a hundred pearls for it. What do you say?~|~translationMissing
Trade in your golden tench for 100 molch pearls?~|~translationMissing
It's a deal.~|~translationMissing
No, keep the tench.~|~translationMissing
On seconds thoughts, I'd rather keep it.~|~translationMissing
Yes, exchange the golden tench.~|~translationMissing
Pleasure doing business with you!~|~translationMissing
Well, let me know if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Ah, it's you. How are you finding things?~|~translationMissing
It certainly is a challenge...~|~translationMissing

Not until you free up some inventory space.~|~translationMissing
Certainly.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives a Construction guide.)~|~translationMissing
Tell me about houses!~|~translationMissing
It all came out of the wizards' experiments. They found a way to fold space, so that they could pack many acres of land into an area only a foot across.~|~translationMissing
They created several folded-space regions across Gielinor. Each one contains hundreds of small plots where people can build houses.~|~translationMissing
Ah, so that's how everyone can have a house without them cluttering up the world!~|~translationMissing
Quite. The wizards didn't want to get bogged down in the business side of things so they hired me to sell the houses.~|~translationMissing
There are various other people across Gielinor who can help you furnish your house.~|~translationMissing
You should start by buying planks from a sawmill operator. Sawmills are located in north-east Varrock, the Woodcutting Guild located in south-west Hosidius and north-east Prifddinas.~|~translationMissing
(If player doesn't have level 99 Construction~|~translationMissing
) Tell me about that skillcape you're wearing.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about that skillcape you're wearing.~|~translationMissing
As you may know, skillcapes are only available to masters in a skill. I have spent my entire life building houses and now I spend my time selling them! As a sign of my abilities I wear this Skillcape of Construction.~|~translationMissing
If you ever have enough skill to build a demonic throne, come and talk to me and I'll sell you a skillcape like mine.~|~translationMissing
The Cape of Construction also provides you with as many teleports as you like to any of the house portals or even directly inside!~|~translationMissing
(If player has level 99 Construction~|~translationMissing
) Can you sell me a Skillcape of Construction?~|~translationMissing
Can you sell me a Skillcape of Construction?~|~translationMissing
Alright, that'll be 99000 coins, please. A small price to pay for such an illustrious cape that can teleport you to any of the house portals or even directly inside your house!~|~translationMissing
I'm not paying that!~|~translationMissing
Suit yourself. There are many other heroes who would love the opportunity to purchase one. You can find me here if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
Certainly, that sounds fair.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have at least 99,000 coins~|~translationMissing
Well, come back and see me when you do.~|~translationMissing

Hmm, yeah sorry about that. Speaking of carpets, ever thought how strange that there are carpets beneath the stairs?~|~translationMissing
It's cut to fit! If I had a gold piece for everytime I was asked that question!~|~translationMissing
Sure... Cut to fit... Not an oversight at all.~|~translationMissing
Alright, believe what you like. I've a castle to clean.~|~translationMissing
Are you the Alyssa this entry mentions?~|~translationMissing
You show her 'A Dark Disposition'.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I suppose I am.~|~translationMissing
Got anything to say about it?~|~translationMissing
Why should I tell you anything? There are private matters of a late royal family! It wouldn't be proper to divulge such information to an adventurer like you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not added all six missing pages of the memoir~|~translationMissing
...Most people don't know when to stop sharing. I guess you have a point though.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I do indeed. Off with you, I've had my fair share of nosy adventurers for one day.~|~translationMissing
Alright, sorry for disturbing you. Bye.~|~translationMissing
If the player has added all six pages of the memoir~|~translationMissing
...Most people don't know when to stop sharing. It's probably worth mentioning that I've found all entries of this memoir.~|~translationMissing
Yes, how did you come across this? I'm fairly certain it was destroyed... At least, I recall seeing a man removing the pages...~|~translationMissing
Honestly, I've never really questioned it. I do things for people and they give me things.~|~translationMissing
Well, I suppose if you've already nosily rifled through the princesses personal memoirs, I can tell you a little more.~|~translationMissing
Fantastic! I've got to say, there's some great little gems in this old book. I think I'm unravelling a great mystery!~|~translationMissing
Well, if I were you I'd keep shush on the whole matter.~|~translationMissing
You must be new here. When the king died, everyone assumed the princess would take the throne when she came of age.~|~translationMissing
But the council kept control...~|~translationMissing
Indeed, and poor young Rose was shipped off and labelled as crazy.~|~translationMissing
I do very much miss her, but one can't change the past.~|~translationMissing
What if I were to say she's still out there! Read this entry that I found hidden within a secret part of the memoir.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry adventurer, but what does this prove exactly? For all you know someone else wrote this to mislead you.~|~translationMissing
Ah, you do make a good point...~|~translationMissing
If she did write this I'm afraid to say she must be mad after all.~|~translationMissing
Are all adventurers as dense as you? If you were in danger, do you really think leaving a hidden message in an old lost book for any stranger to pick up is the best way to get help?~|~translationMissing
It's certainly peculiar, but it should be investigated regardless. Y'know, just in case...~|~translationMissing
Alright, spring the trap! Don't come crying to me when it all turns sour.~|~translationMissing
Don't you worry! I'm a brave adventurer with a damsel in distress to rescue! This is my bread and butter.~|~translationMissing
Yes, yes, of course. Well, I'd be glad to hear of her being safe but perhaps you should heed the warning.~|~translationMissing
Which warning?~|~translationMissing
Tread carefully.~|~translationMissing
Oh, of course! Thanks for chatting with me Alyssa, I'll see you around.~|~translationMissing
Farewell.~|~translationMissing
You! I should have known this would be your doing!~|~translationMissing
It's over, Amascut! Your plan has failed.~|~translationMissing
My plan has only just begun! Even with this setback, those pathetic fragments of my father have still given me ample power. My strength is absolute!~|~translationMissing
Maybe, but it doesn't matter. I've stopped every one of your schemes so far, and I'll stop the next one as well.~|~translationMissing
Really? You think you're leaving this place alive? I can promise you that won't be the case! My father's weapons have given me his power, and now they'll finally rid me of you!~|~translationMissing
Are you ready for the final challenge?~|~translationMissing
Amascut activates the obelisk and teleports away.~|~translationMissing

It's funny... whenever we dwarves have ventured onto the surface, we've found ourselves at war with the goblins there.~|~translationMissing
But now we meet these goblins underground, and they're no threat at all. Maybe this will herald a change in our relations with the surface goblins as well.~|~translationMissing
I can't stand these goblins sometimes! I come up with suggestions to make their city more efficient, and they just say it would spoil their precious way of life!~|~translationMissing
Trade with the goblins is going well at the moment. It's a pity they don't seem as interested in our beer as in your food, though!~|~translationMissing
Thank you again for helping us complete the train link. Further delays would have cost the Consortium a lot of money.~|~translationMissing
Oh, and I hear you saved someone's life as well. Well done on that count too.~|~translationMissing
I miss Keldagrim. This city is all very well, but no one makes an underground city like the dwarves!~|~translationMissing

Well, in theory, but he always seems to be busy.~|~translationMissing

What are you waiting for?~|~translationMissing
I have been waiting for an audience with the King for days!~|~translationMissing
Well, he's clearly a busy man.~|~translationMissing
Bah! I think he's just trying to insult the gnome nation, by making me wait. The cheek of these humans. Just because they're vertically challenged they think they can ignore us.~|~translationMissing
I'm not ignoring you.~|~translationMissing
Hmm. I should be thankful for small mercies, I suppose.~|~translationMissing
Many thanks. This will help wile away the time whilst I'm waiting for an audience.~|~translationMissing

Well, it is the White Knights' Castle.~|~translationMissing
I think it would all look better in a nice dark green. At least then I wouldn't be squinting all the time.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but then they'd have to become the Dark Green Knights. Doesn't really have the same ring to it.~|~translationMissing
Bah, humans have no sense of style...~|~translationMissing
You hand over your delivery of a/some [ordered gnome food item] to Ambassador Spanfipple.~|~translationMissing
Thank you kindly. I haven't got used to this human food and drink yet.~|~translationMissing

I think it would all look better in pink. At least then I wouldn't be squinting all the time.~|~translationMissing
Yes, but then they'd have to become the Pink Knights. I think they'd have problems recruiting then.~|~translationMissing
You're probably right. Maybe brown, then.~|~translationMissing

Nope. Just thought I'd say hi.~|~translationMissing
Well Shayzien was founded by those fleeing the Dragonkin Conflicts. And the city has never been short of heroes. There's a good chance she was from Shayzien.~|~translationMissing
No but that's not surprising. Most of our history was lost during Xeric's reign. There is somewhere you might find answers though.~|~translationMissing
Let me guess. There's a catch isn't there?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid so. For hundreds of years, the crypts have been overrun by the dead. We've tried clearing them out but they just come back again.~|~translationMissing
Well thankfully I'm afraid of no ghost. Where do I start?~|~translationMissing
They're zombies, not ghosts. You'll find the entrance to the crypts in the Graveyard of Heroes, south of our chapel. Be careful.~|~translationMissing
The most likely place to find answers is the Shayzien Crypts. You'll find the entrance in the Graveyard of Heroes, south of our chapel. Be careful, it's filled with zombies.~|~translationMissing

I'm the founder of Mahogany Homes, Gielinor's first Construction company!~|~translationMissing
We've currently got branches in Falador, Varrock, Hosidius and Ardougne.~|~translationMissing
So people contact you for help with their homes?~|~translationMissing
Yep! They'll get in contact if they want assistance, whether it's fixing parts of their house or requesting nicer furniture, and then we will go and help them out.~|~translationMissing
That sounds quite enjoyable and satisfying to do, are you hiring at all?~|~translationMissing
If you have the supplies, I can tell you where one of our clients is that needs some work doing.~|~translationMissing
I'll keep track of the work you do as well and give you some points for our company reward shop.~|~translationMissing
Also there are assistants in Varrock, Ardougne, and Hosidius that can give you work, if Falador is inconvienent for you.~|~translationMissing
The clients that I would offer you to go help could be in any of those cities, it might be a bit of a journey to get there!~|~translationMissing
I'd like a construction contract.~|~translationMissing
What kind of contract would you like?~|~translationMissing
Beginner Contract~|~translationMissing
Could I have a beginner contract please?~|~translationMissing
Please could you go see [client] [area] [city], [location description] for us? You can get another job once you have furnished [his/her] home.~|~translationMissing

How is the company doing?~|~translationMissing
Pretty good, we've only opened up recently and already have 12 clients!~|~translationMissing
These clients are quite indecisive about what they want their houses to look like though, I'm not complaining.~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed at least one contract~|~translationMissing
Yeah I've noticed that they seem to keep breaking hatstands all the time too, I'm not sure how easy it is to break a hatstand...~|~translationMissing
Very bizarre.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad you're doing well!~|~translationMissing
(If the player is wearing a construction cape~|~translationMissing
) Why don't you have a construction cape?~|~translationMissing
Why don't you have a construction cape if you're a master builder?~|~translationMissing
Well why do you have one?~|~translationMissing
The teleports on it are really handy.~|~translationMissing
Why would a cape for construction use magic? That seems a bit illogical doesn't it?~|~translationMissing
We are people of hard work, not ones that rely on wizardry!~|~translationMissing

Of?~|~translationMissing
I... I don't know. I can't remember.~|~translationMissing
We came here to fight. But I don't know who for. It's like it was moments ago, but also a lifetime in the past.~|~translationMissing
Do you know who you were fighting against?~|~translationMissing
No. We were here to claim something. To protect it. But everything else is unclear.~|~translationMissing
I'm sorry, this is all so confusing. I need some time to try and understand.~|~translationMissing
Well I hope it all works out for you. Good luck.~|~translationMissing

Hello there. Want to travel to Slepe? I charge 10,000 coins for the journey.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have at least 10,000 coins~|~translationMissing
Doesn't look like you have enough money. I charge 10,000 coins for the journey.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 10,000 coins~|~translationMissing
Player gives Andras 10,000 coins.~|~translationMissing
Andras transports the player to Slepe.~|~translationMissing
Where's Slepe?~|~translationMissing
It's a small village to the south of here. You can walk but the boat is safer and faster.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything to do there?~|~translationMissing
I guess that depends what interests you. The place is pretty quiet, though there's been rumours recently of a great evil making its home beneath the village.~|~translationMissing
There's also Ver Sinhaza to the south, home to the Theatre of Blood. It's definitely worth having a look around, even if you don't intend to participate yourself.~|~translationMissing
So, do you want to go to Slepe?~|~translationMissing
Why is it so expensive?~|~translationMissing
Not many people want to visit this part of the world so I have to keep the price high. If I didn't I wouldn't be able to keep my boat maintained.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not paid Andras 1,000,000 coins for permanent access~|~translationMissing
) I'll give you 1,000,000 coins for permanent access.~|~translationMissing
I'll give you 1,000,000 coins for permanent access.~|~translationMissing
1,000,000 coins! Are you serious?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have at least 1,000,000 coins~|~translationMissing
No. I don't have that sort of money.~|~translationMissing
Oh, I see. So, do you want to go to Slepe?~|~translationMissing
If the player does has at least 1,000,000 coins~|~translationMissing
Yes. Here's 1,000,000 coins.~|~translationMissing
Player gives Andras 1,000,000 coins.~|~translationMissing
You pay Andras 1,000,000 coins for for[sic] permanent access to his boat.~|~translationMissing
Thank you so much. Now, do you want to go to Slepe?~|~translationMissing
No. That's too much for me to spend.~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Want to travel to Slepe?~|~translationMissing
Hello there. Want to return to Port Phasmatys?~|~translationMissing
Andras transports the player to Port Phasmatys.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything to do around here?~|~translationMissing
Well you have Slepe just north of here. It's mostly a quiet place, though there's been rumours recently of a great evil making its home beneath the village.~|~translationMissing
There's also Ver Sinhaza. You can find it south of here. There's a gap in the northern wall that you can get through.~|~translationMissing
What's Ver Sinhaza?~|~translationMissing
It's a large vampyric castle, home to the Theatre of Blood. The vampyres claim that the Theatre is one of the greatest combat challenges around. Definitely worth a look even if you don't want to participate.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, did you want to return to Port Phasmatys?~|~translationMissing

Well met, fellow adventurer.~|~translationMissing
Andros Mai~|~translationMissing
Adventurer? I am no mere Adventurer, I am Andros Mai, brother of the Holy Order of Saradomin. You would do well to greet me with respect.~|~translationMissing
Andros Mai? Sorry, but I can't say I've heard of you I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't have expected someone of your... stature to know of me.~|~translationMissing
Tell me, what do you know of the vile Vet'ion?~|~translationMissing
With no Vet'ion kills~|~translationMissing
Nothing, but I have a feeling you're about to fill me in.~|~translationMissing
With at least one Vet'ion kill~|~translationMissing
We've crossed swords in the past, I can't say I'm too keen to do it again though.~|~translationMissing
You challenged him and came out unscathed? Impossible.~|~translationMissing
I'm stronger than I look.~|~translationMissing
But why do you ask? What do you want with Vet'ion?~|~translationMissing
Vet'ion was a devout follower of the heretical god Zamorak. It is the will of my order and my duty as a follower of the true god Saradomin to end his tyranny.~|~translationMissing
After many years in my order's libraries, I stumbled upon an old tome which mentioned Vet'ion's final resting place, which I believe to be his source of power.~|~translationMissing
His very existence is an insult to my lord Saradomin and I will not suffer it to exist any longer.~|~translationMissing
Then why are you waiting here? Seems to me that you don't want to face Vet'ion.~|~translationMissing
I have no fear of Vet'ion!~|~translationMissing
I am merely meditating and preparing for the battle. I need to focus my mind before going out to find his resting place.~|~translationMissing
It's okay, sometimes I pretend to be busy when there's something I don't want to do, too.~|~translationMissing
This conversation is over! Leave me before I lose my temper.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has Viggora's chainmace or the Claws of Callisto~|~translationMissing
) Ask about rare item.~|~translationMissing
With only Viggora's chainmace in the inventory~|~translationMissing
Hey. Do you know anything about this?~|~translationMissing
You show the chainmace to Andros Mai.~|~translationMissing
By Saradomin! That's a Zamorakian made chainmace you have there!~|~translationMissing
And? Do you know anything about it?~|~translationMissing
I know melee weapons in general. Well enough to know most of them can be upgraded.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps with something sharp to give it more impact as it swings around.~|~translationMissing
Interesting! I'll be on the lookout for a powerful enhancement like that.~|~translationMissing
With only the Claws of Callisto in the inventory~|~translationMissing
You show the claws to Andros Mai.~|~translationMissing
They look like powerful claws. You could probably attach them to a weapon to make the weapon stronger.~|~translationMissing
Interesting! I'll be on the lookout for that.~|~translationMissing
With both in the inventory~|~translationMissing
Perhaps I could use this?~|~translationMissing
You show the Claws of callisto to Andros Mai.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Those look like they could be attached to the weapon.~|~translationMissing
Could you combine them?~|~translationMissing
While I could, I'd really not like to.~|~translationMissing
Surely you could consider it... For the right price?~|~translationMissing
Money has been tight lately...~|~translationMissing
And my supplies are running low...~|~translationMissing
Fine. But I want 500,000 coins for that. No less.~|~translationMissing
Pay 500,000 coins to combine the claws and chainmace?~|~translationMissing
I don't have the money for that.~|~translationMissing
Feel free to come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
Andros Mai combines the items and gives you the Ursine chainmace (u).~|~translationMissing
There we go! All done.~|~translationMissing
You show the fangs to Andros Mai.~|~translationMissing
No. I'm afraid not. They just look like fangs.~|~translationMissing
Fangs indeed. Rather useless it seems.~|~translationMissing
Perhaps not. I've seen that Derse Venator guy over there handle similar items. Perhaps he knows more.~|~translationMissing
You show the skull to Andros Mai.~|~translationMissing
That's him! The vile Vet'Ion. I should like to smash this skull!~|~translationMissing
Wait! It seems to still contain some magic. Surely we can use it?~|~translationMissing
The only thing his skull would be useful for is Zamorakian heresy. I won't stand for it!~|~translationMissing
Is there really nothing you can do to help me with this?~|~translationMissing
Do you see Phabelle over there? Despite her questionable morals, she's my friend.~|~translationMissing
She's good with magic and may know how to take advantage of the powers in that skull.~|~translationMissing
You show the weapon piece to Andros Mai.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm afraid not.~|~translationMissing
Oh. Do you know someone who might know more?~|~translationMissing
Downstairs you can find Madam Sikaro. Though she's on the wrong path, perhaps she could assist you.~|~translationMissing

I'm sorry about what happened to Glough, Anita.~|~translationMissing
Glough was deeply troubled, [player name]. Fortunately Carado has helped me move on.~|~translationMissing
Anja~|~translationMissing
Hello sir. What are you doing in my house?~|~translationMissing
I'm just wandering around.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, are you lost?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm lost.~|~translationMissing
Okay, just walk north-east when you leave this house, and soon you'll reach the big city of Falador.~|~translationMissing
No, I know where I am.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Well, would you mind wandering somewhere else? This is my house.~|~translationMissing
Meh!~|~translationMissing
I was hoping you'd give me some free stuff.~|~translationMissing
Do you REALLY need it?~|~translationMissing
I don't have much on me...~|~translationMissing
(beg beg beg beg beg beg)~|~translationMissing
I promise I'll stop bothering you!~|~translationMissing
Pleeease!~|~translationMissing
Pwetty pleathe wiv thugar on top!~|~translationMissing
Oh, alright. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 1?3 coins.)~|~translationMissing
I've come to kill you.~|~translationMissing
Eeeek!~|~translationMissing
Hengel~|~translationMissing
Aaaarrgh!~|~translationMissing
The dwarf lady seems to be looking for someone.~|~translationMissing
Anleif~|~translationMissing
Hello, I'm looking for my husband. Have you seen him?~|~translationMissing
What does he look like?~|~translationMissing
Oh, to pot with this silly charade, I'm down here to try and win big on the moggies.~|~translationMissing
Hang on, I thought you were looking for your husband.~|~translationMissing
Um no, I was just pretending. It's frowned on a little to be seen in these parts.~|~translationMissing
So how do these rat pits work?~|~translationMissing
The Keldagrim pits cater for those with the larger variety of cats.~|~translationMissing
If you have an overgrown cat and a couple of coins you can challenge someone else who also has an overgrown cat and some spare change.~|~translationMissing
That sounds simple enough so far.~|~translationMissing
You then agree on a wager. It's rumoured that some ratcatchers can talk to their own cats and give them tactics to aid them.~|~translationMissing
So then how do you win the challenge?~|~translationMissing
I was just getting to that. Both the challengers' cats are placed inside the arena, and whichever kills 9 rats first wins.~|~translationMissing
That sounds vile and cruel.~|~translationMissing
It's a cruel world and the pits are no exception.~|~translationMissing
Each to their own, I say.~|~translationMissing
One more thing...~|~translationMissing
Thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
It sounds a little dangerous for my cat.~|~translationMissing
I agree. Cats have been known to be killed in fights.~|~translationMissing
Oh how terrible. Is there nothing you can do to save your cat?~|~translationMissing
Of course there is, you can instruct it to be cautious, and it will leave once it feels as if it is in danger.~|~translationMissing
Oh that sounds quite wise.~|~translationMissing
That depends on how you value your cat.~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't follow.~|~translationMissing
Well if your cat dies or it runs away you lose.~|~translationMissing
So the longer it stays in the fight the better chance you have of winning.~|~translationMissing
Wow that sounds like fun.~|~translationMissing
Wow that sounds like fun!~|~translationMissing
I don't know about that.~|~translationMissing
One thing I know though is that it's a quick way to make and lose money.~|~translationMissing
Is there a limit to how much you can bet?~|~translationMissing
Hmmm... let me think. I don't think that's ever arisen but I think it's 20,000.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, that sounds like a silly amount of money to bet on a cat fight.~|~translationMissing
You'd be surprised what some people would be willing to bet.~|~translationMissing
There is a minimum bet of 100 coins too.~|~translationMissing
Can I challenge you and your cat?~|~translationMissing
No, not now, we don't really bet with outsiders.~|~translationMissing
But I'm not an outsider, am I not inside in the pits now?~|~translationMissing
I don't know, maybe once you've done something to win over my trust.~|~translationMissing
Can it be bought?~|~translationMissing
Your trust.~|~translationMissing
No. Regular townsfolk don't like us, which leads us to distrust them and anyone else.~|~translationMissing

Hello visitor, how are you?~|~translationMissing
Better than expected. It's a lot...nicer...here than I was expecting. Everyone seems pretty happy.~|~translationMissing
Of course, the Burgher is strong and wise, and looks after us well.~|~translationMissing

Annette~|~translationMissing
Can I help you with drift net storage, human?~|~translationMissing
My aunt lets people come in here to catch the fish. Sometimes they have trouble carrying enough stuff, so I help by holding onto spare drift nets for them.~|~translationMissing
(Annette's Nets interface interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Anti-Santa~|~translationMissing
Ha Ha Ha. Well if it isn't [player name], why do you dare enter my domain....~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed any Christmas event involving Anti-Santa~|~translationMissing
Long time no see Anti-Santa, how's prison life been treating you?~|~translationMissing
It has been glorious, you may have thought me to be rotting inside these walls, but I've been coming up with plot to end Christmas once and for all!~|~translationMissing
You may of [sic] stopped me all those years ago, but you didn't stop my mind.~|~translationMissing
Soon I'll escape these walls and there'll be naught to stop me.~|~translationMissing
This pathetic holiday will come to an end and I'll laugh as it burns.~|~translationMissing
That red buffoon will not be able to stop me, nor you, nor that dumb cat!~|~translationMissing
If the player has not completed any Christmas event involving Anti-Santa~|~translationMissing
Anti-Santa, Santa told me all about you.~|~translationMissing
Don't mention his name to me, he's everything I hate about this repulsive holiday, I have always dreamed about tearing down this revolting time of year.~|~translationMissing
Years ago I almost succeeded, but I was thwarted by that red buffoon and some dumb cat!~|~translationMissing
But in the years I've been locked away, I've been plotting and scheming. When I escape from this cell....~|~translationMissing
Yes, Christmas will never be the same, children will be crying instead of laughing!~|~translationMissing
The streets will be cold and lifeless.~|~translationMissing
I will stop Christmas once and for all!~|~translationMissing
And soon it will be the year of the Anti-Christmas!~|~translationMissing
*Snores*~|~translationMissing
OI!~|~translationMissing
*Wakes up* Oh sorry! You were going on for a bit, I thought it'd never end.~|~translationMissing
You've been moved to the top of my kill list [player name].~|~translationMissing
Let's cut to the chase, I need your help Anti-Santa.~|~translationMissing
Oh, so you've come begging to me for help, what makes you think I would help you?~|~translationMissing
What other choice do you have? It looks incredibly boring in this cell.~|~translationMissing
Well, that's true, but I'd rather that than help you.~|~translationMissing
You're so over dramatic. Santa said he'd consider freeing you only if you help us.~|~translationMissing
Oh did he... ...now might be my chance to escape this cell... you know what. I will help you.~|~translationMissing
Finally, he needs you to deal with Jack Frost at a bakery in Varrock.~|~translationMissing
Is that it? Why can't he do it himself?~|~translationMissing
He's testing a new parenting technique.~|~translationMissing
Really? How are we meant to get into this bakery?~|~translationMissing
He gave me this teleport tablet, it will take us right inside of the bakery.~|~translationMissing
After all these years, he's still making adventurers do his dirty work. He's just as bad as me.~|~translationMissing
Trust me, I'm getting tired of it as well, we need to go before it's too late.~|~translationMissing
Player uses teleport, fade to black, appears in workshop with Anti-Santa.~|~translationMissing
Ha Ha Ha If it isn't Jack Frost. You look smaller than last time I saw you.~|~translationMissing
Jack Frost~|~translationMissing
A-A-Anti Santa!? What are you doing here?~|~translationMissing
Your father sent me. Apparently, you've been rather naughty this year.~|~translationMissing
I'm here to sort you out.~|~translationMissing
What? My dad sent you? No way, he put me in charge of Christmas.~|~translationMissing
He did and apparently you're doing such an awful job of it, you've ruined it for everyone...~|~translationMissing
When you think about it, are you sure you're not my son?~|~translationMissing
You're not my father, you're just an ugly bag of bones.~|~translationMissing
I won't let you stop me. Take this!~|~translationMissing
Jack Frost casts Water Blast, dealing 0 damage.~|~translationMissing
Ha Ha Ha. Is that all you've got, Jack?~|~translationMissing
Oh come on! How did that not hurt you?~|~translationMissing
You're weak just like your father.~|~translationMissing
I'm gonna slap you back to Lumbridge!~|~translationMissing
Anti-Santa casts Fire Surge, dealing 60 damage.~|~translationMissing
You're going to need a lot worse to defeat me.~|~translationMissing
Good thing I'm not done yet.~|~translationMissing
I learned this from an old friend of mine.~|~translationMissing
Anti-Santa spews out fireballs akin to Vorkath's acid phase, while Jack Frost walks back and forth to dodge them.~|~translationMissing
You cannot stop me Jack.~|~translationMissing
I'm not finished yet.~|~translationMissing
Jack Frost casts Water Blast again, Anti-Santa reflects the blast back as Water Surge.~|~translationMissing
Jack Frost takes 9 damage.~|~translationMissing
I'm getting out of here. This isn't worth it!~|~translationMissing
Jack Frost teleports away.~|~translationMissing
Uhh...~|~translationMissing
That didn't go as planned.~|~translationMissing
Ha Ha Ha. He won't get away that easily!~|~translationMissing
I'll be back to deal with you soon [player name]....~|~translationMissing
Anti-Santa pulls off his head, it glows in a blue flame, and he fades away.~|~translationMissing
Anton~|~translationMissing
Ahhh, hello there. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
Looks like you have a good selection of weapons around here...~|~translationMissing
Indeed so, specially imported from the finest smiths around the lands, take a look at my wares.~|~translationMissing
(Warrior Guild Armoury interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
A fine selection of blades for you to peruse, come take a look!~|~translationMissing
Armours and axes to suit your needs.~|~translationMissing
Imported weapons from the finest smithys around the lands!~|~translationMissing
Ow my toe! That armour is heavy.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have silk in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Anwen~|~translationMissing
If the player has silk in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Hello. I have some fine silk from far away to sell to you.~|~translationMissing
Ah I may be interested in that. What sort of price were you looking at per piece of silk?~|~translationMissing
20 coins.~|~translationMissing
Ok suits me.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 20 coins.)~|~translationMissing
80 coins.~|~translationMissing
80 coins? That's a bit steep! How about 40 coins?~|~translationMissing
Ok, 40 sounds good.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 40 coins.)~|~translationMissing
50, and that's my final price.~|~translationMissing
Done.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 50 coins.)~|~translationMissing
No, that is not enough.~|~translationMissing
120 coins.~|~translationMissing
You'll never get that much for it. I'll be generous and give you 50 for it.~|~translationMissing
Ok, I guess 50 will do.~|~translationMissing
I'll give it to you for 60.~|~translationMissing
You drive a hard bargain, but I guess that will have to do.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives 60 coins.)~|~translationMissing
200 coins.~|~translationMissing
Don't be ridiculous! That is far too much. You insult me with that price.~|~translationMissing
If Anwen notices the player stealing from her stall~|~translationMissing
Hey! Get your hands off there!~|~translationMissing
If the player recently stole from Anwen and tries to talk to her~|~translationMissing
You're the one who stole something from me!~|~translationMissing

Apmeken~|~translationMissing
You did it! I wasn't sure I'd make it out of that one, but I'm glad you proved me wrong. Come, let's get out of here.~|~translationMissing
Hi there. How are you doing?~|~translationMissing
Oh, you know, just getting over years of being controlled by a deranged family member. All part of the fun in a family like ours, I guess.~|~translationMissing
You seem quite jolly about it all.~|~translationMissing
Well as I always say, 'the real winner is the one smiling.' What Amascut has done is horrific, but it's not too late to stop her. I won't let her get me down, not while there's still hope.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, I'm annoyingly a bit too weak to help you much down here. However, I reckon if you can free the others, we'll be able to open the way to the lower level for you.~|~translationMissing
We've been able to open the way for you! I wish we could help you down there, but we're still too weak. Don't worry though, I know you can do it!~|~translationMissing
Here he is!~|~translationMissing
Het~|~translationMissing
My friend, you managed what few have ever achieved. You overcame Amascut herself! I wish I could have been there to see it!~|~translationMissing
Well I couldn't have done it alone. Speaking of which, where's Scabaras?~|~translationMissing
Crondis~|~translationMissing
Scabaras walks his own path. Do not consider his absence an insult. This is his way.~|~translationMissing
Not to mention that he was under Amascut's control far longer than the rest of us. It will take him time to come to terms with his role in her plots.~|~translationMissing
Don't worry, he'll be okay. He always is.~|~translationMissing
Before we go any further... We didn't have much time for conversation back in the tomb. I'm sure you have some questions for us.~|~translationMissing
If you do, now is the time to ask them.~|~translationMissing
I have a question for Apmeken.~|~translationMissing
What's your role in the Menaphite Pantheon?~|~translationMissing
I'm Tumeken's avatar of companionship! Tumeken himself was always considered a bit cold, which is a tad ironic when you think about it.~|~translationMissing
A cold sun god?~|~translationMissing
Exactly! Bit odd, right? Still, although he wasn't exactly known for his social side, he still understood the importance of such things. That's why he made me!~|~translationMissing
My job is to make sure everyone remembers the importance of friendship. After all, we all need a friend or two, or ten, or maybe hundreds! Have as many as you want! I won't judge.~|~translationMissing
Why aren't there more monkeys or apes in the desert?~|~translationMissing
Ah, you can thank Amascut for that. The desert used to be home to thousands of apes and monkeys, but she targeted them to try and get to me.~|~translationMissing
Don't be! Now that I'm back, I know we can turn things around!~|~translationMissing
We'll be here when you're ready.~|~translationMissing
I have a question for Crondis.~|~translationMissing
I am Tumeken's avatar of resourcefulness.~|~translationMissing
Meaning my job is to guide the people of the desert not to live lives of excess.~|~translationMissing
Guessing you're not a fan of Menaphos then?~|~translationMissing
Much of the desert has forgotten the importance of modesty in my absence, but the situation in Menaphos is definitely the most concerning. Let us hope it can soon be rectified.~|~translationMissing
Why are crocodiles so rude?~|~translationMissing
Rude? How so.~|~translationMissing
Well they always try to eat me when I go near them.~|~translationMissing
The life of a crocodile is not an easy one. They must seek food wherever it is available.~|~translationMissing
Besides, I sense you do not speak the whole truth. Did you not befriend a crocodile yourself in times past?~|~translationMissing
You mean Roger! I guess he was quite friendly.~|~translationMissing
Then perhaps crocodiles are not as rude as you think.~|~translationMissing
We will be here.~|~translationMissing
I have a question for Het.~|~translationMissing
I am Tumeken's avatar of health, both physical and mental.~|~translationMissing
You talk about strength and fighting a lot. Surely fighting isn't good for someone's health.~|~translationMissing
Well when it comes to health, is strength not the ultimate goal? The strongest individual is one who is healthy in both body and mind, and what better way to celebrate that strength than in combat!~|~translationMissing
I guess, but what about those who aren't strong?~|~translationMissing
Well health is not something to be hoarded, is it? Most weaknesses can be overcome, and it is the duty of the strong to help those less fortunate.~|~translationMissing
So they can become strong and healthy themselves?~|~translationMissing
Do you have more followers than the others?~|~translationMissing
An interesting question. Why do you ask?~|~translationMissing
Considering you have a human appearance, I wondered if that might resonate more with people.~|~translationMissing
Not as much as you might think. Believe it or not, in some ways, I'm actually considered a bit boring! Why follow the human when you have a baboon god?~|~translationMissing
Especially when the baboon god is so fun to be around!~|~translationMissing
Of course, people just following one of us was never really the intention anyway. We're a pantheon, and we all have a part to play.~|~translationMissing
Now that Amascut is running with her tail between her legs, perhaps we can remind people of that.~|~translationMissing
We'll wait for you to return.~|~translationMissing
I have a question for all of you.~|~translationMissing
What will happen with Amascut?~|~translationMissing
I'd say that's up to her. If she doesn't change her ways, her fate won't be pretty.~|~translationMissing
But it's never too late for redemption. There might still be hope for her.~|~translationMissing
Whatever path she takes, we will be ready.~|~translationMissing
Do you really think she'd change her ways at this point?~|~translationMissing
It seems unlikely, but there is one who might be able to change that.~|~translationMissing
Icthlarin! If anyone can help Amascut find her way again, it's him!~|~translationMissing
He doesn't seem to have been doing much to help so far.~|~translationMissing
Icthlarin is limited in what he can do. His duties to the dead require constant attention.~|~translationMissing
Not to mention the pact!~|~translationMissing
Pact?~|~translationMissing
That is not for us to discuss.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, sorry. Maybe we should talk about something else.~|~translationMissing
Are you actually gods?~|~translationMissing
If you asked a citizen of these lands, I'm sure they'd probably say yes.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, but they would not be truly correct.~|~translationMissing
Tumeken made us using his own divine essence! Each of us is a piece of him!~|~translationMissing
But that does not make us gods. While great, our power is insignificant compared to a true god. That is why they are gone, and we remain.~|~translationMissing
So what are you really?~|~translationMissing
You might hear some refer to us as the Avatars of Tumeken. We'd consider that a more fitting title.~|~translationMissing
What about Icthlarin and Amascut?~|~translationMissing
Tumeken made them too. Difference is, they also have some of Elidinis' divine essence, making them a lot more powerful!~|~translationMissing
But again, they are not true gods.~|~translationMissing
Amascut was hoping to change that today, but you showed her where to stick that plan!~|~translationMissing
We are the Avatars of Tumeken, and the Kharidian Desert has been without guidance for too long. It is time we fixed that.~|~translationMissing
We're going to get started right away!~|~translationMissing
But don't worry, we don't intend to miss the fight against Amascut. I hope you'll stand alongside us when that day comes.~|~translationMissing
For now though, this is goodbye. We will meet again, human.~|~translationMissing
It was great to meet you. Thank you for helping us!~|~translationMissing
The avatars depart.~|~translationMissing
You're back!~|~translationMissing

Sad about that affair with young Romeo and Juliet...~|~translationMissing

Always did think he was a bit of a strange one...~|~translationMissing
Anyway! Life goes on and so does business! Can I do something for you?~|~translationMissing
Do you know a potion to make hair fall out?~|~translationMissing
I do indeed. I gave it to my mother. That's why I now live alone.~|~translationMissing

Screen shakes back and forth then blacks out~|~translationMissing
Blimey... you've been out for hours! Are you ok? People were tripping over you as they walked into the shop.~|~translationMissing
No, I'm having second thoughts now.~|~translationMissing
You show the Serum book to the Apothecary.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not traded the book to the Apothecary yet~|~translationMissing
Do you want to trade the diary yet? I'd like to pass the information on to the scientific community in Varrock.~|~translationMissing

Hello. What are you doing?~|~translationMissing
Apprentice~|~translationMissing
Cleaning, cleaning, always cleaning. This apprenticeship isn't all that it was cracked up to be.~|~translationMissing
Whose apprentice are you?~|~translationMissing
Oh, Aadeela, the sorceress upstairs, said she'd teach me magic, she did. And here I am scrubbing floors without a spell to help me.~|~translationMissing
I could cast a Water Blast or a Wind Blast spell?~|~translationMissing
I could cast a Water Blast or a Wind Blast spell to hurry things along if you'd like?~|~translationMissing
No, no, she'd kill me or worse if she knew I was using Magic to do chores. Her last apprentice - well I'd rather not say.~|~translationMissing
Oh go on, what happened to them?~|~translationMissing
They say she turned them into little spiders.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's too bad. I had better leave you to it.~|~translationMissing
Surely there must be upsides to the task?~|~translationMissing
Nope. Clean this, clean that. When I'm finished cleaning here I have to go help out in the garden.~|~translationMissing
What garden?~|~translationMissing
Oh, I shouldn't have told you.~|~translationMissing
You're right, you shouldn't have.~|~translationMissing
Well, if you don't mind then, I'm busy and have to get back to work.~|~translationMissing
Don't let me keep you.~|~translationMissing
Oh, you can talk to me. I can see you're having a bad day.~|~translationMissing
You know you're right. Nobody listens to me.~|~translationMissing
I can't blame them, all you do is whine.~|~translationMissing
The apprentice is clearly hurt and ignores you.~|~translationMissing
A sympathetic ear can do wonders.~|~translationMissing
Yes, if I just let my frustrations out, I'd feel a lot better. Now what was I saying?~|~translationMissing
I don't know. You were whining about something or other.~|~translationMissing
I don't know. You were whining about something or other. To tell you the truth, I wasn't really listening.~|~translationMissing
To tell you the truth, I wasn't really listening.~|~translationMissing
You mentioned something about the garden.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah, that dreadful garden of hers.~|~translationMissing
Where is it?~|~translationMissing
Oh, it's nowhere.~|~translationMissing
Well it's here, but not really. You see the sorceress is trying out some new type of compression magic.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that sounds interesting - so how does it work?~|~translationMissing
It would take too long to explain and, to be honest, I don't really understand how it works.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, but tell me, how do you get to the garden?~|~translationMissing
By magic! The sorceress did teach me one spell.~|~translationMissing
Wow, cast the spell on me. It will be good Magic training for you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not talked to Osman about the Sorceress's Garden~|~translationMissing
I can't do that now, I'm far too busy sweeping.~|~translationMissing
If the player has talked to Osman about the Sorceress's Garden~|~translationMissing
Oh you wouldn't mind?~|~translationMissing
Of course not. I'd be glad to help.~|~translationMissing
Okay, here goes! Remember, to return, just drink from the fountain.~|~translationMissing
Oh, that's nice. Well it's been great talking to you.~|~translationMissing
Hey apprentice, do you want to try out your teleport skills again?~|~translationMissing
Okay, here goes - and remember, to return just drink from the fountain.~|~translationMissing
Apprentice (medium)~|~translationMissing
The Apprentice gives you a reward token!~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you could repair my pouches.~|~translationMissing
I need 25 abyssal pearls to unlock the contact with the mage who knows how to repair a pouch. After the contact has been unlocked, it will cost you 1 abyssal pearl each time to repair the pouches.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough abyssal pearls in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I don't have enough abyssal pearls for that, I'm afraid.~|~translationMissing
If the player has enough abyssal pearls in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Pay 25 abyssal pearls to unlock the pouch repair?~|~translationMissing
Now bear with me whilst I contact the mage.~|~translationMissing
Apprentice Cordelia casts the NPC Contact spell.~|~translationMissing
Hello, can you hear me?~|~translationMissing
Quiet! Why do you all try to break my concentration?~|~translationMissing
OK. The contact has been set up.~|~translationMissing
It will cost you 1 abyssal pearl to repair the pouches.~|~translationMissing
Yes, that sounds fair.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have an abyssal pearl in their inventory~|~translationMissing
If the player has an abyssal pearl in their inventory~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have a degraded essence pouch~|~translationMissing
You don't seem to have any pouches in need of repair.~|~translationMissing
If the player has a degraded essence pouch~|~translationMissing
Bear with me whilst I make the contact for repairing the pouches.~|~translationMissing
Hi, it's me again.~|~translationMissing
Hello, I know you can hear me.~|~translationMissing
Ding Dong, Ding Dong. You can't keep me waiting.~|~translationMissing
I got someone here in need of a pouch repair.~|~translationMissing
OK...It's done.~|~translationMissing
Your pouches have been repaired.~|~translationMissing
We need to assemble rift guardian before those creatures arrive!~|~translationMissing

Hey, [player name]. Got any abyssal pearls you want to trade?~|~translationMissing
Let's see what you have.~|~translationMissing
I have my general store, but I also have a small collection of lanterns available, if that interests you?~|~translationMissing
Can I see your general items?~|~translationMissing
(Temple Supplies interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
Lanterns, you say?~|~translationMissing
Yes, powerful artefacts of The Abyss. We have accumulated a small collection of them from all of the fighting.~|~translationMissing
Do the wizards not use them in the fight against the abyss?~|~translationMissing
Absolutely not. We know how powerful they are, yet their magic is too unknown to us to risk using.~|~translationMissing
Could I have one to aid in the fight?~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I can't just give you one. We're under strict instructions to only provide lanterns to people who prove themselves as committed to the cause.~|~translationMissing
How committed does one have to be?~|~translationMissing
If you've fought the abyss enough to amass 1,500 abyssal pearls, that would be enough.~|~translationMissing
Ah, I don't have enough on me right now.~|~translationMissing
That's alright. Feel free to come back when you have more pearls on you.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 1,500 abyssal pearls in their inventory~|~translationMissing
As long as you are aware of how powerful they are, and that I can trust you won't lost it.~|~translationMissing
I understand how powerful these are, I'd like to buy one.~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure I'm ready to buy one yet.~|~translationMissing
What's that rift guardian doing over there?~|~translationMissing
They're great, aren't they? I don't know their name, if they even have one, so I just call them Rifty.~|~translationMissing
That rift they have is a folded-space storage rift, just like the ones Traiborn uses! Small on the outside, but big on the inside!~|~translationMissing
But what's the rift for?~|~translationMissing
The guardians use it to store things. If you help hold back the Abyss, they'll let you take things from the rift in return.~|~translationMissing
Anyway, did you want to trade?~|~translationMissing
Why are you selling things here?~|~translationMissing
Sedridor told us to make sure there was plenty of incentive for people to help us. He also wants us to gather abyssal pearls for research purposes. I thought this would be a good way of doing both!~|~translationMissing
So you sell things in exchange for abyssal pearls?~|~translationMissing
Exactly! I've got some interesting things from the Wizards' Tower, along with some cool stuff the Guardians of the Rift gave us. Want to take a look?~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about this place.[sic]~|~translationMissing
Could you tell me more about this place.~|~translationMissing
Well, I only really know what the Great Guardian told us. This is the Temple of the Eye, or at least, what's left of it. It was built long ago to house the Eye, a powerful Saradominist artefact.~|~translationMissing
Apparently, servants of some 'Fallen Empire' desired this artefact. However, in their attempt to steal it, they accidently opened a rift into a deadly area of the Abyss called the Scar.~|~translationMissing
Were it not for the Justiciar of the Lion, the rift would have endangered all of Gielinor. She used the Eye to close it and then created the Guardians of the Rift to protect this temple.~|~translationMissing
Of course, the rift is open again now, but with our help, the Guardians of the Rift are keeping it under control.~|~translationMissing
(If the player is holding a dye~|~translationMissing
) I found this dye in the rewards rift...~|~translationMissing
I found this dye in the rewards rift...~|~translationMissing
And you want me to change it to a different one?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but how did you know?~|~translationMissing
Well, yes, but how did you know?~|~translationMissing
You'd be surprised at how often this happens. Lots of adventurers have been pulling bottles of dye out of that rift, only to wish they'd got a different one. I've ended up with plenty of spares.~|~translationMissing
So on that note, would you like me to swap your dye for you?~|~translationMissing
(If the player has abyssal red dye~|~translationMissing
) I'd like to swap my abyssal red dye for some abyssal green dye.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to swap my abyssal red dye for some abyssal green dye.~|~translationMissing

Not a problem. Feel free to come back if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing
No, I'd like to sell it to you.~|~translationMissing
Oh? Usually I trade them for other dyes, I suppose I could buy one from you instead for my own research.~|~translationMissing
Which dye did you want to sell?~|~translationMissing
(If the player lost an item~|~translationMissing
) I lost an item from the rewards rift.~|~translationMissing
I lost an item from the rewards rift.~|~translationMissing
What was the item?~|~translationMissing
(If the player lost the Tarnished locket~|~translationMissing
) A locket.~|~translationMissing
A locket.~|~translationMissing
It's funny you should mention that. I actually found an old locket while rummaging through the rift myself.~|~translationMissing
I'd happily give it to you, but you don't have space for it. Come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
Felix gives you the tarnished locket.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, Felix!~|~translationMissing
(If the player lost the Lost bag~|~translationMissing
) A bag.~|~translationMissing
A bag.~|~translationMissing

33.~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you could do something for me while I work to close the rift.~|~translationMissing
What is it? The rift will open soon and we should all be preparing to close it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has not asked to have the barrier locked~|~translationMissing
I was wondering if you could close the barrier so that other adventurers don't interfere with us closing the rift.~|~translationMissing
Why would you want to do that? Wouldn't more help be appreciated?~|~translationMissing
I believe that we already have what it takes to close the rift and I wouldn't want any other adventurers getting in the way.~|~translationMissing
I'll close the barrier once the rift opens. If you change your mind before the rift opens I can revert this.~|~translationMissing
If the player asked to have the barrier locked~|~translationMissing
I've changed my mind, we should allow other adventurers to join us in closing the rift.~|~translationMissing
I'll no longer close the barrier once the rift opens.~|~translationMissing
If the player is on a themed world for Guardians of the Rift~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure that would be a good idea right now.~|~translationMissing
You cannot lock this minigame on a Guardians of the Rift themed world.~|~translationMissing
The essence piles here contain lots of rift guardian parts.~|~translationMissing
Remember to combine guardian fragments with pure essence!~|~translationMissing
The cells here can be used to power up barriers and rift guardians!~|~translationMissing
Take uncharged cells with you to charge them at altars!~|~translationMissing
Don't forget that different cells produce different rift guardians!~|~translationMissing
Imbued essence can only be made at altars. Keep an eye out for the right altars to open!~|~translationMissing

) How are things at the Temple of the Eye?~|~translationMissing
I might do that, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Who else knows the teleport to the Rune Essence Mine?~|~translationMissing
Apart from myself, there's also Aubury in Varrock, Wizard Cromperty in East Ardougne, Brimstail in the Tree Gnome Stronghold and Wizard Distentor in Yanille's Wizards' Guild.~|~translationMissing
If the player spoke to the Mage of Zamorak about the Z.M.I. post-quest~|~translationMissing
Nothing thanks, I'm just looking around.~|~translationMissing
Well, take care. You stand on the ruins of the old destroyed Wizards' Tower. Strange and powerful magicks lurk here.~|~translationMissing

Archpriest of the Unicorn~|~translationMissing
Woo wooo?~|~translationMissing
Me? I am the Archpriest who was responsible for the running of this place! I am impressed that you managed to reach my resting place on the lowest level.~|~translationMissing
Well it wasn't easy for sure. You wouldn't believe how difficult it was to overcome some of those traps.~|~translationMissing
The intention was that they should've been impossible to pass. I should know. After all, it was I who was responsible for overseeing the safeguarding of this place.~|~translationMissing
Why did you need the safeguards? Surely they made it more difficult to do your work down here?~|~translationMissing
I'm not sure if I should say... I wouldn't want to compromise the trust that the Justiciar of the Unicorn has in me. Afterall, we did what we did for the safety of Hallowvale.~|~translationMissing
So... about that. Hallowvale no longer exists. The Hallowed Sepulchre is now beneath the vampyre capital of Darkmeyer within the lands of Morytania.~|~translationMissing
I see... So we lost then? In that case, I suppose it doesn't hurt to tell you after all.~|~translationMissing
One day the justiciar sent word to me that I should begin work on securing the Sepulchre. He feared an invasion from the followers of the Dark Lord.~|~translationMissing
Do you mean Zamorak?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I do. The justiciar said he was going to confront these forces but that I should stay to protect the secrets within this place. I wish I could have joined him on the battlefield. I carried out my duties though.~|~translationMissing
I never told the others what was really happening. Day by day we worked our way down to the final floor.~|~translationMissing
As we progressed further, we became more experienced at creating the traps. Each one was more deadly than the last.~|~translationMissing
Eventually, when our work was done, I performed the last rites for each of my followers and sealed them within the coffins on the final floor.~|~translationMissing
Finally, I did the same for myself. The knowledge of how to disarm the traps died with us.~|~translationMissing
You buried yourselves alive? That's... horrible!~|~translationMissing
No, I think at that point most of us were already dead. We died knowing that we sacrificed ourselves for the good of holy Saradomin and the justiciars who follow him.~|~translationMissing
Well, at the very least you succeeded at keeping the vampyres out of the Sepulchre. From what I have seen, none of them have been able to enter.~|~translationMissing
I am glad adventurer. Perhaps that information will allow my spirit to pass on peacefully soon.~|~translationMissing
Woo? Woo wooooooooo!~|~translationMissing
What are you doing in my coffin? Leave this holy place at once!~|~translationMissing
Arcis~|~translationMissing

Aredhel~|~translationMissing
Arena Guard Beni~|~translationMissing
Can I help you, [sir/madam]?~|~translationMissing
This is the Emir's Arena. Fighters come from far and wide to arrange fights against their friends and rivals. They can fight in 1v1 Tournaments or Duels.~|~translationMissing
The Arena is open only on PvP Arena worlds. Switch to one of those game worlds to play in the Arena.~|~translationMissing
Head over to the hospital north of the Arena, and speak to the Guides. They'll help you sign up to a fight. Now, can I help you with anything else?~|~translationMissing
The Emir of Al-Kharid has decreed that his Arena should be guarded, to stop ruffians like the Calamity Coven from returning. But is there something I can do for you?~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Calamity Coven.~|~translationMissing
The Calamity Coven were three brigands, followers of an ancient and derelict religion. Through their foul arts, they turned this Arena into a hotbed of corruption.~|~translationMissing
Maoma was a captain of the Emir's guard, but she abused her authority to rig fights so that the Coven would get rich at the people's expense.~|~translationMissing
Saika was the brains behind their operation, forging the Arena's accounts so that the Coven could keep all the profits, starving the Emir's public works of all funding.~|~translationMissing
Koriff used her charms to act as a gracious hostess, whipping up the crowds' excitement so that they'd gamble more and more unwisely, enriching the Coven.~|~translationMissing
Tell me again about the Calamity Coven.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any tips on how to win duels?~|~translationMissing
I'm fine, thanks.~|~translationMissing
The easiest way to win is to knock your opponent out in one blow!~|~translationMissing
But I can't hit that hard!~|~translationMissing
Don't stop believing.~|~translationMissing
Please stay within the Arena's boundaries.~|~translationMissing
On PvP Arena worlds, you can only use the PvP Arena. Switch to another world to play on your normal profile.~|~translationMissing

Can I try one?~|~translationMissing
No, fish your own.~|~translationMissing
Arena Guard Rachi~|~translationMissing
Could you give me some merching tips?~|~translationMissing
Buy high, sell low.~|~translationMissing
I... don't think that's right.~|~translationMissing
That's why I became a guard...~|~translationMissing
Arena Guard Yon~|~translationMissing
Could you come help me with something?~|~translationMissing
Could you come and help me with something?~|~translationMissing
If the problem isn't in the Arena, it's not my problem.~|~translationMissing
Why are all these souls here?~|~translationMissing
A corporeal body is a mere flesh-temple in which the soul dwells. As the body fails, the soul loses its home. Without guidance, it would drift into oblivion.~|~translationMissing
However, the Soul Altar provides a beacon, drawing the souls to this place where they may join the River.~|~translationMissing
The River leads the souls through unchartable realms, transcending the plane of the world as you see it, but the three-headed Guardian keeps them safe.~|~translationMissing
The souls are the dead of Kourend - ensure you respect the souls.~|~translationMissing
Why are you here?~|~translationMissing
I am here to salute the dead of Kourend whose souls are joining the River. Ensure you respect the souls.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has not yet found the Soul bearer~|~translationMissing
) I've been reading your book...~|~translationMissing
(If the player has started/completed the Bear Your Soul miniquest~|~translationMissing
) About the soul bearer again...~|~translationMissing
About the soul bearer again... I got it repaired by the Key Master. Thanks for your help.~|~translationMissing
Use it carefully, traveller, and respect the souls.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'm respecting the souls.~|~translationMissing

I am a librarian from the great library of Menaphos. I left to travel the desert and learn more of its history.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Enakhra.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Akthanakos.~|~translationMissing
Enakhra? I have read only a little about her. She was one of the Mahjarrat who arrived in Gielinor many thousands of years ago.~|~translationMissing
She supported Zamorak when he tried to gain power, and she apparently built a great temple in his honour somewhere in the desert.~|~translationMissing
However, it is said that when she showed it to him, he was not impressed, and told her that he would rather have a weapon that could slay gods.~|~translationMissing
That is the last anyone knows of what happened to her, and it took place several thousand years ago.~|~translationMissing
An interesting choice of topic. Akthanakos is a Mahjarrat who was apparently worshipped as a god for a while in these parts. That was a long time ago, of course.~|~translationMissing
Unlike many of his kin, he was against Zamorak's rise to power. Perhaps that's why he ended up out here. Zamorak has little sway in the desert.~|~translationMissing
Whatever his reasons, he clearly took a liking to living here. He took on the head of a camel and even made an amulet that would allow him to understand their kind.~|~translationMissing
Using it, he even trained some of the native camels to fight for him. Their name, 'Ugthanki', is derived from his.~|~translationMissing
Since he disappeared, however, it is said that the Ugthanki became more violent and started attacking travellers.~|~translationMissing
I'm good.~|~translationMissing
Good day, [sir/madam]. Are you interested in the history of this area?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I want to know more about the desert!~|~translationMissing
It's good to meet someone so eager to learn.~|~translationMissing
Now, what would you like to hear about?~|~translationMissing
Enakhra the Mahjarrat~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Enakhra the Mahjarrat.~|~translationMissing
I have read only a little about her. She was one of the Mahjarrat who arrived in Gielinor many thousands of years ago.~|~translationMissing
She supported Zamorak when he tried to gain power, but her attempts to gain his favour failed, and she retreated to a temple she had built.~|~translationMissing
Akthanakos the Mahjarrat~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Akthanakos the Mahjarrat.~|~translationMissing
Like Enakhra, his rival, Akthanakos came to Gielinor with the other Mahjarrat. He took on the aspect of one of the local gods, and is usually drawn with a camel's head.~|~translationMissing
He was against Zamorak's rise to power, but the last anyone knows of him was that he and Enakhra were thinking of forgetting their rivalry.~|~translationMissing
Enakhra's temple~|~translationMissing
Tell me about Enakhra's temple.~|~translationMissing
Well, my sources say that Enakhra tried to gain favour with Zamorak by building him a temple somewhere in the desert.~|~translationMissing
It is said that when she showed it to him, he was not impressed, and told her that he would rather have a weapon that could slay gods than a temple.~|~translationMissing
After that, it seems that Enakhra retreated to that temple. If she hasn't died, she's been there ever since.~|~translationMissing
The Camulet~|~translationMissing
Tell me about the Camulet.~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I've only heard rumours of it, but here's what I know.~|~translationMissing
When Akthanakos came to Gielinor and took on the aspect of a man with a camel's head, he made an amulet that would allow him to understand camels.~|~translationMissing
Why should I care about what happened thousands of years ago?~|~translationMissing
Because those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.~|~translationMissing
Knowing something about history can prevent you from making mistakes that people have made before, you see.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately, the plague in Sophanem prevents me from returning to the library.~|~translationMissing

Armour salesman~|~translationMissing
And to you. Can I help you?~|~translationMissing
I am a supplier of leather armours and accessories. Ask and I will tell you what I know.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about your armours.~|~translationMissing
I have normal, studded and hard types.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about normal leather.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, leather armour is excellent for archers. It's supple and not very heavy.~|~translationMissing
What's studded leather?~|~translationMissing
Ah, now that's leather covered with studs. It's more protective than ordinary leather.~|~translationMissing
What's hard leather?~|~translationMissing
Hard leather is specially treated using oils and drying methods to create a hard-wearing armour.~|~translationMissing
Enough about armour.~|~translationMissing
As you wish, traveller.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about your accessories.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes we have a new range of accessories in stock. Essential items for an archer like you.~|~translationMissing
We have vambraces, chaps, cowls and coifs.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about vambraces.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, vambraces. These useful items are for your arms.~|~translationMissing
A protective sheath that favours the bow and arrow. An essential purchase.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about chaps.~|~translationMissing
Chaps have two functions~|~translationMissing
firstly to protect your legs, and secondly for ease of reloading arrows.~|~translationMissing
I can highly recommend these to you for quick archery.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about cowls.~|~translationMissing
The cowl is a soft leather hat, ideal for protection with maneuverability.~|~translationMissing
These are highly favoured with our guards.~|~translationMissing
Tell me about coifs.~|~translationMissing
The coif is a specialized cowl, that has extra chain protection to keep your neck and shoulders safe.~|~translationMissing
An excellent addition to our range, traveller.~|~translationMissing
Enough about accessories.~|~translationMissing
I've seen enough, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Very good, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
I'd like to see what you sell.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, cast your eyes on my wares, adventurer.~|~translationMissing
(Aaron's Archery Appendages. interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
(If the player does not have 99 Ranged~|~translationMissing
) Can you tell me about your cape?~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me about your cape?~|~translationMissing
Certainly! Skillcapes are a symbol of achievement. Only people who have mastered a skill and reached level 99 can get their hands on them and gain the benefits they carry.~|~translationMissing
The Cape of Ranging has been modified by Ava to function as one of her accumulator devices. Is there anything else I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
(If the player has 99 Ranged~|~translationMissing
) Can I buy a Skillcape of Range?~|~translationMissing
Can I buy a Skillcape of Range?~|~translationMissing
Certainly! Right when you give me 99000 coins.~|~translationMissing

Arno~|~translationMissing
What's in this cave?~|~translationMissing
A unique farming patch. This cave is the only place we've succesfully[sic] been able to grow a Hespori.~|~translationMissing
What's a Hespori?~|~translationMissing
A rare carnivorous plant originally from Morytania. When grown, the plant becomes conscious and highly aggressive. They are truly fascinating.~|~translationMissing
Can I grow one?~|~translationMissing
Of course. Just plant some Hespori seeds in the cave below and it will grow like any other plant. A Hespori is pretty tough so you don't need to worry about it getting diseased.~|~translationMissing
Do be careful though. A fully grown Hespori can be quite troublesome to deal with.~|~translationMissing
If the player has no items in Arno's collection~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid not. If I did have any of your items, but you died before collecting them, they'll now be lost.~|~translationMissing
If the player has items in Arno's collection~|~translationMissing
I do indeed. You really should be more careful.~|~translationMissing
(Arno's Item Retrieval Service interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
(If the player can currently find Hespori seeds when farming~|~translationMissing
) I don't want to find Hespori seeds when farming.~|~translationMissing
I don't want to find Hespori seeds when farming.~|~translationMissing
Very well. You'll no longer find Hespori seeds when farming.~|~translationMissing
(If the player cannot currently find Hespori seeds when farming~|~translationMissing
) I want to find Hespori seeds when farming.~|~translationMissing
I want to find Hespori seeds when farming.~|~translationMissing
Very well. You'll now have a chance of finding Hespori seeds when farming.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have items in Arno's collection~|~translationMissing
I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. If I did have any of your items, but you died before collecting them, they'll now be lost.~|~translationMissing
If the player has items in Arno's Item Retrieval Service~|~translationMissing
Can you hear me down there? I have some of your items, from a previous visit. Shouldn't you collect them from me before fighting the Hespori again?~|~translationMissing
I'll come and collect them from you.~|~translationMissing
The player exits the cave.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't care if I lose that stuff.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't care if I lose that stuff. I'll fight the Hespori again now.~|~translationMissing
The player fights the Hespori.~|~translationMissing

Arthur the Clue Hunter~|~translationMissing
Ask about beginner clues.~|~translationMissing
What are beginner clues?~|~translationMissing
Arthur's eyes light up.~|~translationMissing
Beginner clues are the lowest tier of clue scroll and as such only require a couple of steps to solve.~|~translationMissing
Beginner clues are gained through various activities. Those activities are as follows.~|~translationMissing
Slaying monsters for a chance at a clue being dropped. I hear goblins are sneaky, maybe they have some clue scrolls on them ripe for the taking.~|~translationMissing
Maybe someone left one in the cow field, who knows where you could obtain them.~|~translationMissing
Beginner clues have also been known to be left in geodes while mining, as well as sometimes in bottles that you may fish up from time to time and from nests which fall out of trees.~|~translationMissing
Although this is a much rarer occurrence.~|~translationMissing
Unlike more advanced clues, you should not expect to get very valuable items from completing a beginner clue.~|~translationMissing
Ask about more advanced clues.~|~translationMissing
What are more advanced clues?~|~translationMissing
Advanced clues have tiers between easy and master.~|~translationMissing
You can gain advanced clues the same way you would get a beginner clue. But to get higher tier scrolls you will need to defeat more powerful foes.~|~translationMissing
The chance to get a higher tier clue from geodes, bottles and nests is lower the higher the tier. But if you chop down higher-level trees you will have a higher chance of receiving a nest which contains a clue. Same with fishing and mining.~|~translationMissing
The only exception to this is master clue scrolls.~|~translationMissing
Master clues can only be obtained as a rare chance when opening your casket or by handing in one of every type of clue, apart from beginner, to Watson who resides in Hosidius.~|~translationMissing
But with more advanced tiers of clue, come better loot.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the types of clues.~|~translationMissing
Anagrams.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue has you talk to someone around Gielinor. Although the clue does not tell you exactly who to talk to.~|~translationMissing
You will see a couple of words that may or may not make sense together. You will have to rearrange the letter to make the name of the person you need to talk to.~|~translationMissing
Challenge scrolls.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue has you work out a logical problem for the person you need to talk to. This type of challenge only appears in clue tiers medium, hard and elite.~|~translationMissing
There are also challenges that will involve you gathering an item or crafting an item for a certain person.~|~translationMissing
Cipher clues.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue has you talk to someone around Gielinor. Although the clue does not tell you exactly who to talk to. This type of challenge only appears in clue tiers medium, hard and elite.~|~translationMissing
A cipher is a string of letters that have been scrambled using the shift cipher method.~|~translationMissing
An example of this would be ZCZL which, shifted forward by one, would be Adam.~|~translationMissing
Coordinate clues.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue will have you use a sextant, chart and a watch to find out the place you will need to dig. This type of challenge only appears in clue tiers medium and above.~|~translationMissing
After you find the place you need to dig, you may find a casket or another scroll.~|~translationMissing
Cryptic clues.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue can be as simple as talk to the specified person or searching a crate in a specified location.~|~translationMissing
But the higher the tier of clue, the more steps you will have to do beforehand. An example of this would be needing to find a key before opening a chest.~|~translationMissing
Emote clues.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue will give you a location that you will need to visit, along with some items you will need.~|~translationMissing
At this location you will need to perform an emote, as well as wear the items that you had to bring along.~|~translationMissing
Some clues may have you wear nothing at all.~|~translationMissing
But please don't do that in public!~|~translationMissing
This type of challenge only appears in clue tiers medium and above.~|~translationMissing
Hot Cold clues.~|~translationMissing
Depending on the tier of clue, you will need to obtain a strange device from either Reldo, located in Varrock, or Jorral, located south of Tree Gnome Stronghold.~|~translationMissing
You will then need to use this device to find the location you will need to dig.~|~translationMissing
Puzzle clues.~|~translationMissing
There are many different puzzles that you can come across while doing clues. These range from light boxes to puzzle boxes.~|~translationMissing
Puzzle boxes are puzzles that will have you complete a slider puzzle that, when complete, will look like an image in game.~|~translationMissing
Light boxes are a puzzle which contains a 5 by 5 grid of lights with some lights on and some lights off.~|~translationMissing
The puzzle will have you click the buttons below to turn on or off some of the lights with the end goal being, having all the lights turned on.~|~translationMissing
Map clues.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue will show you a map of an area.~|~translationMissing
This map will show you where you will need to dig, or what you will need to search to get the next clue.~|~translationMissing
Fairy ring clues.~|~translationMissing
This type of clue will show you which fairy ring code you will need to use to get to the right place to dig.~|~translationMissing
You will then need to use the numbers to figure our where you will need to dig after arriving to your destination.~|~translationMissing
Toggle gaining vesseled clue scrolls.~|~translationMissing
If vesseled clue scrolls are currently toggled on~|~translationMissing
Hey Arthur, can I stop receiving clues from vessels? They're clogging up my backpack!~|~translationMissing
Vessel containers include mining geodes, fishing bottles and clue nests. Are you sure you want to stop receiving them?~|~translationMissing
Yes please, I want to stop receiving vesseled containers.~|~translationMissing
Very well, you'll no longer find clues from mining, fishing and woodcutting.~|~translationMissing
If vesseled clue scrolls are currently toggled off~|~translationMissing
Hey Arthur, can I start receiving clues from vessels?~|~translationMissing
Vessel containers include mining geodes, fishing bottles and clue nests. Are you sure you want to start receiving them, again?~|~translationMissing
Yes please, I want to start receiving vesseled containers~|~translationMissing
Yes please, I want to start receiving vesseled containers.~|~translationMissing
Very well, you'll now find clues from mining, fishing and woodcutting.~|~translationMissing
So long and happy clue hunting!~|~translationMissing
I've got it!~|~translationMissing
I'm going to be rich!~|~translationMissing
Hmm.... What could this mean?~|~translationMissing
Why is this so hard...~|~translationMissing
Why did I not think of that before.~|~translationMissing
Artimeus~|~translationMissing
What kinds of items do you stock?~|~translationMissing
Take a look for yourself.~|~translationMissing
(Nardah Hunter Shop. interface opens)~|~translationMissing
I'm not in the market for Hunter equipment right now, thanks.~|~translationMissing
Maybe another time, then.~|~translationMissing
Why is the Accord important?~|~translationMissing
The signing of the Accord marked the start of a golden age. Once the Royal Lords replaced the Council of Elders, Kourend prospered like never before.~|~translationMissing
What makes you say the council have done a bad job?~|~translationMissing
Fair enough. See you later.~|~translationMissing
Hello there Artur. Actually... I guess I should say Your Majesty now.~|~translationMissing
King Artur Hosidius~|~translationMissing
For you friend, Artur is fine.~|~translationMissing
You should not dispense formalities Artur. A king should command respect.~|~translationMissing
I can command respect without using fancy titles, mother.~|~translationMissing
So, how are you doing.~|~translationMissing
I have a lot of responsibility now. There's much to learn and not much time to learn it in. The loss of father still weighs heavily on me as well.~|~translationMissing
Still, I am well supported by those around me. I'm sure that with their help, I can be the ruler the people deserve.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure you can as well. Anyway, I'll let you get on with you work.~|~translationMissing
Until next time~|~translationMissing
Arvel~|~translationMissing
Good day traveller. You are far from home, what brings you here?~|~translationMissing
I am a wandering [hero/heroine], I come here in search of adventure.~|~translationMissing
Sounds ghastly, I just want to live in peace.~|~translationMissing
Unfortunately without people like me, peace doesn't last for long.~|~translationMissing
True, but then again most adventurers cause as much trouble as they put right.~|~translationMissing
You've got a point there... Hmm...~|~translationMissing
Well, good day traveller. And always do the right thing.~|~translationMissing
Good day traveller.~|~translationMissing
Hi there, how's it going?~|~translationMissing
Well we're still alive, after all that's happened, we should be thankful of that.~|~translationMissing
Hopefully this war is over soon.~|~translationMissing
Indeed, but how many more need to die before that happens?~|~translationMissing
He seems to be lost in his own thoughts...~|~translationMissing
Hello again. You find any signs of that treasure yet?~|~translationMissing
Well... not as such, but I unleashed a powerful demon from its tomb in return for unbelievable magical power.~|~translationMissing
So... no gold then?~|~translationMissing
Not as such, no. Sorry about that.~|~translationMissing
Aw... I was hoping to go abroad on holiday this year.~|~translationMissing
Maybe I'll go check out Karamja next, I hear there's treasure to be found there...~|~translationMissing
Tell me of your adventures~|~translationMissing
As you are a big famous archaeologist, maybe you could spare the time to tell me a couple of tales of your exploits?~|~translationMissing
Hey, sure thing kid! Well, this one time I found this spooky old temple in the middle of the jungle.~|~translationMissing
The entrance was hidden from sight by all these vines and stuff, and it was full of zombies and crazy tribesmen and stuff.~|~translationMissing
That wasn't the worst thing though! There were all these crazy traps that were hidden around the place too!~|~translationMissing
Well anyway, I found the secret entrance, fought my way in through the zombies and tribesmen, and came to a big pedestal with a statue of solid gold sat on top of it!~|~translationMissing
Solid gold, huh? Wow.~|~translationMissing
That's right! It was a cunning trap though! As soon as I picked up the statue, a trapdoor opened up underneath me, and I fell into a darkened room, full of~|~translationMissing
bones, and the biggest meanest tribesman you ever did see!~|~translationMissing
Huge he was, and real ugly looking! He had this huge sword too, and he came running towards me screaming something in some language I didn't understand!~|~translationMissing
What did you do?~|~translationMissing
Well, while he was screaming at me, and swinging his sword around in front of me, trying to intimidate me before attacking, I cooly and calmly...~|~translationMissing
All the while, knowing that if I died in this spot nobody would even know where I was...~|~translationMissing
I knew, if this tribesman killed me, that would be the end of Asgarnia Smith, and all of his treasure hunting...~|~translationMissing
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?!?!~|~translationMissing
Well, while he was screaming and waving his sword around, I stood behind a nearby stalactite, then shot him with my shortbow.~|~translationMissing
And that was how I recovered the Golden Monkey of Tee-Ta-Toh.~|~translationMissing
Tell me how you became an Archaeologist~|~translationMissing
So... How exactly did you get into this line of work anyway?~|~translationMissing
It seems an odd choice of career for a man like yourself.~|~translationMissing
Thinking of joining your pal Asgarnia in the wonderful world of treasure hun- um, archaeology, huh?~|~translationMissing
Well, it all started the day I was fishing in catherby[sic], funnily enough.~|~translationMissing
Ah yes, I remember it well... I was just sat there, hoping to catch a bass or two, when I made the most amazing discovery!~|~translationMissing
In my fishing nets, I had found an ancient casket, marred and worn by centuries underwater!~|~translationMissing
With trembling hands, I slowly and cautiously opened it, wondering what ancient secret may have been kept inside...~|~translationMissing
What valuable heirloom may have been dredged up by my nets that had not decayed underwater long ago...~|~translationMissing
And you know what I found inside?~|~translationMissing
No, what?~|~translationMissing
I found 320 coins! Just like that! Just by fishing I had found 320 coins! 320 coins! Can you believe it?~|~translationMissing
Um... Yes, yes I can.~|~translationMissing
Well, it might not seem much to us now kid, but back then, it was a revelation!~|~translationMissing
Why waste my time fishing when there were secret treasures from long ago hidden around the world?~|~translationMissing
I immediately applied to the Museum of Varrock as a field agent, and the rest is history!~|~translationMissing
Hey, thanks kid. Looking snazzy is an important part of being a treasure hunter!~|~translationMissing
See you later...~|~translationMissing
Well, I'll see you again sometime maybe. Sorry I couldn't get you any treasure...~|~translationMissing
Ah, don't sweat it kid. I'll be honest with ya - I'm already rich many times over, and its more the kicks of being a treasure hunter I do it for than the actual cash!~|~translationMissing

Hello? Who are you? What is this place?~|~translationMissing
Ashuelot Reis~|~translationMissing
I'm... Ashuelot... Ashuelot Reis. But I don't understand... How are you here?~|~translationMissing
Oh... Well I'm [player name], and I'm here because I was told there was a great treasure to be found.~|~translationMissing
Treasure? I fear you have been misled. There is no treasure here, only our great mistake.~|~translationMissing
Mistake?~|~translationMissing
This place is a prison. Here, a being of incomprehensible power was sealed away. Things would have stayed that way, if not for our foolishness.~|~translationMissing
We thought we were doing good, but we were led astray. We opened the prison, and unleashed the horror within.~|~translationMissing
But the door was locked until I came along.~|~translationMissing
Yes... After our great mistake, four opposing armies united to contain the evil again. They managed to reseal the prison, but they were unable to repair the original enchantments.~|~translationMissing
This place has remained vulnerable ever since.~|~translationMissing
And now I've opened it again.~|~translationMissing
If what you've told me is true, you were fooled just as we were. But I suppose that means little now. With the prison now open again, there isn't much to prevent the evil escaping once more.~|~translationMissing
There must be something I can do to stop it.~|~translationMissing
There is only one thing you can do. You can fight.~|~translationMissing
Then that is what I will do.~|~translationMissing
Though, now that I think about it, I'm still not overly clear what this evil is.~|~translationMissing
She is a being of darkness. A servant of the Ruinous Powers. She is the Angel of Death. She is Nex.~|~translationMissing
I'll stop her.~|~translationMissing
I hope so. Nex can be found in the inner section of the prison. Join me there. But be warned, Nex was not imprisoned alone. You'll need to fight through her followers to reach her.~|~translationMissing
Ashuelot Reis departs for the inner section of the prison.~|~translationMissing
You made it?~|~translationMissing
You didn't think I would?~|~translationMissing
Nex's followers are capable of bringing down even the strongest of warriors. I did fear you might not make it past them.~|~translationMissing
Still, they are nothing compared to the Angel of Death herself.~|~translationMissing
So how do I deal with her?~|~translationMissing
You will never be able to truly defeat her. The best you can do is to try and keep her contained. When you are ready to face her, just go through the barrier.~|~translationMissing
If it helps, while my magic is limited here, I should still be able to transfer items in and out of the prison for you. Let me know if you'd like me to do this before you enter.~|~translationMissing
Tell me more about Nex.~|~translationMissing
Long ago, these lands were dominated by a great empire, ruled over by an ancient god. The Empty Lord is what they often called him, but his true name was Zaros.~|~translationMissing
Zaros? I've heard of him.~|~translationMissing
At the height of his power, Zaros seemed untouchable, but he was eventually defeated by those he trusted the most. With him gone, the empire collapsed. War broke out soon after.~|~translationMissing
Although their god was gone, many Zarosians fought to keep his empire alive. Among them was Nex. She was Zaros' most powerful weapon, and she led a great army to try and restore his empire.~|~translationMissing
Not that she needed an army of course. Nex alone was powerful enough to hold back hundreds of lesser beings.~|~translationMissing
So how did she end up here?~|~translationMissing
The forces of Saradomin knew that Nex needed to be dealt with. They were able to lure her into these caverns.~|~translationMissing
After great effort and sacrifice, they managed to place Nex and her followers into a frozen, enchanted sleep.~|~translationMissing
Once Nex was no longer an immediate threat, they built the Temple of Lost Ancients around her. Most of the temple has since fallen to ruin, but you can still see some of the remains.~|~translationMissing
But she wasn't frozen forever, was she? You said you were fooled into freeing her.~|~translationMissing
Yes. Later in the war, a great battle broke out in the Temple of Lost Ancients. I was a Saradominist soldier at the time, and I was among those who fought for him in that battle.~|~translationMissing
By then, many of us had grown tired of war. One of our priests discovered this. He came to us and revealed that he felt the same way, and that he had secretly converted to Guthix. He encouraged us to join him.~|~translationMissing
We abandoned the cause of Saradomin and became followers of Guthix. Our new leader taught us the ways of the druids, including an ancient ritual that had the power to awaken Guthix himself.~|~translationMissing
We believed this ritual to be the only way to end the war.~|~translationMissing
But I'm guessing that's not how things went?~|~translationMissing
No... When our leader led us to perform the ritual, it was not Guthix we woke, but Nex and her forces. The ritual also destroyed the protective enchantments on their prison.~|~translationMissing
And that was exactly what your leader wanted?~|~translationMissing
It was. He had never been a follower of Guthix, or Saradomin. His real goal had always been to free Nex.~|~translationMissing
The rest is as I already told you. Nex posed such a danger, that the four armies temorarily joined forces to drive her back into the prison. They resealed it, but were unable to fix the enchantments we destroyed.~|~translationMissing
As for me, I was one of the first to fall after Nex was freed, but I didn't truly die. Something about our ritual tied me to this place. I've been trapped here ever since. Not dead, but not really alive either.~|~translationMissing
Don't be. This is the punishment for my sins.~|~translationMissing
What of the one that led the ritual. What came of him?~|~translationMissing
He'd achieved his goal, so he left. I never saw him again.~|~translationMissing
But who was he really?~|~translationMissing
He never gave us his true name, but as Nex was freed, she spoke to him.~|~translationMissing
She knew him?~|~translationMissing
It seemed that way. I heard little of what they said, but I did hear what she called him.~|~translationMissing
Sliske.~|~translationMissing
Forgive me, but this conversation has brought back many memories. Let us speak no more of this.~|~translationMissing
Can I access my bank?~|~translationMissing
bank interface opens~|~translationMissing
I'd like to collect some items.~|~translationMissing

Hey there, buddy. You're an outerlander, huh? I'm not really supposed to talk to you.~|~translationMissing
I dunno buddy. Some stupid tradition or other. We're always told not to talk to outerlanders unless the Chieftain has allowed it.~|~translationMissing
The Chieftain? Who is that?~|~translationMissing
His names Brundt, buddy. He's a real boring guy. You can find him in the longhall there.~|~translationMissing
Can you take me to see him?~|~translationMissing
Sorry buddy, I'm not allowed into the Longhall. Don't worry, he's easy to spot. He's the one in the fancy helmet. Oh, and he only has one eye.~|~translationMissing

Nah, nah, nah... He just wears an eyepatch! Well, see ya around buddy!~|~translationMissing
Hey there, buddy. You're an outerlander, huh?~|~translationMissing

If the player only has Kegs of Beer in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Wanna sell me ya kegs of beer for 500 gold coins each outerlander?~|~translationMissing
I don't know... Seems a little off to sell alcohol to a child...~|~translationMissing
Hey, don't judge our customs outerlander! Now you want the cash or you want to bug me?~|~translationMissing
Would you like to sell your kegs of beer?~|~translationMissing

You wanna sell me the lot buddy, or one at a time?~|~translationMissing

Okay buddy, suit yerself!~|~translationMissing
Hi. Are you a member of the council of elders?~|~translationMissing
Me? On the council? Ha ha ha ha! Sorry buddy, I'm not a 'real' Fremennik yet! Let me guess, you're trying to get some council members to vote for you?~|~translationMissing
That's right, to become a Fremennik.~|~translationMissing
You and me both buddy! We're both doing the same trials! This is my trial of manhood! How you finding it so far? Pretty easy, huh buddy?~|~translationMissing
It's okay I guess...~|~translationMissing
Yeah, that's the spirit buddy! It's all real easy, I wouldn't worry yourself about it, you'll be quaffing beers in the longhall as a Fremennik in no time!~|~translationMissing
Hello there. I understand you managed to get some golden wool from Lalli?~|~translationMissing
HAHAHA! Yeah, that Lalli... what a maroon!~|~translationMissing
So how did you manage to get the wool?~|~translationMissing
Well, as you know, I am doing the same trials that you are as part of my test of manhood, and that troll is the only one who can get that wool.~|~translationMissing
You might have noticed he's kind of... messed in the head buddy! He's real paranoid about people stealing his golden apples, isn't he?~|~translationMissing
Indeed he is. So how did you manage to get some golden wool from him?~|~translationMissing
It was easy buddy! I persuaded him he needed a pet to help him guard his apples. A pet that would never sleep! A pet that would never need food, or exercise!~|~translationMissing
A pet that would never need him to clean up its... well, you know, buddy. A pet that would always be loyal to him! A faithful companion for life!~|~translationMissing
What pet is this then?~|~translationMissing
A pet ROCK!~|~translationMissing
Man, can you believe that stupid troll traded me some of his golden wool for a worthless ROCK?~|~translationMissing
Do you have any spare rocks then?~|~translationMissing
Sure thing buddy, although I have to say, I doubt even that troll is stupid enough to fall for the SAME trick TWICE in a row! You can try anyway though!~|~translationMissing
(the player is handed a pet rock. Claim Pet Rock option is added to Askeladden.)~|~translationMissing
So this is the exact same type of rock you managed to sell to Lalli as a pet?~|~translationMissing
Yup, sure is buddy! That Lalli is stupid, even by troll standards!~|~translationMissing
Can I have another rock? I lost mine...~|~translationMissing
Sure thing buddy! I'd say take better care of this one, but it's just a rock! I have hundreds of them! Go wild!~|~translationMissing
(the player receives pet rock)~|~translationMissing
Sure thing, but you'd better free up some space first.~|~translationMissing
Can I have another pet rock?~|~translationMissing
Sure, have as many as you like. I've plenty more!~|~translationMissing
Your inventory is too full to accept another 'pet rock'.~|~translationMissing
Ask about the Merchant's trial~|~translationMissing
I don't suppose you have any idea where I could find a written promise from Askeladden to stay out of the Longhall?~|~translationMissing
What? I can't believe she asked you to get a written promise from me to stay out!~|~translationMissing
Yup, she really did.~|~translationMissing
Awwwwwww.... but the longhall is just SO MUCH FUN! I'd live there if I could! I suppose you really need that promise to help become a Fremennik, huh?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, I really do...~|~translationMissing
That's all you want in return? Sure thing. Here you go.~|~translationMissing
Done, and done. Let me know if you got any more cash burning a hole in your pocket I can relieve you of, buddy.~|~translationMissing
(player receives Promissory note)~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have 5000 coins~|~translationMissing
...how embarrassing. I appear to be short...~|~translationMissing
Trying to scam me, huh buddy? Well it won't work! You come back with the cash, or don't come back at all!~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have space in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Your inventory is too full to accept the written promise.~|~translationMissing
I don't think so... That's really quite a lot of money...~|~translationMissing
Hey, suit yourself buddy. You change your mind, the bank of Askeladden is open for deposits 24 hours a day! Eh-heh-heh-heh-heh.~|~translationMissing
Ask about becoming a Fremennik~|~translationMissing
I thought you really liked the long hall?~|~translationMissing
I do!~|~translationMissing
Then why did you sign this guarantee that you will never enter it again?~|~translationMissing
Aha! It is because I am cunning! That guarantee says that Askeladden will never enter the longhall again! But when I have completed my Fremennik trials,~|~translationMissing
and passed my trial of manhood, I will be given a new name, as is our custom, and will therefore not be Askeladden anymore! That guarantee isn't worth the paper it's written on!!~|~translationMissing
You didn't think I would give up going to the longhall for only 5000 did you?~|~translationMissing
Knowing you, I guess I didn't.~|~translationMissing
Hello again Askeladden.~|~translationMissing
Hey buddy! That ain't my name no more! My new Fremennik name is Larravak! What's yours?~|~translationMissing
My Fremennik name is [Fremennik name].~|~translationMissing
Ha! Ain't as good as my name buddy! So what can I do ya for?~|~translationMissing
Ask about things to do~|~translationMissing
I guess you could do a bit of shopping. We got fresh fish at the docks, and some armour and weapons at Skulgrimen's place.~|~translationMissing
Ask for a new pet rock~|~translationMissing

If the player has inventory space but doesn't have a pet rock in their inventory, bank, or player-owned house~|~translationMissing

Hi buddy! Or do ya want me to call ya [Fremennik name] now?~|~translationMissing
Ask what Askeladden is doing here~|~translationMissing
Askeladden, what on Gielinor are you doing up here? And by the way, the name is [player name].~|~translationMissing
Sure thing, buddy!~|~translationMissing
I was down in that cave killing dagger-mouths! It was fun! But then I got thirsty, so came up here for a bit of a rest...~|~translationMissing
Hey buddy, I'll tell you what, if you got any kegs of beer on ya, I'll buy them off ya for 700 gold coins each!~|~translationMissing
If ya found any animal parts killing dagger-mouths I'll trade ya for them too!~|~translationMissing
Wanna sell me kegs of beer for 700 gold coins each buddy?~|~translationMissing
Um... Aren't you a little... ...young to be drinking so much?~|~translationMissing
Hey, don't talk to me like that buddy! I've done all the trials you have and I'm just as mucha  Fremennik as you are!~|~translationMissing
Now are ya gonna sell me some beer, or are you going to cry about it all day?~|~translationMissing
The player sells all of their Kegs of Beer for 700 coins each.~|~translationMissing

Hello Asteros. What brings you to the castle?~|~translationMissing
The King's late father asked for an advisor from Arceuus. He was keen for us to have a more central role than we did under the Council.~|~translationMissing
I see. I'm sure the King is glad to have you here.~|~translationMissing
He does seem willing to take on my advice, which is very welcoming. I hope he remains humble. It is a trait many leaders lack.~|~translationMissing
Now, is there something else I can do for you? If you're interested, I can offer you the ability to respawn at Kourend Castle upon death.~|~translationMissing
Very well. From now on, you will respawn at Kourend Castle.~|~translationMissing
Let me know if you change your mind.~|~translationMissing

(Fancy Clothes Store interface opens)~|~translationMissing
Could you make another bird costume for me?~|~translationMissing
Could you make another eagle costume for me?~|~translationMissing
Certainly, if you can supply the materials. I'll need appropriate feathers, swamp tar and some yellow dye. It'll also cost you 25 gold pieces.~|~translationMissing
I think I might just leave the perusing for now thanks.~|~translationMissing

(Custom Fur Clothing interface opens)~|~translationMissing
What sort of unusual materials did you have in mind?~|~translationMissing
Well, some more colourful feathers might be useful. For some surreal reason, all I normally seem to get offered are large quantities of rather beaten-up looking chicken feathers.~|~translationMissing
People must have some very strange pastimes around these parts, that's all I can say.~|~translationMissing

I have been sent here with a package for you.~|~translationMissing
I have been sent here with a package for you. It's from the head wizard at the Wizards' Tower.~|~translationMissing
Really? But... surely he can't have..? Please, let me have it, it must be extremely important for him to have sent a stranger.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the research package~|~translationMissing
You hand Aubury the research package.~|~translationMissing
This... this is incredible. Please, give me a few moments to quickly look over this, and then talk to me again.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have the research package~|~translationMissing
What kind of person tells me they have a delivery for me, but not with them? Honestly.~|~translationMissing
Come back when you do.~|~translationMissing
My gratitude to you adventurer for bringing me these research notes. I notice that you brought the head wizard a special talisman that was the key to our finally unlocking the puzzle.~|~translationMissing
Combined with the information I had already collated regarding the Rune Essence, I think we have finally unlocked the power to~|~translationMissing
...no. I am getting ahead of myself. Please take this summary of my research back to the head wizard at the Wizards' Tower. I trust his judgement on whether to let you in on our little secret or not.~|~translationMissing
(Player receives Notes (Rune Mysteries).)~|~translationMissing
Aubury gives you his research notes.~|~translationMissing
I suggest you take those research notes of mine back to the head wizard at the Wizards' Tower.~|~translationMissing
If the player has the research notes~|~translationMissing
Ok then, I will do that.~|~translationMissing
Unless you were talking to me because you wished to buy some runes?~|~translationMissing
If the player lost the research notes~|~translationMissing
I can't... I lost them...~|~translationMissing
Well, luckily I have duplicates. It's a good thing they are written in code, I would not want the wrong kind of person to get access to the information contained within.~|~translationMissing
Actually, I'm here with a business proposal from Ali Morrisane.~|~translationMissing
Ali who?~|~translationMissing
Ali Morrisane, a salesman of great repute based in Al Kharid.~|~translationMissing
What is this proposal then?~|~translationMissing
He wants to set up a rune-selling franchise in the markets of Al Kharid and he wants you to supply him with the stock.~|~translationMissing
Why doesn't he get his own runes and sell them?~|~translationMissing
His talents don't lie in that area. What he's good at is selling things, and lots of them.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, interesting... So let's get this straight, he wants me to supply him with runes, which he will sell, and send me the profits?~|~translationMissing
Nearly. He will charge a small commission on the runes.~|~translationMissing
Do you think that it will work? Will people actually buy these runes off him?~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't be surprised. Supply and demand are his rune essence and ore.~|~translationMissing
Now this is very important, is he trustworthy?~|~translationMissing
Yes, I believe so. Trust is a key part of commerce and something, which I doubt he would neglect.~|~translationMissing
Fair enough, I'll trust your judgement.~|~translationMissing
So you'll supply him with runes then?~|~translationMissing
Well if he's half as good a salesman as you suggest I should have no problem in funding my research and maybe even redecorating this place.~|~translationMissing
Oh, sorry [player name], I didn't recognise you for a second, you're back again so soon. Have you spoken to Ali Morrisane yet about the runes?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not talked to Ali Morrisane yet~|~translationMissing
Umm... not yet, I'll try to get around to doing that soon.~|~translationMissing
If the player has talked to Ali Morrisane~|~translationMissing
Ya... about that, there's some crazy locking mechanism attached to each casket of runes, which he cannot figure out.~|~translationMissing
Oh, yes, the rune locks, they're a bit of a doozy, I've completely forgotten how they work, but I'm sure they shouldn't prove too much of a struggle to an intelligent adventurerer[sic] like you, [player name]. Eh?~|~translationMissing
I wouldn't hold my breath.~|~translationMissing
Great! Now, do want to buy some runes?~|~translationMissing
Auctioneer~|~translationMissing
Gather round, one and all! It's time for the Darkmeyer Auctions!~|~translationMissing
We've got quite the lineup for you today! So, let's get started!~|~translationMissing

Anyone for 4,000?~|~translationMissing
3,000 going once!~|~translationMissing
3,000 going twice!~|~translationMissing
Sold to the vyre at the back!~|~translationMissing

We'll start with 5,000 for this one! Do I have any takers!~|~translationMissing
Right here!~|~translationMissing
5,000 coins for the lady at the front! How about 6,000?~|~translationMissing
I have 6,000! Who wants 7,000!~|~translationMissing
I'll take her for 10,000!~|~translationMissing

Sold for 12,000 coins! Enjoy!~|~translationMissing
Okay, finally we have a 41 year old male from sector three!~|~translationMissing

If you can put him in his place though, you're in for a treat! His blood is the sweetest around!~|~translationMissing
We'll begin with 4,000 coins!~|~translationMissing

Audmann~|~translationMissing
Oh, don't bother me human.~|~translationMissing
Why not? What's wrong?~|~translationMissing
You are wrong, human. Your attire is outrageous. Your presence is obnoxious.~|~translationMissing
What? What are you saying?~|~translationMissing
I'm saying you're in my way.~|~translationMissing

You still seem to have your cap.~|~translationMissing
If the bomber cap has been lost but there is no free inventory space~|~translationMissing
You don't have enough free space for your cap.~|~translationMissing

Here's your cap. Try to keep better track of it.~|~translationMissing

(If the player has a bomber cap and gnome goggles) Could you combine my cap and goggles?~|~translationMissing
There you go! You look like a true airship pilot now.~|~translationMissing
If the player is wearing them~|~translationMissing
I can't combine them if you are wearing them.~|~translationMissing
If the player doesn't have space for the cap and goggles~|~translationMissing

Hey it's the Hero! Wow! You're amazing, how on earth did you manage to tackle those two juvinates and Gadderanks? And the town is lovely, you've done a great job!~|~translationMissing
You're more than welcome.~|~translationMissing
I'm Aurel the village store owner.~|~translationMissing
Can you open the shop for me please?~|~translationMissing
(Aurel's Supplies interface opens)~|~translationMissing
How do you like your town?~|~translationMissing
It's just perfect, thanks so much for your efforts.~|~translationMissing
What's happening around here?~|~translationMissing
Oh, not much really, we're all still hiding from the vampyres and eking out a living from this terrible place, hopefully soon we'll be strong enough to make the journey to the temple on the Salve.~|~translationMissing
Is there anything I can do to help out?~|~translationMissing
Not as far as I know, we have some basic amenities now which is so very useful, we're all incredibly grateful to you. I've never really seen or known a hero before, so I have nothing to compare one to, but I suspect in~|~translationMissing
most people's judgement, you would be one! I for one am very pleased to have met you.~|~translationMissing
I've lost Gadderanks' Warhammer.~|~translationMissing
Hmm, how careless of you! However, you're in luck! Someone found it earlier and sold it to me.~|~translationMissing
Now I can pass the hammer back to you for the remarkably cheap price of 3000 gold coins. Deal?~|~translationMissing
If the player is not carrying enough coins~|~translationMissing
But I don't have 3000 coins on me?~|~translationMissing
So that means you can't have it then! Come back when you have 3000 coins.~|~translationMissing
If the player is carrying enough coins~|~translationMissing
Okay, I'll pay 3000 coins for the hammer.~|~translationMissing
Oayk[sic], I'll pay 3000 coins for the hammer.~|~translationMissing
A good deal and I'm sure of it!~|~translationMissing
Player receives the Gadderhammer~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'll leave it. 3000 coins is too much to pay.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'll leave it, 3000 coins is too much to pay.~|~translationMissing
Very good then! I'll have no guilty conscience in offering it to other adventurers that frequent my shop then. Many thanks for your time and good day to ya sir.~|~translationMissing
Why does the hammer cost so much?~|~translationMissing
So much! That's cheap! The adventurer I bought it from wanted twice as much but I managed to knock him down to a reasonable price.~|~translationMissing
If the player is on a Quest Speedrunning world~|~translationMissing
I'd rather not, thank you.~|~translationMissing
This quest is not available on Speedrunning Worlds.~|~translationMissing

Devices, please.~|~translationMissing
(Ava's Devices interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
I'd like information, please.~|~translationMissing
Just a few bits of information before you run away to persecute rock crabs or cows.~|~translationMissing
Firstly, your new device won't work if you are wearing certain metallic chest armours.~|~translationMissing
The magnetic attraction required for operation would cause feedback, so the device does not allow such incompatible item equip page.~|~translationMissing
Secondly, although the device is calibrated to attract only arrow heads, there is a chance that other magnetically active items will be attracted.~|~translationMissing
The arrow recovery function of the devices is slightly different and relies upon a harmonic bond between your arrows and the chicken's magnet. You'll thus only recover arrows which you have fired rather than those~|~translationMissing
fired by nearby folks.~|~translationMissing
You'll also need to move about if you want to collect arrows since the gathering of long-lost arrowheads can't work otherwise.~|~translationMissing
Finally, the device will only work when worn. It automatically deactivates in other circumstances.~|~translationMissing
I was worried about what would happen if you were to place it in a bank in its active state, so I've made sure it only works when it's on your back.~|~translationMissing
Can I have more locator orbs, please?~|~translationMissing
(Locator orb request interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
(Player receives [amount] orbs.)~|~translationMissing
Ava gives you [another orb/[amount] orbs].~|~translationMissing

You show the banana to King Awowogei.~|~translationMissing
Now that's quite the banana. Where did you get it?~|~translationMissing
Far from here, deep in the Kharidian Desert.~|~translationMissing
Interesting... Continue.~|~translationMissing
You recount your experiences with the baboons in Osmumten's Tomb...~|~translationMissing
Well, that was a fascinating story. We have of course heard of various troops of our kind spread across the land, but this is the first I have heard of these ones.~|~translationMissing
Now that we know their story, you can rest assured that their memory will live on here.~|~translationMissing

If the player has completed Monkey Madness II~|~translationMissing
Once again you have proven a friend to our kind, human. I appreciate that none of my followers were harmed.~|~translationMissing
It was definitely more work than I thought it would be.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'd imagine so. Our kind are much more nimble than yours. I still don't know why you insist on using only two of your four legs.~|~translationMissing

If the player has not completed the Lunar Diplomacy quest~|~translationMissing
Ah, a stranger to our island. How can I help?~|~translationMissing
If the player has completed the Lunar Diplomacy quest~|~translationMissing
(If the player has finished Lunar Diplomacy but not unlocked the Ourania Teleport~|~translationMissing
) There is a lunar spell I can't use in my spell book - can you help me?~|~translationMissing
There's a lunar spell in my spell book that I can't use. Could you...?~|~translationMissing
Help you? Certainly. It's one I've just rediscovered! I can teach it to you if you like, but you have to listen to a story first.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I don't mind hearing stories.~|~translationMissing
Okay, I don't mind hearing sto-~|~translationMissing
Well, I was going through some ancient documents recently, expanding my knowledge of our great ancestors...~|~translationMissing
Hmm, actually, I think I had better go further back, so you will understand.~|~translationMissing
You know of our ancient war with the Fremennik that you recently healed?~|~translationMissing
Of course! I am a great diplomat, aren't I?~|~translationMissing
Some diplomat. Did you even discover WHY we were at war for so long?~|~translationMissing
Errr... You couldn't see eye to eye about magic, or something like that.~|~translationMissing
The Fremennik were actually the first to discover how to make runes, but there was disagreement within the tribe about the implications of making such powerful objects.~|~translationMissing
Most Fremennik felt we were stealing power from the gods. They could not see past that to the great things we could do with such power, so we split from them and became the Moon Clan. Our ancient leader, who first~|~translationMissing
discovered the rune essence mine here on Lunar Isle, travelled far and wide searching for more places of power. He and his followers built altars all over Gielinor - which you use today to create runes - and at their~|~translationMissing
height they made runes by the crateful. They had perfected the process and even advanced it, creating altars that could create any type of rune regardless of the crafter's ability. But the strife between the Moon~|~translationMissing
Clan and the Fremennik heightened. The Fremennik had grown strong in body, while our clan had grown stong in mind. They overpowered our tribe and we retreated to Lunar Isle, where we had lived ever since.~|~translationMissing
The Fremennik then swept over Gielinor destroying the altars we had made, in an attempt to remove all trace of magic from the land.~|~translationMissing
That's all very interesting, but what's it got to do with this spell?~|~translationMissing
I'm getting to that!~|~translationMissing
The Fremennik were not as thorough as they thought. They destroyed only the entrances to the altars, for the altars themselves were on a different plane, but they were successful in wiping out our ability to create~|~translationMissing
runes. That ability has only recently been rediscovered on the mainland, so I hear.~|~translationMissing
Our people were left isolated on Lunar Isle but we used it to out advantage. Our control over Magic advanced beyond the need for runes and all knowledge of the altar locations passed from memory. Fortunately,~|~translationMissing
some records survived... The manuscript I discovered contains the teleportation spell to an advanced altar called Ourania. It's an altar that allows the user, regardless of their Runecrafting ability, to craft any~|~translationMissing
type of rune upon it. Ourania is a powerful altar indeed. What state it is in after so many millennia, I know not, but it's interesting all the same.~|~translationMissing
So, will you teach me the spell?~|~translationMissing
*Baby Yaga whispers in your ear*~|~translationMissing
And now you know the teleportation spell, off with you! Go explore.~|~translationMissing
I don't really have time right now.~|~translationMissing
I don't really have ti-~|~translationMissing
*Sigh* Very well. Another time, perhaps.~|~translationMissing
Why do you ask questions if you're going to read my mind anyway?~|~translationMissing
I was being polite, silly foreigner.~|~translationMissing
The Oneiromancer told me you may be able to help...~|~translationMissing
With a potion?~|~translationMissing
I don't think I'll ever get used to you people reading my mind. Yes, a potion of Waking Sleep? I need it to go to the...~|~translationMissing
Dreamland.~|~translationMissing
You know that's really quite rude!~|~translationMissing
Sorry. Carry on.~|~translationMissing
Well, I was hoping you could tell me how to make one?~|~translationMissing
Are you sure you're ready to take on the dream land?~|~translationMissing
There's no harm in trying. Right...?~|~translationMissing
Well, some people have gone mad from visiting their dreams.~|~translationMissing
You really know how to instil discomfort don't you!?! How do you make...~|~translationMissing
You'll need 1 guam leaf, 1 Marrentill leaf and a Suqah tooth ground using a pestle and mortar. Combine these in a vial and BAM! You've got your potion! You should be able to get the ingredients from the~|~translationMissing
Suqah monsters.~|~translationMissing

Eh, I could sort something out for you. Thing is, my brother's got a job guarding the main entrance to the caves. I'd be undercutting him if I let people go down this hole.~|~translationMissing
Oh, does this mean you won't let me go in?~|~translationMissing
No, it means I'd need something to assuage my conscience after betraying my brother. 5,000 trading sticks ought to cheer me up nicely.~|~translationMissing

Bank Camel~|~translationMissing
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm here to help cleanse the Devourer's corruption from this sacred place.~|~translationMissing
I didn't expect a camel to be capable of standing up to such a strong enemy. Aren't you worried for your safety?~|~translationMissing
Not particularly. We camels are known for our durability in harsh environments. I think you should be more concerned about yourself. You humans seem so much more fragile than many other species.~|~translationMissing
I'm sure I'll be fine, but I appreciate your concern.~|~translationMissing
How did you get all my stuff?~|~translationMissing
If the player is an Ultimate Ironman~|~translationMissing
I don't have any of your stuff.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah, I don't use a bank!~|~translationMissing
If the player is not an Ultimate Ironman~|~translationMissing
Don't you understand how banking works? I don't have all of your stuff, I have simply been trained to access the place where it is all stored.~|~translationMissing
But you're a camel. I didn't know camels could train to become bankers.~|~translationMissing
Well there are ghost bankers, gnome bankers, dwarf bankers, goblin bankers and more! Is it really all that surprising that camels can do it too?~|~translationMissing
I suppose when you put it like that...~|~translationMissing
So, what do you make of all this?~|~translationMissing
I mean everything that's been going on here. It seems like a lot to take in.~|~translationMissing
Well, it really was inevitable, which is a shame really. It saddens me to see what has happened to this tomb.~|~translationMissing
Well at least we're fixing it now.~|~translationMissing
We? Are you sure about that? I find you adventurers often have ulterior motives.~|~translationMissing
You may say that you are here to fight the corruption. Indeed, there may be some truth to that. However, would you really be here if there wasn't something for you to gain?~|~translationMissing
I swear, I'm only here to deal with the Devourer's corruption!~|~translationMissing
I hear you speak those words, but I feel no conviction behind them.~|~translationMissing
How can I prove it to you? What is it that you are looking for?~|~translationMissing
Why do you care what opinions a camel has of you?~|~translationMissing
I want everyone to like me.~|~translationMissing
If your only goal in life is to be liked by all, then you'll probably spend the rest of it chasing the impossible.~|~translationMissing
I want to prove you wrong.~|~translationMissing
So you only care because my words cut close to the bone? If you truly want to prove me wrong, then it's your outlook that should change.~|~translationMissing
It seems to be important to you.~|~translationMissing
I do, so tell me, what can I do to show you that not all adventurers are the same?~|~translationMissing
Every adventurer seems to destroy without any thought as to what they are doing, nor with any intent to restore what was lost.~|~translationMissing
If you can do that, then that would prove to me that you are infact different from the rest.~|~translationMissing
Restore what was lost? What do you mean by that?~|~translationMissing
That's for you to figure out.~|~translationMissing
(After completing the "So, what do you make of all of this?" dialogue~|~translationMissing
) What did you ask me to do again?~|~translationMissing
What did you ask me to do again?~|~translationMissing
So you want me to restore what was lost?~|~translationMissing
(After properly dealing with the four MvP items and using the dawn scarab egg on the High Priest of Scabaras~|~translationMissing
) I believe I understand now.~|~translationMissing
I believe I understand now.~|~translationMissing
Well, while us adventurers have been doing our best to fight against the Devourer's corruption, we've been neglecting what has been lost to achieve that goal. Namely, the four guardians we defeated along the way.~|~translationMissing
Ba-Ba was a proud baboon who wished for her troop to flourish. To honour her, I made sure that they won't be forgotten by telling their story to the monkeys of Ape Atoll.~|~translationMissing
Akkha was cruelly denied death by the Devourer, so I gave his ashes to the High Priest of Icthlarin to give him a proper send-off.~|~translationMissing
Zebak was fooled into leaving his home and confined within the tomb, so I took his fang and buried it on an island surrounded by crocodiles.~|~translationMissing
Kephri was promised a future for her race, but it was all a lie. I found a scarab egg within some of her dung, and I gave it to the High Priest of Scabaras to try and nurture it.~|~translationMissing
Well well, colour me impressed adventurer. It seems that you do care after all.~|~translationMissing
It's a shame that much of the damage cannot truly be undone, but I know that Het, Apmeken, Crondis and even Scabaras will be grateful for your actions.~|~translationMissing
I just wish there was more I could do.~|~translationMissing
We always do, but you have still done more than most.~|~translationMissing
Now, I have something for you. I've been looking for someone worthy enough to pass this on to.~|~translationMissing
The bank camel gives you a strange key.~|~translationMissing
A key? What's this for?~|~translationMissing
I'll leave that as another puzzle for you to solve.~|~translationMissing
Well thanks, I guess... You know, out of all the camels I've met, you're definitely the strangest one.~|~translationMissing
Well, it does take a special kind of camel to master the portal magic used for bank access.~|~translationMissing
I've lost that key you gave me.~|~translationMissing
And it conveniently found its way back to me. Try not to lose it this time.~|~translationMissing
If the ancient key has not been obtained yet~|~translationMissing
My name is my own, adventurer. It's hardly important right now.~|~translationMissing
If the ancient key has been obtained~|~translationMissing
Cam the Camel~|~translationMissing
I suppose you've earned the right to know. My name is Cam the Camel.~|~translationMissing
Well, nice to meet you, Cam the Camel. It'll be nice to call you something other than 'the bank camel' from now on.~|~translationMissing
I'm glad I met a kind adventurer such as yourself. I look forward to seeing you continue your diligent work in cleansing this tomb of the Devourer's corruption.~|~translationMissing
If the player already asked them once before~|~translationMissing
As I said, my name is Cam the Camel.~|~translationMissing
Can you follow me into the tomb?~|~translationMissing
Why would I want to do that?~|~translationMissing
It would be very helpful. Think of all the supplies I'd have access to if you came with me and followed me around like a portable bank.~|~translationMissing
But you don't even use a bank.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah! I forgot.~|~translationMissing
What do you take me for? Some kind of pack yak?~|~translationMissing
Besides, if I leave this place then I won't be able to help any other adventurers with their banking needs.~|~translationMissing
I need to get going.~|~translationMissing
If not wearing the camulet~|~translationMissing
The bank camel takes the grain, but quickly spits it out in disgust!~|~translationMissing
If wearing the camulet~|~translationMissing
Bleh, this grain is disgusting! Do you think I am but a simple cow, adventurer?~|~translationMissing
No, no, I was just...~|~translationMissing
This is why I eat the grain in that sack over there. It's specially grown out here in the desert. Once harvested, it goes through a preparation process of several years that...~|~translationMissing
The bank camel talks at length about the process of producing such fine grain...~|~translationMissing
...and that's why this grain is so special. Not to mention so hard to come by.~|~translationMissing
The bank camel happily takes the grain before looking at you as if contemplating something.~|~translationMissing
My, this is some good grain, adventurer! Great flavour profile, not too salty and with just a hint of sweetness. It almost reminds me of...~|~translationMissing
The bank camel looks at you for a moment as if lost in thought.~|~translationMissing
Erm, yes?~|~translationMissing
Oh, never mind, I was just thinking about something.~|~translationMissing
The bank camel stares at you in silence for an uncomfortably long time.~|~translationMissing
Well, I can't stand around here all day. I've got some things I need to take care of.~|~translationMissing
You show the banana to the bank camel.~|~translationMissing
The bank camel looks at you with piqued interest, then rolls their eyes as they realise you can't understand them.~|~translationMissing
Quite the banana you have there! Ba-Ba and her baboon troop were always known for finding the biggest of these. It's a shame that their memory will now disappear into history.~|~translationMissing
You show the fang to the bank camel.~|~translationMissing
Ah, the fang of the mighty Zebak. What a cruel fate to be consumed by ever-lasting hunger.~|~translationMissing
You show the ashes to the bank camel.~|~translationMissing
Ah, the ashes of Akkha, a great warrior. It's a shame that his soul never got to experience the release of death.~|~translationMissing
You show the dung to the bank camel.~|~translationMissing
Faeces! How lovely. If I'm not mistaken, this dung is from Kephri herself, last of the dawn scarabs. It's a shame that her kind have long been lost to the world.~|~translationMissing
You go to search the sack, but the bank camel glares at you menacingly and spits in your direction.~|~translationMissing
Hey, get your hands off my food! Unless you'd like me to start eating the contents of your bank instead!~|~translationMissing
You search the sack and find a needle.~|~translationMissing
Wow! A needle in a hay sack?~|~translationMissing
Wait, isn't it supposed to be a stack, not a sack?~|~translationMissing
And now that I think about it, this sack is full of grain, not hay...~|~translationMissing
You successfully take some grain while the bank camel isn't looking.~|~translationMissing
It's just grain...~|~translationMissing
Well, I'm not entirely sure what else I expected.~|~translationMissing

Bank guard~|~translationMissing
Can I deposit my stuff here?~|~translationMissing
Hello. Can I deposit my stuff here?~|~translationMissing
No. I'm a security guard, not a bank clerk.~|~translationMissing
That wall doesn't look very good.~|~translationMissing
Alright, I'll stop bothering you now.~|~translationMissing
No, it doesn't.~|~translationMissing
Are you going to tell me what happened?~|~translationMissing
I could do.~|~translationMissing
Ok, go on!~|~translationMissing
Someone smashed the wall when they were robbing the bank.~|~translationMissing
Someone's robbed the bank?~|~translationMissing
But... was anyone hurt? Did they get anything valuable?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but we were able to get more staff and mend the wall easily enough.~|~translationMissing
The Bank has already replaced all the stolen items that belonged to customers.~|~translationMissing
Oh, good... but the bank staff got hurt?~|~translationMissing
Yes, but the new ones are just as good.~|~translationMissing
No-one's expecting me to be nice.~|~translationMissing
Anyway... So, someone's robbed the bank?~|~translationMissing
Do you know who did it?~|~translationMissing
We are fairly sure we know who the robber was. The security recording was damaged in the attack, but it still shows his face clearly enough.~|~translationMissing
You've got a security recording?~|~translationMissing
Yes. Our insurers insisted that we install a magical scrying orb.~|~translationMissing
Can I see the recording?~|~translationMissing
I suppose so. But it's quite long.~|~translationMissing
That's ok, show me the recording.~|~translationMissing
Alright... The bank's magical playback device will feed the recorded images into your mind. Just shut your eyes.~|~translationMissing
You close your eyes and watch the recording...~|~translationMissing
Bank robbery recording plays~|~translationMissing
End of recording.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, maybe another day.~|~translationMissing
So who was the robber?~|~translationMissing
I can't disclose that information.~|~translationMissing
Good day, [sir/ma'am].~|~translationMissing
Sorry, I don't want anything.~|~translationMissing
Do you have any idea who robbed the bank yet?~|~translationMissing
The robber in the recording looked familiar.~|~translationMissing
Oh, you recognised him too?~|~translationMissing
If the player has not yet confronted the Wise Old Man about it~|~translationMissing
Yes, and I can tell you where he lives.~|~translationMissing
Thanks, but we already know where to find our suspect.~|~translationMissing
If the player has confronted the Wise Old Man about it already~|~translationMissing
Yes, and he's admitted that he did the robbery!~|~translationMissing
The amount of evidence against him makes that almost unnecessary.~|~translationMissing
So are you going to have him arrested?~|~translationMissing
We're certainly keeping an eye on him. I'm afraid I can't give you any more details about the case.~|~translationMissing
Can I see that recording again, please?~|~translationMissing
I'd like you to pay me 50 gp first.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have at least 50 coins in their inventory~|~translationMissing
I'm not carrying that much.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have at least 50 coins in their bank~|~translationMissing
Oh well, maybe another day.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 50 coins in their bank~|~translationMissing
As a bank employee, I suppose I could take the money directly from your bank account.~|~translationMissing
Ok, you can take 50 gp from my bank account.~|~translationMissing
If the player has at least 50 coins in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Ok, here's 50 gp.~|~translationMissing

Good day, how may I help you?~|~translationMissing

I'd like to buy more bank slots.~|~translationMissing
Why? You don't use the bank.~|~translationMissing
Oh yeah... Never mind then.~|~translationMissing
I can sell you up to [number] additional bank slots in sets of 40. How many are you interested in buying?~|~translationMissing
(Bank space purchase interface opens.)~|~translationMissing
[number] slots please.~|~translationMissing
Buying [number] additional bank slots will cost [number] coins. Be warned, this purchase is not reversible. Are you happy to proceed?~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have enough coins in their inventory~|~translationMissing
Oh... I don't seem to have enough money for that. Never mind.~|~translationMissing
Yes, I'm happy with that.~|~translationMissing
Your additional bank slots have been added.~|~translationMissing
Party! Party!~|~translationMissing

Hello, surface dweller! How can I help you?~|~translationMissing
This is the Bank of Dorgesh-Kaan! Since surface dwellers began coming into the city, we've made an arrangement with the Bank of Gielinor on the surface, so we can act as one of their branches.~|~translationMissing
Hi there, can I help you with anything?~|~translationMissing
Is this a bank?~|~translationMissing
Why yes, what else would it be?~|~translationMissing
Do you get many customers?~|~translationMissing
We?re the only bank on these two islands, so business is pretty good.~|~translationMissing
I?d like to access my account, please.~|~translationMissing

Oh great, another customer. What do you want?~|~translationMissing
What are you doing out here?~|~translationMissing
I used to work in the East Varrock branch. Then a request came in to set up a bank in this new town.~|~translationMissing
The other clerks and myself pulled straws and I was unlucky enough to be sent to this stinking death trap.~|~translationMissing
Now I'm stuck here, ferrying items back and forth to the bank's safe in Varrock for people like you.~|~translationMissing
That doesn't sound very fun, but you're doing a great service for us adventurers.~|~translationMissing
Tell that to my back and legs, I'm exhausted from carrying all this junk back and forth.~|~translationMissing
Hand me a banknote, and I'll try to convert it to an item.~|~translationMissing
Exchange your coins for platinum tokens?~|~translationMissing
The bank exchanges your coins for platinum tokens.~|~translationMissing

Welcome to the Keldagrim bank! Anything I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
Are you with the Bank of Gielinor?~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, we are a branch, but an independent branch.~|~translationMissing
We have liaised with the Bank of Gielinor. It's healthy to keep a bit of trade going with the human population, you know.~|~translationMissing
Was there something else you wanted?~|~translationMissing
How is business?~|~translationMissing
Business has always gone well here, but now more than ever. We are getting a constant supply of gold from the new gold mine south of the city.~|~translationMissing
Oh yes, I helped to open that up you know!~|~translationMissing
Was there anything else I can help you with?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to access my bank account please.~|~translationMissing

We have an agreement with them, yes. It took some time to work out.~|~translationMissing
As you may have noticed, the desert adds complications to all matters of trade and finance.~|~translationMissing
It could be better. The businesses here are still recovering from recent events. Personal banking like yours makes up the majority of our trade.~|~translationMissing
Was there anything else with which I can help you?~|~translationMissing
I'd like to collect items, please.~|~translationMissing

What do you want meat bag?~|~translationMissing
I want to check my PIN settings.~|~translationMissing
I want to collect some items.~|~translationMissing
You blind meat bag? It's a bank. You can store your valuables here... not that I expect you to have any.~|~translationMissing
You blind? It's a bank. You can store your valuables here... if you have any.~|~translationMissing
Banker tutor~|~translationMissing
How do I use the bank?~|~translationMissing
Using the bank itself.~|~translationMissing
Using the bank itself. I'm not sure how....?~|~translationMissing
Speak to any banker and ask to see your bank account. If you have set a PIN you will be asked for it, then all the belongings you have placed in the bank will appear in the window. To withdraw one item, left-~|~translationMissing
click on it once.~|~translationMissing
To withdraw many, right-click on the item and select from the menu. The same for depositing, left-click on the item in your inventory to deposit it in the bank. Right-click on it to deposit many of the same items.~|~translationMissing
To move things around in your bank~|~translationMissing
firstly select Swap or Insert as your default moving mode, you can find these buttons on the bank window itself. Then click and drag an item to where you want it to appear.~|~translationMissing
You may withdraw 'notes' or 'certificates' when the items you are trying to withdraw do not stack in your inventory. This will only work for items which are tradable.~|~translationMissing
For instance, if you wanted to sell 100 logs to another player, they would not fit in one inventory and you would need to do multiple trades. Instead, click the Note button to do withdraw the logs as 'certs' or 'notes',~|~translationMissing
then withdraw the items you need.~|~translationMissing
Using Bank deposit boxes.~|~translationMissing
Using Bank deposit boxes.... what are they?~|~translationMissing
They look like grey pillars, there's one just over there, near the desk. Bank deposit boxes save so much time. If you're simply wanting to deposit a single item, 'Use' it on the deposit box.~|~translationMissing
Otherwise, simply click once on the box and it will give you a choice of what to deposit in an interface very similar to the bank itself. Very quick for when you're simply fishing or mining etc.~|~translationMissing
What's this PIN thing that people keep talking about?~|~translationMissing
The PIN - Personal Identification Number - can be set on your bank account to protect the items there in case someone finds out your account password. It consists of four numbers that you remember and tell~|~translationMissing
no one.~|~translationMissing
So if someone did manage to get your password they couldn't steal your items if they were in the bank.~|~translationMissing
How do I set my PIN?~|~translationMissing
You can set your PIN by talking to any banker, they will allow you to access your bank pin settings. Here you can choose to set your pin and recovery delay. Remember not to set it to anything personal such as~|~translationMissing
your real life bank PIN or birthday.~|~translationMissing
The recovery delay is to protect your banked items from account thieves. If someone stole your account and asked to have the PIN deleted, they would have to wait a few days before accessing your bank account to~|~translationMissing
steal your items. This will give you time to recover your account.~|~translationMissing
There will also be a delay in actually setting the PIN to be used, this is so that if your account is stolen and a PIN set, you can cancel it before it comes into use!~|~translationMissing
How do I remove my PIN?~|~translationMissing
Talking to any banker will enable you to access your PIN settings. There you can cancel or change your PIN, but you will need to wait for your recovery delay to expire to be able to access your bank. This~|~translationMissing
can be set in the settings page and will protect your items should your account be stolen.~|~translationMissing
What happens if I forget my PIN?~|~translationMissing
If you find yourself faced with the PIN keypad and you don't know the PIN, just look on the right-hand side for a button marked 'I don't know it'. Click this button. Your PIN will be deleted (after a delay of a~|~translationMissing
few days) and you'll be able to use your bank as before. You may still use the bank deposit box without your PIN.~|~translationMissing
I know about the PIN, tell me about the bank.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has started Shield of Arrav~|~translationMissing
) Can you tell me where I can find the Phoenix Gang?~|~translationMissing
Can you tell me where I can find the Phoenix Gang?~|~translationMissing
Baraek~|~translationMissing
Sh sh sh, not so loud! You don't want to get me in trouble!~|~translationMissing
So DO you know where they are?~|~translationMissing
I may do.~|~translationMissing
But I don't want to get into trouble for revealing their hideout.~|~translationMissing
Of course, if I was, say 20 gold coins richer I may happen to be more inclined to take that sort of risk...~|~translationMissing
Okay. Have 20 gold coins.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 20 coins~|~translationMissing
Uh....oops. My mistake. I don't have 20 coins. Silly me.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 20 coins~|~translationMissing
Ok, to get to the gang hideout, enter Varrock through the south gate. Then, if you take the first turning east, somewhere along there is an alleyway to the south. The door at the end of there is the entrance to the Phoenix~|~translationMissing
Gang. They're operating there under the name of the VTAM Corporation. Be careful. The Phoenixes ain't the types to be messed about.~|~translationMissing
No, I don't like things like bribery.~|~translationMissing
No. I don't like things like bribery.~|~translationMissing
Heh. If you wanna deal with the Phoenix Gang they're involved in much worse than a bit of bribery.~|~translationMissing
Yes. I'd like to be 20 gold coins richer too.~|~translationMissing
Can you sell me some furs?~|~translationMissing
Yeah, sure. They're 20 gold coins each.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, okay, here you go.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, OK, here you go.~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I don't have enough money!~|~translationMissing
Well, my best price is 18 coins.~|~translationMissing
OK, here you go.~|~translationMissing
If the player does not have 18 coins~|~translationMissing
Oh dear, I don't have that either.~|~translationMissing
Well, I can't go any cheaper than that mate. I've got a family to feed.~|~translationMissing
Oh well, never mind.~|~translationMissing
If the player has 18 coins~|~translationMissing
Baraek sells you a fur.~|~translationMissing
No thanks, I'll leave it.~|~translationMissing
It's your loss mate.~|~translationMissing
20 gold coins? That's an outrage!~|~translationMissing
Well, I can't go any cheaper than that mate. I have a family to feed.~|~translationMissing
Hello. I am in search of a quest.~|~translationMissing
Hello! I am in search of a quest.~|~translationMissing
Sorry kiddo, I'm a fur trader not a damsel in distress.~|~translationMissing
(If the player has grey wolf fur~|~translationMissing
) Would you like to buy my grey wolf fur?~|~translationMissing
Would you like to buy my grey wolf fur?~|~translationMissing
GREY WOLF FUR??? NOW you're talking!~|~translationMissing
Grey wolf fur is something of a desirable item to me.~|~translationMissing
I'll take all you have for 120 gold pieces per fur, does that sound fair?~|~translationMissing
Yep, sounds fine.~|~translationMissing
Yep, that sounds fine.~|~translationMissing
Baereck buys the grey wolf furs one at a time.~|~translationMissing
No! I almost got my throat torn out by a wolf to get this!~|~translationMissing
(If the player is wearing the Ring of charos~|~translationMissing
) [Charm] Are you sure? You don't see quality furs like this too often.~|~translationMissing
Are you sure? You don't see quality furs like this too often.~|~translationMissing
Mmm, let me have another look.~|~translationMissing
If the player has exactly one grey wolf fur~|~translationMissing
That is a really fine piece of fur. Tell you what, I'll give you 150 gold pieces for it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has more than one grey wolf fur~|~translationMissing
Those are really fine pieces of fur. Tell you what, I'll give you 150 gold pieces each for them.~|~translationMissing
Now that's more like it!~|~translationMissing
(If the player has fur or bear fur and no grey wolf fur~|~translationMissing
) Would you like to buy my fur?~|~translationMissing
Would you like to buy my fur?~|~translationMissing
Let's have a look at it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has bear fur~|~translationMissing
You hand Baraek your fur to look at.~|~translationMissing
If the player has exactly one bear fur~|~translationMissing
It's not in the best condition. I guess I could give you 12 coins for it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has more than one bear fur~|~translationMissing
It's not in the best condition. I guess I could give you 12 coins for each one.~|~translationMissing
If the player only has fur and not bear fur~|~translationMissing
If the player has exactly one fur~|~translationMissing
It's not in the best of condition. I guess I could give you 12 coins for it.~|~translationMissing
If the player has more than one fur~|~translationMissing
It's not in the best of condition. I guess I could give you 12 coins for each one.~|~translationMissing
Yeah, that'll do.~|~translationMissing
Baraek buys the bear furs and furs one at a time.~|~translationMissing
I think I'll keep hold of it actually.~|~translationMissing
I think I'll keep hold of it actually!~|~translationMissing
Oh ok. Didn't want it anyway!~|~translationMissing
If the player has exactly one bear fur, or no bear fur and exactly one fur~|~translationMissing
That is a really fine piece of fur. Tell you what, I'll give you 20 gold pieces for it.~|~translationMissing
If the player more than one fur/bear fur~|~translationMissing
Those are really fine pieces of fur. Tell you what, I'll give you 20 gold pieces each for them.~|~translationMissing
Baraek buys the furs one at a time.~|~translationMissing
